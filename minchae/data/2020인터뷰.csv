"CHRISTOPHER CONDON. Thank you. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Mr. Chairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth about one small change I've noted in the statement. It notes that policy will be appropriate to bring-the Committee believes-inflation back to the Committee's 2 percent symmetric inflation objective. That's a slight change from the last time, when you were expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back near the objective. And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last press conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had projected inflation overshoots two or three years out under appropriate monetary policy. Should we take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2 percent outcome for inflation is already baked in the cake, or that this is a signal that the Committee has a stronger resolution to bring inflation at least to the 2 percent objective and put-bring into play an informal makeup strategy for inflation? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, in making that change, our goal was, really-that was, changing ""near"" to ""returning to""-was to avoid possible misinterpretation. So you may remember, in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level. So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we're not comfortable with inflation rising persistently-running persistently below our 2 percent symmetric objective. So, yes, there is something in that. It's just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to 2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around-symmetrically around 2 percent, and that we're not satisfied with inflation running below 2 percent, particularly at a time such as now where we're a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low unemployment when, in theory, inflation should be moving up. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I want to ask about the balance sheet. How many reserves are ""ample""? How many reserves does the Fed now think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework? And can you walk me through how you and your colleagues are arriving at that answer? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, thanks for that question. Why don't I say a few things about repos, since I know that'll be of interest. So, just to bring you back, after last September's brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action, and a result-as a result, money markets have been operating smoothly since then. Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill purchases of at least-of $60 billion-sorry-at least into the second quarter, and term and overnight repo at least through April. And I will get to your specific question. The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly to the federal funds rate, which requires well-functioning money markets. It doesn't mean we're trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets. We know that some volatility is normal and expected in well-functioning markets. And, as I mentioned, these adjustments have been successful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves. Money markets operated smoothly, including right through year-end, and the fed funds rate has remained in our target range. So we know-we will know when these adjustments have run their course when reserves are durably at a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest on reserves and reverse repo, without the need for frequent use of open market operations. Based on current projections, we expect that the bill purchases will durably bring the underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year. And when we see that we've reached that level, we'll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to the level of the underlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities. As our bill purchases bring the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity of overnight and term repo will gradually decline. We've already begun the gradual reduction in the quantity of repo, and we'll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions permit. At some point, we'll also raise the minimum bid rate. Even after we reach an ample level of reserves, it's possible that repo operations might play a role as a backstop and support effective control of the federal funds rate. And we'll continue to discuss that issue and review it under our implementation framework. Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve level, we know that reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account, or TGA. In particular, reserve levels will need to be at a level high enough to remain ample even when the TGA peaks during the April tax season. Effectively, what that means is that we need reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September-and, I would say, around $1½ trillion, subject to learning more. Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I mentioned, and we want to be clear, that will be the bottom end of the range. We want $1½ trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range. So, most of the time, reserves will be moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below $1½ trillion. So it's not an-it's not something that we're aiming at all the time. We know that reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the time. We also want interest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC's target range. And we think that'll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment. Last points-we're committed to making this adjustment process a smooth one. We'll provide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go, as we always have. And we're prepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary policy implementation. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question. Following up on Nick's question, I know you said it's not QE, but it's $390 billion over five months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet. I guess I'd ask one more time on Nick's question-is there a number that you have in mind? Secondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE, and they're trading that way. Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE program, and that the rise in the stock market is linked to it, and you may then experience something of a ""taper tantrum"" the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off? CHAIR POWELL. So I'll just-I'll repeat that-we think that the-we think we need to continue purchases until the-until reserves are at a level at which they will not go below $1½ trillion, roughly, during the course of the calendar year. And we know that the TGA will move up and down there. So they'll be much higher than that some of the time, but that's kind of the number, and we think we'll reach that sometime in the second quarter. That's our estimate. But we will-we'll know it when we get there. We'll know it because we'll be able to be-to control the federal funds rate without use of-without active use, ongoing use of open market operations. You know, our intention of these-for these adjustments is just to raise the level of reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner. And that's-that is our sole intention. I pointed out on other occasions, more than once, the differences-the really specific differences between this and the large-scale asset purchase programs. We've been over that. In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets. It's very hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets. What I can tell you is that you know what our intention is. It is to return reserves to an ample level. We expect that to happen during the second quarter. And our plan as we do that is, as those purchases get to that level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce repo as-as we reach an ample level, as we're satisfying demand now more from underlying reserves from bill purchases rather than from repo. And, again, the last thing I'll say is, we're prepared to adjust the details of this plan as we've shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market. We've recently seen wages moderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others. As you mentioned, at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it seems like we are seeing those wages climb up a little bit, but it doesn't seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average. I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks, or whether you're worried about that, or how you're thinking about it. CHAIR POWELL. The labor market continues to-to perform well. The labor market continues to be strong. We see strong job creation. We see low unemployment. Very importantly, we see labor force participation continuing to move up, really, against expectations. If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecasts suggesting that we could have been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population that we're seeing now, let alone the unemployment level. So I think we've learned quite a lot of good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there's been more room to run. The performance of wages, I think, has to be seen in that context. We saw-if you go back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at around 2 percent, and now they're running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about where they might be at full employment. It would consist of inflation plus-plus productivity growth. The-it's a bit surprising that, with sustained levels of historically low unemployment, we haven't seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and other periods of low unemployment. So you asked, what can be explaining that? You know, one thing can be that the natural rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would appear just from the 3½ percent number. And the other can be, I think, that-as I mentioned, the sort of supply-side shock or surprise that we're receiving from higher labor force participation. People are coming in to the labor market and providing more labor supply, and that is-that's a great thing. That's a very healthy thing. We're a country that has low labor force participation compared to essentially all of our advanced-economy peers, and it's a very good, positive thing. Nonetheless, it represents more labor supply, and it may be holding down wages. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. In terms of the framework review and a little bit on Chris's question earlier, there is a general feeling now in the markets and among analysts that you're basically setting us up for some form of inflation-target averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to make up for the time that it has spent below that. Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where you think you're going to end up? What would you, Chairman Powell, think of that idea personally? And, as long as I'm asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect the results of the review? CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. I'll just say that we undertook the review because we felt, and I felt, that it was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the ""new normal"" into our policy framework. And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower-than-target inflation many places in the world; secondly, a flat Phillips curve, by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization-for example, low unemployment; and, thirdly, a much lower neutral real interest rate here and around the world. So those are challenging conditions for monetary policy to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would say that, under our existing framework, we've been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it for most of the time lately to achieve those goals, although we do struggle, as other central banks do, with the inflation goal. So this is about reviewing our strategy, tools, and communications to assure that they're the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this environment on a sustained basis. And we continued our discussions at this meeting. I'm very, very pleased at the process so far. It's included the 14 Fed Listens events around the country, at which we've engaged with a full range of people and groups across American society. That was a very, very positive experience, and I think we learned a lot. We've now had a series of-a number of FOMC meetings at which we've reviewed what we've learned and also dug deeply into strategy, tools, and communications. I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions around the middle of the year. Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all that together. So I think I'm not the person who should be telling you my personal preferences right now. I'm trying to-and we were trying to come together as a group around a set of answers. I feel very positive about-that we're going to come up with some good results, and I'm just going to have to wait until we get to that point to announce them. DONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Going back to your outlook for global growth, we've seen some significant headwinds, as you mentioned earlier, with the easing-with the partial U.S.-China trade deal, but now that there's some new concern following the outbreak of the coronavirus-that it might shake global growth. We're already seeing reports from Ford and Toyota that they're planning to shut down their assembly plants for an extra week. Apple is rerouting their supply chains. Starbucks is shutting down close to thousands of stores. Are you worried at all about what the impact would be on the U.S. economy, and do you see that as a significant risk-excuse me-to the outlook at this point? CHAIR POWELL. So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I'll turn more to global growth more generally. First, it's a-it's a very serious issue, and I want to start by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already causing. There is likely to be some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already been imposed. Of course, the situation is really in its early stages, and it's very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading partners and neighbors and around the world. So, in light of that uncertainty, I'm not going to speculate about it at this point. I will just tell you that, of course, we are very carefully monitoring the situation. And, you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is, what are the potential ramifications for the U.S. economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate? More broadly, though, if I can talk about the global economy for a second-and if you look at the backdrop, you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the middle of 2018, and then you saw slowing in growth, which lasted right through the end of last year. The fourth-quarter growth globally was quite weak last year, and a number of factors played into that. It wasn't any one factor. There was trade policy uncertainty, absolutely, but also there was the decision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial excesses. There was a turn-downturn in the global high-tech manufacturing cycle in global auto production. There were some idiosyncratic strains in some countries like Argentina, Turkey. And then, later, in Hong Kong and Chile, you had social unrest. So, all of those things were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the course of 2019 and the last half of '18. I would say, now there are grounds for what I would call ""cautious optimism"" about the outlook now for the global economy. Many analysts are predicting a pickup in growth this year, although still to relatively modest growth rates. And I would-people are pointing to, and we would point to, supportive financial conditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a hard Brexit. The high-tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia, including in China. The latest indicators-manufacturing PMIs, for example-suggest that manufacturing may have bottomed out, that they're still below 50 in many jurisdictions, but they have moved up off of their lows. I would-I would just say, none of this is assured. As I mentioned, we saw the fourth quarter of last year came in quite weak-weaker than expected. We are not at all assured of a global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it. And then comes the coronavirus, which, again, it's too early to say what the effects will be. Of course, we're, as I mentioned, monitoring it carefully. There will clearly be implications, at least in the near term, for Chinese output and, I would guess, for some of their close-in neighbors, and we'll just have to see what the effect is globally. BRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times. As recently as 2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band, sort of dragging the fed funds rate up. Over the course of the adjustments since last year, it's moved steadily down, closer to the bottom of the band. So, if you're moving it back up, how high do you want to get it? Are we looking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves to the middle of the band? And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we're approaching ""ample""? CHAIR POWELL. So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well within the range. That's it. Well within the range. And that, clearly, you know-5 basis points from the bottom or from the top isn't that. So that's why we moved back up. You're right. Last year we were-we saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system. We saw the-gradually moving up. And, in hindsight, we know what was happening. With ample reserves, we see-we see that it's possible to bring the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis points. So now we're-now we are well within the range, I would say. BRENDAN GREELEY. We are. So you don't think that, as the fed funds goes back up towards the center of the range, that IOER is going to end up at the top? CHAIR POWELL. Don't know that. We want it to be well within the range. I think we'll continue to adjust it to the extent it's appropriate. Ultimately, what we're trying to do is deliver a federal funds rate that's well within the range. IOER is just a tool to do that. If we-if we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we'll do that. It just means-I mean, the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate-which is the rate that, of course, transmits into other money market rates, which ultimately transmit into all kinds of financial conditions-that's what we care about. So, ultimately, we will-we will use that tool to keep it well within the range. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Just to sort of close the loop on one thing, where do discussions stand on a standing repo facility? Because what you've said so far sort of implies that there won't be one or that it will be a limited one. So if you could just, you know, let us know where that discussion stands. And also- UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER. Can you turn mic over? Turn the mic over. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Sorry about that. Sorry about that. Did you get the question? Did you hear the question okay? CHAIR POWELL. I did. I don't think-I'm not sure your colleagues did. [Laughter] HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Where do the discussions stand on standing repo? [Aside] That was great. And the other thing is, on the, you know, on the standing repo facility and on the purchases-Treasury bill purchases, as you enter this new regime later in the second quarter or later in the year, will that be preannounced by amounts? Will there be preset amounts like you're doing now, or will that just be something that people will have to sort of intuit and figure out as you go along? CHAIR POWELL. So I'll go in reverse order. When we-when we make decisions about the steps we're going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some length, we'll be making them as early as we can and as transparently as we can-and specifically. But we're not at that stage. It's January, and we're several months away from-from that. In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned in, I guess, in my answer to an earlier question, there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we're at an ample-reserves level. Now, we haven't decided what that role is, we have not decided-we haven't at all made a decision on a standing repo facility. We haven't. We've had a couple of discussions about it, as you know, back in, I guess, June and October. And there's a range of views. We're going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question. And I think it was wise to wait, because we're still getting a better sense of what that-what that world looks like. And, you know, it's really going to be a question of, how useful will it be? What will be the costs and benefits? And my thinking is, we will return to that fairly soon, and I wouldn't assume a decision one way or the other. Really, we haven't made one, because we haven't had to. And I think you-when you delay, you get more information by waiting. It's good to wait. We don't have any urgency in making that decision, because we're still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we're in an ample-reserves regime. HEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. I'm wondering, do you think that there is a financial stability risk from climate change? You've spoken several times that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that's sort of one institution. Do you think there's a systemwide risk that may-that could develop from climate change? CHAIR POWELL. So that's an interesting question-the question being, is there a systemwide financial stability risk? I'd say, over-over the longer term, it's certainly possible, and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we're thinking about climate change as an institution. So, as I've mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue, but it's essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federal government and state governments for leadership on that. And, importantly, society's overall response to climate change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed. All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we've got a monetary policy mandate and, more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we're supervising financial markets, utilities, and financial institutions, banks. And we haven't-we share overall responsibility for financial stability with a number of agencies. And that latter part-I think the public has every right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust against the risks from climate change. Now, I think that's got to be right. We are in the very early stages, as are other central banks, in understanding just what that means. And there's quite a lot of work going on around the world at other central banks and at the Fed, too, to think that through. But I do think it's-in that sense, it has to be part of our role, and-but not the overall response of society to climate change. That's not us. HEATHER LONG. And if I could follow up, can you clarify why the Fed hasn't signed on to the Network for Greening the Financial System like 40 other central banks have? CHAIR POWELL. So we've attended all of their meetings and taken part in them, and we've been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that. We probably will do that at some point. So that's-that's an ongoing question. But we're very much attending those meetings and taking part in them. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today. Mid-February, the phase-one China deal gets-goes into effect. Have you seen business investment pick up at all? If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty is-is being cleared up? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I guess I'd start by saying that the fact that we've reached a phase-one deal with China and the fact that we've moved ahead closer to getting USM[C]A agreed-those are potentially positive things for the economy without question. Without question. And financial markets-the reaction of financial markets is very consistent with that perception. A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment, investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy. It's important, though, to bear in mind a couple of things. First, trade policy uncertainty remains elevated. Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk. We still have two or even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now. So it hasn't gone away, and we've just come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments-sorry, contacts in the business world. And I think, clearly, these are seen as positive developments going forward, but there's a bit of a wait-and-see attitude-is this going to be sustained? The agreements have to be implemented, too, and that'll take quite some time. So, I would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy. There's also the global economy. You could-you could well see manufacturing-as I mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced economies and emerging market economies. We do not see a decisive recovery, but it's possible that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial conditions could spur further growth. MICHAEL DERBY. Hi, Mike Derby with Dow Jones. Do you have any greater sense of what-what was going wrong with the repo market starting in September? There seemed to be, you know-whether it was a one-off event, you know, too tight around tax payments and debt settlement, or whether there's a more enduring issue going on with the market, more structural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. As for those forces, so, as we indicated, we would undertake a, you know, serious review of that question and look at both our regulations and also supervisory practices. And we'd be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow more easily in the system as long as it didn't undermine safety and soundness. And so we've undertaken that, and we've done a ton of work, actually. We don't have anything to announce here today, but I feel good about the-what we've learned there. I think-you mentioned other factors. We will be announcing our findings. I'm not going to give you a time, but we're-we're well along in that assessment at this time. I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to conduct our operations without frequent resort to open market operations was higher than we had thought and was higher than others had thought, too. We learned that we can't let reserves-we shouldn't let reserves go below $1½ trillion-roughly, the level of early September-at any point. And that means that reserves will move through in a range over the course of the year that will be substantially higher than $1½ [trillion], but they won't ever go below. So $1½ [trillion] is not a target level. It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be expected to move. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Mr. Chairman. I just wanted to ask about how your balance sheet operations and repo-temporary repos-how they affect the system and who they're helping. Clearly, they're mostly designed, as you said, to get-keep the fed funds rate in the range you're looking for. But, certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds and other Wall Street institutions. And so, how would you explain to, sort of, Main Street why you're doing all this for that market? And how would you address criticism that it is helping mostly Wall Street, along with everything else? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important reason for caring about money market operations generally, and that just is that we are-our monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets-through the money markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions. So we care that money markets are operating smoothly. And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in September. And so we acted. This is a one-time thing that we're doing to adjust the level of reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smoothly on an ongoing basis. Repo markets are important, because that's where Treasury securities-the purchase of Treasury securities, which is the way-you know, the federal-part of the way the federal government is funding its operations. It's the way those are financed. So these are largely Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers to-for distribution to-and buyers, to a substantial extent. That's what's going on in the Treasury repo market. So it's just the financing for-for that. Now, again, we don't-that activity is a-is a market activity. We're not looking to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all. What we care about is that volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of-of our policy decisions to federal funds rate, and that really is important for the public. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, is the Fed going to vote tomorrow on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks investing in venture capital funds? What can you tell us about what the Fed is considering? And why make those changes? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a-a new part of-part of the existing Volcker rule, and that is the covered fund provisions of the rule. And we'll be making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the law. We're going to put those proposals out for public discussion, and we're going to listen carefully, as we always do, to public comments on those proposals. Again, we believe that they will be-and you'll see them tomorrow-will be public-you know, will be publicly-we have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Now, is this just the venture capital funds, or are also you changing the rules for hedge funds and private equity funds? CHAIR POWELL. It's covered funds. It's-so it's that covered-so it's not the proprietary trading part of Volcker. It's the covered funds part. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And is there a chance that banks could take this and run and maybe even get involved in mortgage-backed securities again and risky investments? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we'll-we think that what we're doing is-is very consistent with safety and soundness and absolutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the Volcker rule. We'll be-we'll be getting comments from people, and we'll be looking into that question, among many others. GREG ROBB. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Powell. I'd like to turn your attention back to China and the health of its financial sector in particular. And I guess I'm basing my question on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month. Just-in March of that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, and one of your colleagues on the FOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt-hit the U.S. economy. And the staffer said that there was a-what they were worried about was that not only was the Chinese economy slowing down, but there was the financial sector. And the quote was: ""There's a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China."" Now, I was wondering if you could give us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector. And how do you think it might impact the economy, particularly now that they've been hit by this unexpected shock? CHAIR POWELL. Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that period-2014 up until, I guess, '17 or '18, and I thought-which was essentially just a lot of debt for an emerging market. For an economy at the-at the stage of evolution of the Chinese economy, they had very high levels of debt-not sovereign debt the way we think of it, but more business debt-debt of state-owned enterprises and also just private businesses. And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control-to stop the growth and to control it. And that-as I mentioned, that's one of the reasons why Chinese growth slowed, and it's one of the reasons why global growth slowed, because we felt that. And they've actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing. The authorities have stuck to that and have, again, continued to try to do that, so-to try to control the growth of debt. And that's important that they do that. We don't think that-that there's any imminent risk there, although you-as you point out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will-will have some effects on the Chinese economy, at least in the short term. The Chinese economy is very important in the global economy now. And, you know, we-when China's economy slows down, we do feel that-not as much as countries, though, that are near China or that trade more actively with China, like some of the Western European countries. We still have-you know, 85 percent of our economy is domestic. And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other economies just because of our physical location. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi. Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Finance. So the combination of T bill purchases and repo operations have been described colloquially as ""liquidity."" I'm just wondering if you semantically agree with that description-then, secondly, what the impact of that has been on risk assets. I don't know if that's something that, you know, the Board or Reserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been. How are you kind of thinking about that going forward? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Well, so, two questions. I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what we're doing is what I said: We're trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that banks can meet their reserve requirements, and that there's enough reserves in the system that we don't see reserve scarcity, and we don't have to use repo operations to provide additional reserves. So I think, as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace sometime in the second quarter. In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it's very hard to say what is affecting financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time. It's not our intention to change the stance of monetary policy. These were designed to provide more reserves and, really, to do that in order to enable better transmission of our-of our rate decisions into the economy under our chosen framework. That's really the purpose of what we're doing. JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with MNI. I wanted to ask about the framework review again. Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period-would that call for a different policy stance if you made that shift? And whether or not we know the answer to that question, would the Fed consider changing the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was no change to the economic outlook? CHAIR POWELL. Well, as you know, we're comfortable with our current policy stance. We think it's appropriate. We think it'll remain appropriate as long as data coming in are broadly in keeping with our outlook. Over time-over time, though-let me take a step back. Over time, an average inflation-targeting framework would be different than our current framework, in the sense that it wouldn't be a-there would be some aspect of trying to make inflation average 2 percent over time, which means, if it runs below 2 percent for a time, it has to run above to bring the average up. So that is a different framework. Our current framework is one where we say-or we'd be equally concerned with deviations of inflation from target on either side. But that isn't-that doesn't suggest an intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric. In other words, that would-consistent with that would be having all the deviations be on one side, which is what we've had, actually. So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different approach to policy. Again, I'm not trying to-I don't want to comment on the current stance of policy, which we do think is appropriate. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. I wanted to ask you about the stock market. By historical comparisons, as you know, valuations are considerably high. And I just wonder how much discussion and concern you and your colleagues have about that and what risks you see for the economy. CHAIR POWELL. So we-we look at a very broad range of financial conditions where-there isn't any one financial condition that we-that we look at. And when we look at financial conditions, what matters for the real economy is substantial changes in-or, material changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time. If I can, maybe I'll-maybe I'll answer that in the context of our overall financial stability framework. That's one way to look at it. So we look at-when we look at financial stability, we look at-really, we've got four pillars to that, the first of which is leverage in the financial system that is at a comfortable level. Our banks, particularly our large banks, have high levels of capital. The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and businesses. Households' debt to GDP is-has been coming down since the financial crisis. It's not moving up. It's at low-low levels compared to what it was before the crisis. So not every household-but, in the aggregate, household debt is in a good place, a very good place. Business debt has been moving up. We've been calling that out for more than a year-substantially more than a year, and it's something we're focused on. And we've taken appropriate measures and are monitoring carefully. But we think it's not something that would threaten financial stability, but more be an amplifier. The other one is asset purchases, getting to your-sorry, asset prices, getting to your question. We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated-I do-somewhat elevated. If you look at risk spreads, they're narrow. If you look at P/Es, they're high. I think the way to think about-a good way-one way to think about equity prices, though, is, what's the premium you're getting paid to own equities rather than risk-free debt? And that's also at fairly low levels, but not extremely low levels. So valuations are high, but not at extremes. The final factor is funding risk. Are big financial institutions and other players in the financial system funded with stable funding, or is there a lot of run risk? And the answer is, very stable funding, for the most part. So if you look at, overall-what you see, in my view, is, vulnerabilities to the financial-to financial stability are moderate overall. KATY O'DONNELL. Hi. Katy O'Donnell, Politico. I wanted to know, do you support Governor Brainard's vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform? And is this something that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point? CHAIR POWELL. So let me say that I think this is a good time to do-to update CRA, really, in a way that is a win-win both for the intended beneficiaries-low- and moderate-income communities-and also for banks that would like to have more certainty about-about what does and doesn't qualify and that sort of thing. The law can both be more effective and more efficient is-it comes down to. And we think this is a good way. It's also just a good time to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and demographic change as well. We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies. We think that an interagency final rule together would be the best outcome. We're sorry we haven't been able to get there, and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to. We spent a lot of time on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform. You saw Governor Brainard's recent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis. And we haven't made any decisions about what we're going to do, about whether we'll propose-I mean, our focus has been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really. So we haven't made any decisions about what we're going to do going forward. In terms of, you know-Governor Brainard led our oversight committee over these activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high priority for us. I was comfortable with her speech, and I'm comfortable with the work we've done and with the Fed's position on this. As I said, we haven't chosen to bring a proposal forward. We haven't decided what to do, whether-going forward. And we're not going to comment on the other proposal. It's just not appropriate to do. It's not about us. It's not about our views. It's about the views of the interested parties. HANNAH LANG. Hannah Lang with American Banker. Thank you for being here today. I wanted to ask about Vice Chair Quarles's recent speech on bank supervision in which he laid out some suggestions for making changes to the supervisory regime. I wanted to ask, do you agree with his approach? And are there any plans to codify some of these suggestions later in the year? CHAIR POWELL. So I do agree that-the principles that he articulated of firm and fair supervision and effective transparency in communications. I also think it's a good thing that we would have brighter lines to define our LISCC supervisory portfolio, which we haven't really had to date. Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn't mean that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change. So-and I also thought that, you know, the-he's raising some very interesting questions about, if you-in the first part of the speech, where he's talking about regulation and supervision and, you know, how to-how to balance the desire for transparency and due process in everything the government does with the needs of confidential supervision. It's a very challenging question. It's one that could use further thought. And as far as the specific, you know, proposals, there's-you know, they're interesting, you know, and need further development and will need lots of comment and that sort of thing. MARK HAMRICK. Thank you. Here we go. Sorry, I had it [the microphone] upside down. That's not too good. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Thank you. I wanted to ask you a question about the-one of the unintended consequences over the years-long low interest rate environment, and that is that savers haven't gotten as much return as would have otherwise been the case. What would you say to those individuals who've seen the Fed again cutting rates, eroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings? And how much would you take their plight into consideration? How much can you sympathize with them? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we-we are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use our tools to pursue maximum employment and stable prices. And that's what-that's our focus. Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it's a powerful one. So I think if you look-look at the time since the financial crisis. That was-in the week [wake] of fairly modest growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market. And part of that just is the effect of lower interest rates. So, if-so many, many people benefit from low interest rates. In fact, you don't hear-when you talk to the low- and moderate-income communities, one thing you don't hear is, ""You ought to raise rates."" That's not what you hear. You hear quite the opposite, which is, you know, ""Please do whatever you can to keep this expansion going."" I absolutely sympathize with people. If you're living on just the interest in a bank or on fixed-income generally, then that's a challenging thing. On the other hand, if you own a home, home values-the housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so-but, yes, for some people who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be challenging. I mean, we have to do what's best for the-for the overall society and the economy. That's-those are our orders from Congress. Thanks very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. The Chair will now take some questions. Please dial ""star 1"" on your phone to indicate you want to ask a question. You will be unmuted when you are called on. [Extended silence] Okay, CNBC. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, how effective do you expect this-these actions to be? Do you-do you think a recession is inevitable and/or can be avoided? Secondly, there was talk about additional programs that could come out-for example, a Primary Dealer Credit Facility or a Term Auction Facility. Do you expect those to be announced soon? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, based on our discussions today and many conversations with participants, it's fair to say that we have a range of views about the path of the economy, as is always the case with the Fed. But, in general, I'd say that we see the U.S. economy as having been in quite a strong position before the arrival of the virus. We see that it is likely that the measures we take to protect ourselves from the virus will involve withdrawing from or reducing certain activities-thinking there of travel, leisure, hospitality, those things-and that's going to mean lower economic activity for a period of time. These are choices that we make to protect ourselves-appropriate choices that we make to protect ourselves from the virus. So that means that the second quarter is probably going to be weak-in fact, in the view of many, output declining-output lower in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. After that, it's very hard to say how big the effects will be or how long they will last. And that's going to depend, of course, on how widely the virus spreads, which is something that is highly uncertain, and I would say, in fact, unknowable. We do know that the virus will run its course and that the U.S. economy will resume a normal level of activity. In the meantime, the Fed will continue to use our tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and support demand with monetary policy-ultimately, to do what we can to see that the recovery is as vigorous as possible. You also asked about other facilities. I would point out that we have, of course, responded very strongly not just with interest rates, but also with liquidity measures today. And we believe that what we did today will be beneficial to financial markets generally. And as I said in my statement, we're prepared to use our full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thanks. We'll go to Marketplace radio. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I'm wondering, are you considering negative interest rates at this point? Is there a scenario in which you think that would be appropriate? CHAIR POWELL. So, as I've noted on a number of occasions, really, the Committee-as you know, we did a year-plus-long study of our tools and strategies and communications. And we, really, at the end of that, and also when we started out, we view forward guidance and asset purchases-asset purchases and also different variations and combinations of those tools as the basic elements of our toolkit once the federal funds rate reaches the effective lower bound-so, really, forward guidance, asset purchases, and combinations of those. You know, we looked at negative policy rates during the Global Financial Crisis, we monitored their use in other jurisdictions, we continue to do so, but we do not see negative policy rates as likely to be an appropriate policy response here in the United States. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we're going to the Wall Street Journal. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I guess I wanted to understand, specifically, how the actions you've announced this evening will get credit to households and firms that are going to see large drops in income and revenue. And also, to the extent that they are needed, what steps would you recommend the fiscal authorities undertake-again, to make sure that firms with large drops in income and revenue don't go bust over the next few weeks or months? CHAIR POWELL. So let me tell you how, I think-what our tools can accomplish, and-and really what they're not designed to accomplish. So what our liquidity operations-and I'll talk specifically about the Treasury and MBS purchases-are designed to do is to assure the proper functioning of the Treasury and MBS markets. The Treasury market is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, market in the world. It's probably the most liquid large market in the world. The MBS market is very important: It's closely linked to the Treasury market, and it's the way that our monetary policy decisions flow through to borrowers in the real economy. So, two very important markets. And they had reached levels of very high illiquidity, and-to the point where we-as you know, last week we offered financing-very large amounts of financing. And after that, we bought assets across the curve to try to support liquidity and return to normal function. And we found that that helped, but, nonetheless, we thought we had to do more. And we knew what we had to do, which was the asset purchase programs that we did today. And those are designed to restore those key markets to normal function. Now, why is that important to-to everyone? These markets are part of the foundation of the global financial system and of the United States financial system. And if they are not functioning well, then other markets-then that will spread to other markets. And those are the markets that-that amount to-that-where households and businesses typically get credit. So we know that dysfunctional financial markets-a dysfunctional financial system, really, can have very big negative effects on the economy. We saw that during the financial crisis. This is a very different situation, but, nonetheless, we thought it was quite important for us to take strong measures to support-to support proper market function in these important markets. Now, you asked about households. It's true, we don't have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work or whose businesses may not-may experience a period of very low activity. We don't have those tools. We have the tools that we have, and we use them. I think we've used them quite aggressively for the benefit of the public. But this is a multifaceted problem, and it requires answers from different parts of the government and society. I mean, I think that, by far, the most important is the response of the health-care workers and health-care policymakers. After that, fiscal policy. We've had one round of fiscal policy, another coming. I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief, really, to particular populations and groups. Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know-our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they're under stress, and that's-that's really part of what we did today. The other role is to support demand through lower interest rates, and we did that. You-you asked about fiscal as well, and I guess I've sort of covered that. We do think fiscal response is-is critical, and we're happy to see that those measures are being considered, and we-we hope they are effective. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we're going to go to Fox Business. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. In your statement, you say that the market measures of inflation have declined. The Fed has undershot inflation in the last year, and that's become one of the focuses of the FOMC meetings. Now, does the Federal Reserve see deflation coming, and is this large cut meant to get in front of any more inflation? Plus, as a second question, would the Fed consider buying securities outside of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So, on-on inflation, you know, the-the economy's performed so well, really, over the last few years, and right up through January: historically low unemployment-50 year-low unemployment for a couple of years, 11 years-almost 11 years of expansion so far, and yet inflation lingered below 2 percent. So we've been concerned that inflation not move down further. It's not at all a question of deflation. It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way. So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the-the net effects of this will be to-to have inflation move down even a little bit more. And it's-it's not a question-it's not-it's not an issue of deflation. Again, it's just an issue of inflation probably falling even a bit further. We expect, with uncertainty, that, you know-that it will fall a little bit further, at least, below where it has been. We are-of course, we don't have the legal authority to buy other securities other than the ones we already buy, and we're not seeking authority to do so. We haven't discussed that at the-at the FOMC, and it's not-it's not legal authority that we're seeking. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to the Financial Times. BRENDAN GREELEY. Thank you, Chair Powell. This is Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times. You have talked about the mortgage-backed security purchases and the Treasury purchases as a stability-a stability operation. I'm pretty sure that every person on this call has an editor asking to determine whether or not this is quantitative easing. How do we draw a distinction between these asset purchases and something you may do in the future that is explicit quantitative easing? Or can we think of this as the first step in quantitative easing? CHAIR POWELL. So what-what I can tell you definitively is what the purpose of the asset purchases was, and I mentioned this in my statement. And it really is to support the availability of credit in the economy-households and businesses-and thereby support the overall economy. How do they do that? They do that by supporting proper market functioning in the Treasury market and the MBS market. So you see-and I think you'll see-as these purchases roll forward, you will see the Treasury market and the MBS market returning to normal market function, and that will actually support economic activity. That will be a positive for economic activity. In terms of what it's labeled, that's of less interest to me. I really think we are very clear in our minds what we're doing this for and what the logical effects would be, which would be-which would be both better market function and-and-you know, when there's better market function, it will be-you know, policy will be supporting the economy better. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Bloomberg TV. MICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to ask some timing questions here. First, on the-whatever it is, QE or not QE, you talk in the press release about increase ""over coming months."" Is there a timetable for that? How long are we talking about-$700 billion, obviously, over two months is a lot different from $700 billion over the course of a year. And do you have a date where you would reevaluate and perhaps add more or end the program? And the same with the interest rate cut to zero-how long do you think that might last, and would you be inclined to quickly go back to a higher level, the 100 basis points or more that you cut it from? Or would you anticipate that this will be a long, slow process going back? CHAIR POWELL. Okay, so-sorry. MICHELLE SMITH. Mike, can you ask your question? CHAIR POWELL. What was it again? What was the question again? Just tell me. I can't read my writing. [Laughter] MICHAEL MCKEE. I was asking about timing. How long a period- CHAIR POWELL. Ah, okay, great. MICHAEL MCKEE. -are we talking about for the QE purchases, and how long do you anticipate keeping rates low, and how fast would you bring them back up again? CHAIR POWELL. Okay, sorry. So that's the ""in coming months"" language. Let me tell you what we were doing there. So there's no monthly cap here. There's no weekly cap. The Desk is going to go out, and it's going to buy at a strong rate that is-that we think will restore market function-restore liquidity as quickly as it can be restored. And that language is open ended, and it's meant to send a signal to the market that-that, you know, we're not going to be bound by, for example, $60 billion a month or anything like that. We're going to go in strong starting tomorrow, and we're going to buy across the curve, and we're going to buy MBS, and we're really going to use our tools to do what we need to do here, which is restore these important markets to normal function. So that-that's really what that is. As far as-as the policy rate, what we've said is that we will maintain the rate at this level until we're confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. So, you can see, that's the test we've written down. And if you-if you look at it, you'll see that some things have to happen before we'd consider-we'd have to become confident of-that the economy has weathered these recent events and also is on track to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals. So that's a test we'll be looking at, and I think it suggests that, you know, we're going to be watching and willing to be patient, certainly. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we're going to go to the Associated Press. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, it's Chris Rugaber at AP. In 2008, you had a lot of coordination between the White House at that time, the Fed, the Treasury-Bernanke doing a lot of things with Paulson and so forth. You know, today the White House had its press conference at 5:00. You guys are doing something a little separate. Is there-do you think it would be more helpful to markets-perhaps, in the broader economy, to have a more coordinated response? Is that something we might look for in the future? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I would say this. You know, we have different tools. I think we do, actually, work pretty closely with the Treasury Department and-and cooperate with them on things, with clear lines of delineation. For example, the Treasury Department has authority over fiscal policy. That's not our job. It's their job, with other parts of the Administration. It's just that-like that for us with monetary policy. We have sole responsibility for monetary policy and strong instructions from Congress to conduct it in an independent, nonpolitical way. So those two things are-one for each of us. But in the middle there, there are areas where we-where we can cooperate. And also, there's a long history. You would want the finance ministry and the treasury [and the central bank] to be talking in every major economy in the world. You would want them to be regularly exchanging information-professional relationships not just at the, you know, the Chair-to-Treasury-Secretary level, but also through the organization. For example, the New York Fed is the Treasury's agent-fiscal agent, as you know, so there's a lot that goes into debt management and the issuance of debt, which happens at the New York Fed. So I think we do, actually-we have professional, good working relationships up and down the chain there, and, you know, that-that seems to me to be working. And there is-there's also quite a lot of coordination in other respects with-of course, with foreign central banks, but you didn't ask about that. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we're going to go to the Washington Post. [Silence] Washington Post, are you there? HEATHER LONG. Hey, sorry, I'm here. I think-hi, Chair Powell. Two questions this evening. First, have you personally been tested for coronavirus, and are you working from home? If you could shed some light on the precautions you're taking. And, second, do you believe the Fed has sufficient tools at the moment, or are you seeking congressional action to expand your tool set? CHAIR POWELL. So I feel fine. I feel very well, and so there's no reason for me to be tested. We are observing-we're trying to model good behavior here, so we're observing quite a lot of teleworking. And also, we're-you know, we're not having a lot of big, crowded meetings-we're not having any big, crowded meetings. So we're trying to observe all of the things that the professionals tell us to do. I do expect to do some teleworking because I want to model that-that it's okay for the people to do so. In fact, it's important for them to do so. So I will do that. In terms of our-of our toolkit, let me say first that, you know, I think we do have plenty of space to adjust our policy. I mentioned our liquidity tools-you know, we have a lot of power in our liquidity tools, and, as I mentioned, we're prepared to use them. In addition, we've got plenty of space left to offer forward guidance, asset purchases, and adjust those policies, so I think we do have room. We-we have not at all made a decision to request further-further tools or authorities from Congress, no. We-we have not made that decision. It is not something we're actively considering right now. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to the New York Times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. This is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm just curious-you know, obviously, you held this meeting in lieu of your meeting later this week. Will you still release a Summary of Economic Projections? And if not, how should we understand how you guys are thinking about the economy as the coronavirus shapes up? CHAIR POWELL. So why no-I guess you're asking, why no SEP, and what's our forecast? So a couple reasons we didn't do an SEP. First, we decided on Thursday to move the meeting up by three days to today, and that's before the SEPs are generally filed. They hadn't been filled out, and we-frankly, we spent our time focused on getting ready to make these announcements. Second, and, you know, a number of FOMC participants had already reached out to make the point that the economic outlook is evolving on a daily basis, and it really is depending heavily on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to affect it and how long that goes on. And that is just not something that's knowable. So, actually, writing down a forecast in that circumstance didn't seem to be useful, and, in fact, it could have been more of an obstacle to clear communication than a help. I do expect that we'll return to the quarterly-regular quarterly cycle in June, however. In terms of the forecast, so, as I mentioned, you know, we see the U.S. economy starting out strong-from a strong position, different-different as we-as we talked through it today. People have a range of perspectives on the way the year is going to go, but I think there's a pretty broad sense that the second quarter will be a weak quarter, with probably out-you know, output declining a bit. After that, it becomes hard to say, you know, what'll happen in the third and fourth quarters and thereafter, and it's going to depend, again, on-on the path of the virus. So the thing we do know is that we'll be here doing our job and supporting the flow of credit and there to do what we can when the recovery comes to make it as vigorous as possible. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Now we'll go to Bloomberg News. CRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell. Craig Torres at Bloomberg News. You say the path of the economy more or less depends on the path of the virus. How important is fiscal policy now in determining whether this sudden stop in activity is long or short and of high human consequence or little human consequence? And, second, can you talk a little bit about what's on your dashboard for economic and financial indicators that you're going to be watching day to day? I know Vice Chair Clarida said that we should start seeing the data show up in April. What are you going to be watching, and what should we be watching? CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of fiscal policy, I think in the first instance-and you're-you're seeing some of this now-is the thing that fiscal policy and, really, only fiscal policy can do is reach out directly to affected industries, affected workers, and we've seen some of that. So, that's-that's an important job for fiscal policy. More broadly, after that, there's the question of-of fiscal-broader fiscal stimulus, and I think that'll depend on the path of the economy. I-I think there is such a wide range of possibilities here that it's some-it's very hard to predict. But there could certainly be-there could certainly be, you know, a need for that. And your second question was-what was your second question? CRAIG TORRES. Yes. It was on what indicators you're going to be looking at, financial and real. CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think, in the very near term, we're going to be looking at, you know, the Treasury market function. We're really going to be looking to see that financial markets are returning to more liquid, more normal functioning. That is an essential part of our job. That is-actually, you know, that is the thing that central banks were originally designed to do, was to provide liquidity to financial systems in stress, so we take that job very seriously. It's probably the most important thing we're doing now is that. So we'll be watching that and we'll be prepared to use our tools when and as appropriate to address-to-to support market functioning and really to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Those are the things I'll be looking at. You know, in terms of economic data, I think it's just so early. You know, we're really looking-I mean, the economic data will follow the data on the spread of the virus. You know, I think what happens-what happens during the spread of the virus is probably not going to tell you a lot about where the economy will be in six months. It's going to be-because you may have a-you probably have a bad quarter in the second quarter, but if things get better in the third quarter, that probably won't matter so much. We may be able to come back from that. If it lasts longer-so that's really what I'll be looking for, is-is what is going to be the spread of the virus and what's the path it's going to take and what are the effects on the economy. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to NBC News now. DAVID GURA. Hi, Chair Powell. This is David Gura from NBC News. And a lot of good questions here, so I'll-I'll turn to one that's more philosophical in nature. And you've talked a bit about the-the disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak and having lower economic activity for a period of time. I'm reckoning with fact that my kid's going to be out of school until April 20 at the earliest, so we're feeling this very, very acutely. But I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the time horizon here and put that into some broader context-how you look at this and how anomalous this thing is with which you and your colleagues are going to have to reckon. That's my first question. The second is, you know, we've seen a variety of tools here deployed over these last few weeks, and the market-which I know is something that you pay at least minimal attention to-has reacted negatively to some of that. What do you make of that? Going back to the question that was asked earlier about the toolbox and-and what's left-what's left in it, rates are low. Does that provoke any apprehension, any nervousness on your part that there are fewer tools therein? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess your first question is, how-how do we think about the time-the time for this thing? You know-and the truth is, we just don't know, and, you know, the experts we talk to will say that they don't know, and that it's, in fact, unknowable. It's going to depend on a number of things. First, it's the measures that we take to, you know, to-with the social distancing, and the-all the things businesses and school and everyone's doing now. And that will depend, to some extent, on how compliant people are. You can see that some countries have had a-have been able to, through aggressive measures and really high compliance-have been able to bend the curve and-and do that. And whether we succeed or-you know, that's really the question. And I wouldn't-I wouldn't, you know-I'll resist the impulse to guess. I really don't know what that will be. In terms of the toolbox, as I mentioned, we think we have plenty of policy space left, plenty of power left in our tools, and I would point in particular to the liquidity tools. That, I think, is-is right now the most important thing that we're doing. Our interest rates will matter-cuts will matter now to borrowers who will get some relief from our cuts, but they'll matter a lot more when the economy begins to recover. So-but in the forefront now are the liquidity tools and-and getting that job done well. In addition, as I mentioned, we-you know, we have room to provide forward guidance, to do more asset purchases. I think there-there is room for us to do what we need to do. I-I would just close, though, by saying that, you know, typically, fiscal policy does play a major role when-when there are downturns. You saw-you've seen that in many past downturns, and that's beyond just the automatic stabilizers. Sometimes fiscal policy comes in on a discretionary basis, and that-that will probably need to be the case here as well. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. Thanks for doing the call. I just wanted to ask, do you see a bigger role here for the Financial Stability Oversight Council? With all the stress that's showing up in different markets, do you see risks to financial stability rising? Do you think there are some activities that FSOC might want to crack down on? And are you confident that there aren't any nonbanks that are systemically important? CHAIR POWELL. FSOC is really something that the Treasury Secretary chairs. And it's a big group-it's got a lot of people. I think it serves a good purpose. But, you know, you should know that we are, of course, in regular contact with the other regulatory agencies, constantly talking about what's going on in markets. There's a lot of information and conversation on an ongoing basis there, I would say. So-and the same is true with our central bank contacts around the world. We're in ongoing contact with all the major central banks around the world, talking about what's going on. We're having group calls, we're calling one-on-one, so there's quite a lot of information being exchanged there. And then, your question was, nonbank SIFIs. You know, again, that's a judgment for the-that's a judgment for the FSOC. I-you know, I'm comfortable with the actions that we've taken, and if-if we do identify, you know, a systemically important nonbank institution, then we wouldn't hesitate to designate it, but-although I guess now we're working more on activities, but we do still have the power to designate institutions, so- MICHELLE SMITH. Okay- VICTORIA GUIDA. Financial stability risks-are those rising? CHAIR POWELL. I'm sorry, the question was- VICTORIA GUIDA. Are risks to financial stability rising, given all the stress that's happening in financial markets? CHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. I would say, you know, that's-that's something that happens when markets are as volatile as they are, when you're having these big market movements while markets are trying to understand what's going on. They're trying to reach a view on-in high uncertainty, and that's why you see lots and lots of volatility. I think there's more risk to financial stability in an era like-like that than there is when things are really placid, and, you know, we're going home at 4 o'clock and kind of bored over here. That's not the case right now. So, financial stability-I would say those-those risks do rise at a time of high volatility, particularly a time where we're presenting-presented with a challenge that is-is kind of unique, really-it's not something we've all done before. I also want to add, though, that, you know, we're strongly focused on financial stability. We monitor it carefully. We've built a very resilient financial system. The banks are highly capitalized, lots of liquidity, much better at understanding and managing their risks, their resilience to stress. So our financial stability focus-our focus on an event like this over the last 10 years will pay dividends, in the sense that you have a much more resilient financial system than you've had before. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to Market News. JEAN YUNG. Hi, this is Jean Yung. I wanted to ask, a few days ago the Open Market Desk expanded its term repo operations, but the take-up was a bit low. Is that-did you have any takeaway from that? Did that indicate to you that the repos were not working as you had envisioned it, or was there something else that you learned from that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. Yes, so we saw, and everyone saw, that liquidity had become very strained in Treasury and MBS markets, and we decided to offer very large quantities of term and overnight repo to address that. That makes it easier to finance the purchase of repos-sorry, of Treasuries and MBS. So we did that, and as you pointed out, the take-up was not as high as many had expected, and I did-we did learn something from that. We thought that was worth doing, and what we learned was that we needed to go direct here rather than trying to intermediate through the dealers. And so we realized at that point that we would need to actually purchase securities for our portfolio, so we did that on Friday. We bought-the next day, Friday, we went in and we bought across the curve, and we bought, I think, $37 billion worth of securities, and then we saw what happened with that. We saw that market function improved a little bit, but still it wasn't what we needed. And that's why we brought together the full FOMC and had our meeting this afternoon and announced these measures this evening, which are strong measures, with the broad support of the Committee to provide really substantial amounts of liquidity. And I-I think you can see us working through different solutions and-and finding the one that we think really will work and then acting quite vigorously, quite aggressively tonight to implement it. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we're going to go to Reuters for the last question. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Two things, if I could. Could you describe any discussions you've had in coordination with the major banks-this whole talk of drawing down liquidity, drawing down capital buffers-how far can they draw it down? How much do you think they can put out-out to customer finance? Did you get explicit agreements for them that this will go to customer finance and not something else? And then, secondly, is there any discussion yet of-of using the 13(3) powers of the Fed to do some sort of direct lending facility? CHAIR POWELL. We have given broad general guidance to the banks. We'd like them to use their buffers to provide-you know, to provide loans and-and also to work with their borrowers. As you can see, we're providing a lot of guidance to them across a wide range, and they're saying they have every intention of doing that. That's good to hear. And-so we'll see how that works out. There-there are a lot of discussions going on, and, you know, we hear the banks saying, that's exactly what they're going to do, so that's a good thing. You know, we're-of course, we've-we're-we have nothing to announce on-on 13(3) powers, but, you know, of course, we-that's part of our playbook in-you know, in any situation like this. So, as I said, we're-we're prepared to use our authorities as is appropriate to-you know, to support borrowing and lending in the economy, and, hence, to support the availability of credit to households and businesses. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna Smialek. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. You guys have cut rates to zero, you're buying up huge quantities of government debt-I guess the question is, what more can you realistically do to help the economy, and where do you see a need for Congress to step in? CHAIR POWELL. So let me say that we're-we're committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time. We're going to use them, as I mentioned, forcefully, proactively, and aggressively until we're confident that we're solidly on the road to recovery and also to assure that that recovery, when it comes, will be as robust as possible. As long as needed, we'll use them. And I would just say, we have a number of dimensions on which we can still provide support to the economy. As you know, our credit policies are not subject to a specific dollar limit. They can be expanded as appropriate, and we can do new ones. So we can continue to be part of the answer. Will there be a need to do more, though? I think the answer to that-that will be ""yes."" I would say, Congress has also reacted quite aggressively and strongly with the Cares Act and other laws-several other laws. And that's appropriate. With enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, we've seen an extraordinary, historically large reaction. But I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the-if the recovery is to be a robust one. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I want to follow up on Jeanna's question and ask, what specifically do you think elected officials should consider in order to help return or hasten a stronger return to full employment? And what policy tools did you discuss at your meeting today that might be used to stop a deflationary spiral? CHAIR POWELL. So let me-let me start-I'll take the questions in the order you-you gave them. So in terms of, if I can say, legislative priorities, we don't-we're not responsible for fiscal policy. Those will be decisions for Congress to make. But I would say that policies that protect workers, businesses, and households from avoidable insolvency, that keep businesses going so that they're able to produce goods and-and to either hold on to their employees or quickly rehire them, those are going to be key policies. They'll come with a hefty price tag, but we would come out of this event eventually with-with a stronger economy and with less long-run damage to the economy. So that's-that's a key thing that-that, really, Congress could do over time. In terms of what we can do, I mentioned, we have our-our credit facilities are-are wide open. We can do more on that front. In addition, you know, we've had-we've had extensive discussions, as I've mentioned-done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over-in coming months over a range of potential scenarios for the economy. We do think that our-our policy stance today is right where it should be for now. As you know, we cut rates to the effective lower bound, we-and we've said that we'll keep them there until we're confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our goals. With asset purchases, we're continuing to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. So we're doing those things, and I would say that we'll continue to use our tools as needs be. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, question-Steve Liesman with CNBC. I've got two questions here. First of all, why aren't you announcing or conducting a specific quantitative easing program? And-and maybe you could explain what the context is now of the purchases that will be made and the amounts that are to come. The second question I have is, are-is the Federal Reserve really taking enough risk to help households and businesses here, in that you just said that the programs that are out there may be best for those who are able to repay loans. But-so don't you have a series of programs essentially lending only to those able to repay, which is essentially helping those who may need it the least? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, let me say again, in terms of-of asset purchases and-and other measures, we-we do think our-our policy stance is appropriate now. We've had discussions, as I've mentioned, over time and done quite a bit of thinking about what we might do in the future. We think, for now, our policy stance is appropriate. We're not going to change it now. And we're really waiting to see more from the economy. There are a range of potential paths the economy could be on, and I think as-as the time approaches for-then we'll-you know, we'll address your first question, which is about asset purchases. So-but that's not something we're doing today. It's-it's something that we have talked about, and, you know, for now, we like our current policy stance. In terms of risk, so, you know, we operate under the laws that Congress passes. And there are a number of aspects under section 13(3), and you can see that they've permitted us to, I think, move very quickly and move into areas where we've never been before and do so quite aggressively. So I-I think we're going places and providing help in places where we never have, and I'm glad that we are. I think it's appropriate that we are. Nonetheless, these are lending powers. And if you read section 13(3) of the Dodd-Frank-or, the Federal Reserve Act, and I know you have, it does require that-that we be secured to our satisfaction, and-and we can't lend to insolvent companies. You know, it's clear these are lending powers, and we are-we are ultimately bound to-to implement the laws that Congress gives us. We-we do not make grants. We can't make grants. And I-the reason I raised that in my remarks is that I just want to be clear on that. We-you know, we can do what we can do, and we will do it to the absolute limit of those powers. We will-we'll keep at it. And you-I just want people to know that we'll-we will be at it with-with the legal authorities that we have until we get through this thing. We will keep using our authorities. But there are authorities that we don't have, and there may be a need for those authorities to be used as well as ours. MICHELLE SMITH. Heather Long. HEATHER LONG. Hi. Hi, Chair Powell, it's Heather Long from the Washington Post. I have two questions for you, both on timing. The first, do you plan to launch the Corporate Credit Facility and the Main Street lending facilities in May or early May? Anything you can give us-a sense on timing? And the second, in the statement, you referred today-the FOMC refers today to a lot of medium-term risks from the pandemic. That sounds like you all think this is going to be a long recovery-a long road to recovery. Can you give any more guidance on how you all see this recovery taking shape? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, in terms of those facilities, the corporate credit facilities are near being finalized and will be operating, I would say, soon-fairly soon. Main Street facility is-we're close to announcing-to issuing a new term sheet. As you know, we put out a term sheet for comment a while back, and we got a couple thousand comments. We've carefully studied them. We've tried to reflect those in what we're doing now. I think, with Main Street, there'll be at least a couple of different kinds of lending going on there. It-this is a broad area of the economy with many different kinds of credit needs, so we're going to keep at that for some time, I think, adding in sectors and lending products. So I think we'll be at-we'll probably be continuing to work and expand Main Street for some time, but it won't be done quite as quickly. But the first part of it, I think, will be done fairly quickly. In terms of our statement, so what we said was that we-I'll just read the sentence. It says: ""[The] ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term."" So the ""medium""-but what we meant by that, ""over the medium term""-so, obviously, what we're talking about is, you know, not right now, in the very near term. It's between now and the long term, so the next year or so. And I would point to a couple of-of risks to the outlook that-what we were thinking of. First is just the virus. How long will it take to get it under control? Will there be additional outbreaks? Will there be drugs that can either treat it or-or a vaccine of some kind? So there's-all of that is very much shrouded in uncertainty. The second issue-and this is a very substantial one-is just the possibility of-of damage to the productive capacity of the economy through a couple of channels. The first is just workers who-if one is unemployed for an extended period, that person can-can lose the skills that are needed, can lose touch with the labor force, and have difficulty restarting his or her career. So that's a-that's a feature of deep and long recessions, and that's something we've got to watch out for. Another is just businesses-you know, these thousands of great medium- and small-sized businesses that we have all over the country. They're worth so much more to the economy than the sum of their net assets. They contain-you know, they're job creators, they're really important. And if we see an unnecessary-unnecessary insolvencies, a wave of those, that could be damaging to the performance of the economy over time. So the good news is that we have policies, as I mentioned in my remarks-we have policies that can address those things, but not perfectly. So that's-that's another risk. The third thing I would point to is just the global dimension. This is a very global phenomenon, and you are-we're seeing economic data from around the globe which is very, very negative, and that, too, can weigh on U.S. economic performance over time. I-you know, I would say, just on the U.S.-on the U.S. economy, there are things you can say, one can say. The first is that, in the near term, we're going to see, you know, significant declines in economic activity, significant declines in employment, and increases in unemployment. We're going to see that as a consequence of the virus and the measures we're taking to protect ourselves from it. The next phases are more uncertain, highly uncertain, but we will go through a phase starting fairly soon where we begin to reopen the economy. And probably the economic activity will pick up as consumer spending picks up. Consumer spending, as I mentioned, has gone down quite a lot. It'll begin to pick up as people start to return to their normal patterns of spending. But the chances are that it won't go right back to where we were, because people will-until they're confident of-that the virus is well and truly under control, then they will be somewhat probably reluctant to-to undertake certain kinds of activity. So it may take some time for us to get back-it probably will take some time for us to get back to-you know, to a more normal level of unemployment and-and, ultimately, to maximum employment. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, James Politi. JAMES POLITI. Thanks, Chair Powell. You didn't firm up your guidance on-this is James Politi from the Financial Times-you didn't firm up your guidance on interest rates at this meeting. And given the risks that you just outlined, under what circumstances would you strengthen the Fed's commitment to keep rates at the lower bound? And is there any danger to delaying-delaying that plan? Then, on the credit facilities, what kind of demand are you expecting for the programs that were set up under the Cares Act, and are you expecting them to rapidly reach capacity like the PPP plan did? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So on the first, as I mentioned, you know, we moved very quickly, very aggressively. We were the first to return to the effective lower bound, where we are now. We got there essentially right away, and we think that's the right place to be. We think, if you look at surveys, you look at market pricing, the market expects us to-to be there for a good while, and that's appropriate. So, you know, it's not as though the market is pricing in a near-term liftoff or anything like that. And let me just say, we're going to not be in any hurry to withdraw these measures or to lift off. We're going to wait until we're-we're quite confident that the economy is-is well on the road to recovery. So we don't see-we see our current stance and our current guidance-and I would say the same thing about asset purchases-we see them as appropriate. I've-I've also mentioned now a couple times that we have done a lot of thinking about what monetary policy might look like over coming months, and that would, you know, depend on-on where we are in-in a range of potential economic scenarios. So we-we were thinking about that all the time, but right now, for now, we think our current stance is appropriate. So we made no change in it today. Second question was, how-so the thing about our facilities is, Treasury still has plenty of equity. So we've said that if-if demand for our facilities is greater than we've estimated, then we'll expand them. And we have the ability to do that. So it won't be the way the-the Paycheck Protection Program is, where there's a specific amount allocated-appropriated for it, and-and then there's no more money. That's-that will be unlikely to happen here unless we exhaust Treasury's equity, and we're a long way from doing that. The second thing I would say is-and you've all seen this-is when we announce these facilities-and I mentioned this in my remarks-it's not just the actual lending we do, it's the-we build confidence in the market. And private market participants come in. And many companies that would've had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the-the initial term sheet on-on these facilities. So that's a good thing. Companies are out there financing, they're out there raising liquidity. We haven't made any corporate loans to-in those facilities. We've made the short-term money market loans, but-we haven't made any of them. And yet there's a tremendous amount of financing going on, and that's a good thing. So we-for that reason, the ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict, because there is this announcement effect that really gets the market functioning again. Of course, we have to follow through, though. And we will follow through to validate that-that announcement effect. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Howard Schneider. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Oh, hi, Chair Powell, and thanks for doing this. I wanted to get your-a little more expansion on the timing of recovery and the-the connection between the health response. You said earlier, I think, that you thought the second half of the year could see a pretty robust rebound. Is that now out of the question? And do you think a steady recovery is really possible until a vaccine's developed, given the patchwork of measures we've seen taken around the states? Is that going to really lead us to a steady path out, absent a vaccine? CHAIR POWELL. You know, as you know, economic forecasts are always uncertain. Today they're unusually uncertain, and that's-that's really because so much of the performance of the economy depends on the path of the virus and the success of the measures we take to control it, our success in reopening the economy, and also the time it takes to develop new drugs. And our tools, the things that we do, don't affect any of those things. We're not experts on those things either, but what the experts tell us is that the outcomes are highly uncertain. So this is an unusual, new kind of uncertainty added on top of our-our regular uncertainty. But I-I will say, there-I think there are a few things that you can say about-about the path ahead. First, this time, now, is going to be a time of sharp contraction in economic activity, high unemployment. Personal consumption expenditures have declined sharply, business investment as well. Unemployment moved up. We're going to see economic data for the second quarter that's worse than any data we've seen for the economy. And they're a direct consequence of the disease and the measures that we're taking to protect ourselves from it. So then we will enter this new phase, and we-we're just beginning to maybe do that, where we will-formal measures that require social distancing will be rolled back gradually and at different paces in different parts of the country. And, in time, this-during this period, the economy will begin to recover. People will come out of their homes, start to spend again. We'll see unemployment go down, we'll see economic activity pick up. And, you know, when will that be? It's very hard to say. But let's just say, for this purpose, that it's in the third quarter. So, as I mentioned earlier, that-that could be a fairly, you know, a large increase. Given the-given the size of the fall, the increase could also be substantially large, although it's unlikely that it would bring us quickly, quickly all the way back to pre-crisis levels. Of course, this is the period as well that carries the risk of new outbreaks of the virus, something we really want to avoid. I think then, after that period, at some point you will have-you know, the kind of formal social-distancing measures will-will be gone, but you'll still be left with, probably, a level of caution on the part of people who will-who will worry and probably keep worrying for some-for some time. You would think that behavior will change as people gain confidence. So the-the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity. I think trying to be really precise about when that might happen and what the numbers might look like is-I think it's very tough to do that. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Steve Matthews. STEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Chairman Powell, you've noted a number of times over the last year that there's been a broadening out of job gains with marginalized workers, people who have been left out of the recovery over the 10-year period, finally making job gains, and-particularly minorities, but also many other workers. Do you worry that this recession is going to fall hardest on those workers who've struggled and just got job gains in the last year or two, and that it may take years from now before there are opportunities for them again? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. That's exactly what I worry about. So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are-tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum. And it tends to come down-come down faster as well, but it tends to go up faster and be much, much higher. And we were in a place-only two months ago, we were well into-beginning the second half of the 11th year is where we were, and every reason to think that it was ongoing. We were hearing from minority-low- and moderate-income and minority communities that this was the best labor market they'd seen in their lifetime. All the data supported that as well. And it is heartbreaking, frankly, to see that all threatened now. All the more need for our urgent response-and also that of Congress, which has been urgent and large-and to do what we can to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, which is what I-I mentioned earlier. This is an exogenous event that-you know, just, it happened to us. It wasn't because there was something wrong with the economy. And I think it is important that we do everything we can to avoid that longer-run damage and try to get back to where we were, because I do very much have that concern. I think everyone is suffering here, but I think those who are least able to-to bear it are the ones who are, you know, losing their jobs and losing their incomes and have little cushion to-you know, to protect them in times like that. So, yes, that's a very big concern. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, I'm Victoria Guida with Politico. The Paycheck Protection Program has experienced some logistical problems because of the speed at which all of this is happening. For the Main Street lending facilities, which will also work through banks, what lessons are you taking away from that? And then, more broadly, you know, you mentioned earlier this year that the federal debt was on an unsustainable path. And I was just wondering, for Republicans that are starting to get worried about how much fiscal spending they're having to do in this crisis, you know, whether that should be a concern for them. CHAIR POWELL. So a couple things. This is different from the PPP, the Paycheck Protection Program, in two ways. One is, these are not grants, these are loans. So I don't know that the demand will be quite as strong as-as it has been for the PPP. I don't know that. And the second thing is, we won't run out of money. You know, it's not a limited pot, so there won't be this incentive to try to get there first and that sort of thing. So I'm-I'm hopeful we-we will very much try to learn as much as possible from that facility and from all the other ones, too. We have a lot to learn here, so we'll certainly be trying to do that. In terms of fiscal concern, so I-you know, I'm-for many years, I've been, before the Fed, I have longtime been an advocate for the need for the United States to return to a sustainable path from a fiscal perspective at the federal level. We have not been on such a path for some time, which means-just means that the debt is growing faster than the economy. This is not the time to act on those concerns. This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to-to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer-run productive capacity of the economy as possible. The time will come again-and reasonably soon, I think-where we can-where we can think about a long-term way to get our fiscal house in order. And we absolutely need to do that. But this is not the time to be-in my personal view, this is not the time to-to let that concern, which is a very serious concern, but-to let that get in the way of us winning this battle, really. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Oh, yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. Now, given the amount of stimulus on the fiscal side and monetary policy side, how much weight do you give to finding a vaccine, from clearing that uncertainty you talked about around treatment and whatnot, for the Federal Reserve pulling back on some of the Fed's actions and raising the rates from the zero lower bound? Also, when does that Main Street lending facility get deployed? Because you talked about ""soon""-you know, some businesses are in need now. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. You know, so we don't-we're not in a position to make, you know, a reliable assessment of when a vaccine or a therapeutic drug would be ready, and so we're not going to set our policies based on-on our estimate of that. We're going to just provide the support that we can with the tools that we have, and we're going to keep doing that until-until the recovery's well under way. In terms of Main Street, so you know the story. We put out a term sheet, we got a lot of comments, we took those very much to heart. We've spent a great deal of time here. It's a challenging space, because it's many different kinds of borrowers-they have different needs, different sizes of companies. And so, we're-as I mentioned, we're very close to announcing a new term sheet, which will then become operative fairly quickly. My guess is, though, that we'll keep-we'll keep looking to add products and add different kinds of borrowers to that as we go. And we're-we're well aware of the importance of-of doing it as quickly as possible. We, here, you know, we're very much in touch with-with the urgency of that need. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Don Lee. DON LEE. Chair Powell, it's Don Lee from the L.A. Times. I just wanted to follow up on a question-the question on the labor market. I know you said that it's highly uncertain but, you know, there are analysts who think that we'll have very high unemployment until even the end of next year, as high as 9 percent. And, at this point, what-can you just talk a little bit more about what you see as the path of employment in the coming months and into next year? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So unemployment's going to go up to a high number in the second quarter-uncertain what the number will be. When-and that's because so much economic activity has been shuttered, really, as we take social-distancing measures. And the-so sometime fairly soon here, and probably gradually and at different paces at different parts of the country, we'll see the social-distancing measures rolled back. People will begin to spend more money. It's, really, consumer spending has fallen precipitously. And once that starts to happen, people will get hired back and unemployment will go back down. I don't think it'll get anywhere near the historically low levels that we had in-as recently as February, 3½ percent. I think it will take some time for that to happen, for us to get back to anything that resembles maximum employment. But, I mean, the main thing we want is, we want to get back on that road. We want to get that-that recovery going and get people back to work as fast as we can. Not faster than we can, but as fast as we can. The main thing is to get into that stage where the economy's healing, where we have the disease under control, where we don't, you know, take too much risk of-of second and third waves and that sort of thing, and get people back to work. And, you know, it's-again, the path of it is highly uncertain, but we will-we will be there with our tools, supporting the economy and supporting that recovery. MICHELLE SMITH. Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. After the financial crisis, banks were instructed to up their capital so they could weather an economic shock. What kind of steps do you think we need to take for the economy writ large to make it more resilient to this kind of shock? CHAIR POWELL. Can you just say that part-you're a little bit low volume. SCOTT HORSLEY. Yes. What kind of steps could we take to help the economy as a whole be more resilient to this kind of exogenous shock? CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's an extraordinary, extraordinary shock, unlike anything, certainly, that's happened in my lifetime. And a couple things come to mind. I-I think the time will come for a careful assessment of the answers to those questions. It's early to be asking them. We're still putting out the fire. We're still trying to win. And I think we'll be at that for a while. You know, but I'd point to a couple of directions. You know, we worked hard to strengthen the banks: much higher levels of capital, liquidity, far greater sense of what the risks are they're running and how to manage them. So the breakdowns that we've seen in market function have really been in the capital markets. And I don't-I wouldn't rush in with prudential regulation into the capital markets. But I think-and we did plenty of things-you know, triparty-you know, we did a lot of reform in the capital markets: money market reform, triparty repo reform, central clearing, all these important things. But there-there will no doubt be-with this-the size and force of this shock will no doubt reveal weaknesses in the financial architecture, and we'll have to go to work on those. I-I also think it-you know, it tells you the importance of-of getting your fiscal house in order. The U.S. really hadn't-really hadn't gotten back to where we needed to get on fiscal policy. And, you know, so we-we had an already high level of debt to GDP, and rising quickly, when this shock arrived. Now, we have the fiscal capacity to deal with it, I believe. But we will need to-ideally, you would go into an unexpected shock like this with a-with a much stronger fiscal-fiscal posture. MICHELLE SMITH. Mike McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, given the demand drop, demand shock, and the drop in oil prices, do you anticipate that we might see any kind of deflation, even for a very short period, that would require a Fed response? If we get a negative print on CPI or PCE, how should people think about that? And second question-there is a disconnect, it appears, between the markets and the economic outlook right now. And I know you said that this isn't the time to worry about moral hazard, but do you worry, with the size of stimulus that you and the Congress are putting into the economy, there could be financial stability problems as this goes along? CHAIR POWELL. In terms of inflation, we think that inflation is very closely and strongly related to inflation expectations. And during the Global Financial Crisis, there was a concern that we might see deflation, but it didn't happen. Inflation expect-inflation tended to move down a little bit, as it will when demand is weak. And-but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States. They have in other places in the world, though, over the past 25 years. There's been downward pressure on inflation, really, for several decades now. So, I would say, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored, then we shouldn't see deflation. And the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to maintaining 2 percent inflation over time. So we'll be there to work on that. I think you asked, really, about headline inflation. If-if low energy prices-very low energy prices were to-were to drop headline inflation negative, I-I would hope that people would see through that-and we'll be monitoring it very carefully-would see through it, though, and look to core, which is a better predictor of future inflation. So, needless to say, we'll be keeping very close track of that. In terms of the markets, you know, our-our concern is that they be working. We're not-we're not focused on the level of asset prices in particular, it's just-markets are trying to price in something that is so uncertain as to be unknowable, which is the path of this virus globally and its effect on the economy. And that's very, very hard to do. That's why you see volatility the way it's been, market reacting to-to things with a lot of volatility. But, you know, what we're trying to assure, really, is that the market is working. The market is assessing risks, lenders are lending, borrowers are borrowing, asset prices are moving in response to events. That's-that is really important for everybody, including-including, you know, the-the most vulnerable among us, because if-if markets stop working and credit stops flowing, then you see-that's when you see, you know, very sharp negative-even more negative economic outcomes. So I think our measures have-have supported market function pretty well. You know, we're going to stay very careful, carefully monitoring that. But I think it's been good to see markets working again. Particularly, the flow of credit in the economy has been a positive thing, as businesses have been able to build up their liquidity buffers and households have been able to be home-you know, people have been home, you know, concerned about their jobs, but they're not concerned about the financial system collapsing as they were in 2008 and '09. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Chris from the AP. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chair Powell. Chris Rugaber over at AP, thank you. I guess I had two questions. I wanted to start on the unemployment picture and nail down a little bit how you see-how you see things going from here. You did talk about potential loss of skills over time. So are you worried about structural changes in job markets that would keep unemployment high and, therefore, potentially beyond the ability of the Fed to do anything about, which is something that was debated, as you know, after the last recession, and then eventually, of course, the unemployment rate did go lower than people thought? Second question is just on the money from Treasury, the $454 billion. It sounds like you want to keep that in reserve for programs that have high demand, such as the Main Street program. Are you willing to use that to backstop, say, a program that is having more losses? I mean, you know, what's your tolerance for loss among that $454 billion? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of the labor market, the-the risk to-of damage to people's skills and their careers and their lives is a function of time to some extent. So the longer one is unemployed, the harder it gets, I think-and we've probably all seen this in our lives-the harder it is to get back into the workforce and get back to where you were, if you ever do get back to where you were. So, you know, longer and deeper downturns have had-have left more of a mark, generally, in that dimension with the labor force. And so that's why-as I mentioned, that's why the urgency in doing what we can to prevent that longer-run damage. It doesn't have to be that way. We won't be able to limit all of it, but we do have the tools to-to do what we can to-to keep people in touch with the labor force and working and also out of insolvency, too. It doesn't seem fair that people should lose everything they have, including their homes, over this. So, nonetheless, there will be some of that. But we do have some tools to ameliorate that. In terms of the-so in terms of the-the money, you know, the $454 billion, it's a couple things. First, the Treasury Secretary really has-has authority over that, right? And it stands in front of our losses. So, you know-but I do think we are-we're clearly moving into areas where there is more risk than there has been in the past. And that's okay. I think that's what we're supposed to do. This is-this is a very unusual time. And so-but in terms of the-of the way to think about that money, I think that's really a question for the Treasury Department. You know, we are-we set up the facilities, and we work very, very closely and successfully and collaboratively with the Treasury on this, but that-that particular aspect of it falls more to the Secretary. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I'm wondering what you would say to savers who are hurt by very low interest rates and maybe going into investments maybe in the stock market that aren't so great for them. And also, I'm wondering if you can give us any more of a clue as to how long you think we're going to have interest rates near zero. CHAIR POWELL. So we think that low interest rates affect the economy through a number of channels in a positive way. Lower interest rates support economic activity through channels that we-overall, through channels that we understand reasonably well. They make it cheaper to borrow, they make-they drive, you know, your costs of borrowing down. They do-they do raise asset prices, including the value of your home. If your saver owns a home or has a 401(k), your saver will benefit from that. But for people who are really, really just relying on their bank savings account earnings, this is-you know, that's-that's-you're not going to benefit from low interest rates. But we-you know, we have to look out for the overall economy. Low interest rates support employment, they support economic activity, and those are our mandates. And I think for the overall good of the economy, low interest rates are a good thing. And that's not to say they're good for every single person, but that shouldn't stop us from doing what we think is-is good for the whole. In terms of how low, I really don't want to speculate. You know, we will turn to questions like that soon enough. But the-in terms of how long we'll stay and under what conditions we'll stay at the effective lower bound, those are just exactly the things we're thinking about. Right now we like the place we are. We've said that we'll keep our rates where they are until we're confident that the economy has weathered the effects of the outbreak and is on track to achieve our-our goals. So that's where we are. We're leaving-we're not changing that guidance today, you know, but it'll be-that means we're going to be very patient. That means we're-we're not going to be in any hurry to move rates up. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. CHAIR POWELL. Thanks."

"MICHELLE SMITH. For the first question, Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Yes, hi. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. I want to ask about the economic projections, and I realize these are more of an educated guess at this point, but they suggest the Committee sees quite a large output gap over the next two years. And yet the Committee did not take any steps to date to-to reinforce your forward guidance. And so my questions are, first, what are you hoping to learn by waiting? Second, how might that change your response? And, third, how close is the Committee to reaching a decision on a-a more concrete forward guidance and whether yield caps might reinforce that guidance? CHAIR POWELL. So, first, I would say that we think that monetary policy today is currently well positioned to support the economy in this challenging time. If we didn't think that, of course, we would change our policy now. As you know, we-we lowered our policy rate very quickly, [more] quickly than others, to the effective lower bound. And we've said that we'll keep it there until the economy has weathered the effects of the virus and is on track to achieve our goals. You can see that in-in the dot plot, as I think you pointed out, that overwhelmingly, FOMC participants expect, as their baseline expectation, no rate increase at least through 2022. And if you look at surveys of more forecasters and market participants, financial market prices, et cetera, those also appropriately reflect a long spell with rates at the effective lower bound. So the first thing is, monetary policy is in a good place, and it's-that's well understood in the markets. Secondly, we've also taken strong measures to support the flow of credit in the economy, as I mentioned. And, third, we're continuing asset prices in coming months at-at a-at a relatively high level. So for all those reasons, we feel like policy is now in a good place. So as we look ahead, we see that the path for the-ahead for the economy is highly uncertain and continues to depend to a really significant degree on the path of the pandemic. So, at this meeting, what we did was, as I mentioned, we-we looked in some depth at forward guidance and asset purchases and looked carefully at those. We also received a briefing on the historical experience with yield curve control. And we'll continue those discussions in upcoming meetings and evaluate our stance and communications as more and portion-more-more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. I-I would just say, in terms of-of what we're looking for, we-we expect to get a better understanding of the economy's trajectory and, particularly, how we should best deploy those tools to achieve those goals. So that's really what we're looking to achieve, and, as you can see, we're-we're actively at work on that. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Next, Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I'm-I'm curious about your inflation forecasts, which are-are pretty low across the forecast horizon. I guess just given how low you see inflation being over the coming years, why is policy appropriate now, and why not just kind of throw everything you can-you know, everything and the kitchen sink at it currently? And I guess if you could just talk a little bit about what urgency you see in-in returning it back to that 2 percent target. CHAIR POWELL. Our current policy stance is appropriate. And remember, we're using-we're using our-our emergency 13(3) lending tools to an unprecedented extent. We have asset purchases, and we've now said that we won't go any lower than this, and-but-but that we're prepared to adjust as appropriate, and rates are at the effective lower bound. So we have all of our tools in-in use in a strong way. And so what we're-what we're waiting for is to-is to learn more. I-I think, actually, if you look at the May employment report, it's a pretty good-probably the biggest data surprise that anybody can remember. It's a pretty good illustration of just how uncertain these times are. The economy is reopening. We're going to learn a whole lot about the-the path of the economy in the next-in coming months. So that's really what we're-what we're looking for. In terms of inflation, you'll know that we-we had a 128-month expansion, and we never did quite get inflation back to 2 percent on a symmetric, sustained basis. We got close for the last couple of years, but we never did quite get there. So I think we have to be humble about our ability to move inflation up and particularly when unemployment is-is going to be above most estimates of the natural rate for-certainly above the median in our-in our-in our SEP well through the end of-past the end of 2022. So I do-I think we're in the right place now. We-we are looking carefully at what the-as we learn more and-and better understand the-the path of the economy, we will be assessing, what's the best way to deploy all of our tools to achieve our goals in the best possible way? And I'll-I'll just say again that we are-the-the May employment report, of course, was a-was a welcome surprise, very pleased. We hope we get many more like it. But I think we have to be honest. It's a-it's a long road. It's-it's, depending on how you count it, well more than 20 million people displaced in the labor market. It's going to take some time. And we are going to be deploying our tools-all of our tools, to their full extent, in pursuit of that-of those goals, however long it takes. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I understand how the Fed might react in the event things come out worse than expected. I think I don't understand how you might react if things come out better than expected-kind of a variant on these other questions. How firm is the commitment to lower interest rates? And if things end up better, do you stick with these low interest rates, as you-as you projected them? And-or is it specific points that you have in mind-for example, unemployment or inflation-that is animating where you might go? And what are those numbers that you're looking for that might cause you to change about the policy as it now is projected? CHAIR POWELL. I would start with-that's where I would start. I would say, you know, we were-we just had a period of unemployment, as you know, that was in the-well below 4 percent, hanging around 3½ percent, that lasted two years. And during that period of time, we saw a lot of great things happening in the labor market, things that we'd love to get back to. We didn't see any problems with price inflation. Price inflation didn't really react much. So, I would say, you know, we'd be looking to get inflation back up, and we-we'd be prepared to tolerate pretty low-welcome, in fact, not tolerate but welcome very low readings on-on unemployment just based on what we-what we saw in the last-in the last expansion. So, you know, we're-we're not thinking about raising rates. We're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates. So what we're thinking about is-is providing support for this economy. We do think this is going to take some time. I think most forecasters believe that. It would be great if-if we got a whole bunch more months of job creation like that. Not-notwithstanding that, as I mentioned, there are-there are just a lot of people that are unemployed. And it seems quite likely that there will be a significant group at the end of-even-even after a lot of strong job growth, that'll still be struggling to find jobs, and we'll still be providing strong accommodation for that. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you. James. JAMES POLITI. Thanks very much, Chair Powell. There have been plenty of comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s since the crisis began. I mean, is that scenario sort of got[ten] more dire as data comes out and we're looking at a more traditional and sudden recession? And are you at all concerned that the performance-the strong performance in the stock market in the last few weeks is disconnected from economic reality? CHAIR POWELL. I don't think that the-that the Great Depression is a good example or a likely outcome or a model for what's happening here at all. I really don't. And there-there are just so many fundamental differences. First, the government response has been so fast and so forceful. The origin was quite different. This was a very-an economy that was in a healthy place. Of course, every economy has longer-run challenges, not-and that-that includes our economy, notwithstanding that 50-year low in unemployment and the longest expansion in our history and every reason to think it could continue. So that's different from what was happening around the time of the Great-the Depression started. The financial system this time was in-was in-was in very good shape, much better capitalized. So, you know, it's just not the right model. I would say, we're learning. You know, every month that passes, we're seeing more, we're learning more. And I think particularly the next few months will be very important in learning what the-what the real story will be, because we'll see the-the significant incoming data about the opening of the economy-the reopening of the economy. You know-and I would say, assuming that the-that the-that the disease remains or becomes pretty much under control, I think that what you see is a-is a very weak second quarter, historically weak, and then an-an expansion that builds momentum over time. People will adjust, probably a little bit gradually, to some of the activities that would-that involve getting together in small-in large groups in close quarters. Those will be the harder parts of the economy to recover. But, ultimately, we do see a full recovery over time. And that's really what, you know, what I think I'm-I'm personally seeing. And you could see significant job growth in-in coming months as people return to their jobs, but you're still going to face probably an extended period where it will be difficult for many people to find work. And for-and that's what you see in-in-in, really, many, many forecasts at this point. That doesn't mean it's right, but that's sort of a-a broad expectation, certainly not the Depression forecast. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris from the Associated Press. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you for taking our questions. Well, in the projections you have-you didn't change the-the Fed policymakers didn't change their-the forecast for long-run unemployment, so that suggests that you-you know, the-that all of you so far don't see necessarily prospects for long-term damage. But still, what kind of data are you looking at here to gauge, you know, the potential for longer-term hits to the economy even as we have some of these-even as we have something like the May jobs report, you could still have, at the same time, people return from temporary layoffs, there could still be permanent job losses? So what kind of data are you looking at to gauge that potential impact, and what is-what is it telling us so far? CHAIR POWELL. Chris, this is a really important risk. And I think it's-it's not the risk for the next few months, but it's the risk over time of-of lasting damage to the-to these-you know, to the productive capacity of the United States, typically in two forms. One, through extended periods of unemployment, people lose contact with the labor force. They get out of touch with the skills and-that they need, and-and they have a hard time getting back in, and that drives that-that, you know, it's very damaging to people's lives and their working lives. And it also just lowers, in a way-it can-it can increase the-you know, the unemployment rate, but it can also lower the labor force participation rate, which is almost worse, in a way, to have people dropping out of the labor force where we need them in the-in the labor force working. The other piece of it is just businesses. You know, a shock like this that just comes in, it's like a natural disaster. You wouldn't want a lot of perfectly good businesses, particularly the smaller and medium-sized businesses that may not have a lot of resources to sustain them to-you know, to go out of business permanently in a situation like that-like this where, really, there was no reason for it. Of course, you know, businesses are going to go in and out. They're going to fail all the time, and that's a healthy thing in capitalism. That's something that has to happen. But this is different. This is a way-potentially-so those are the things we've been worried about. We didn't change. You-you're right, though. We didn't change our longer-run estimate of-of potential growth or of the unemployment rate. And that's-I would say, in my thinking, the reason I didn't change mine is that I still-I-I think we can avoid that or avoid much of that, most of that even. And-and we do that with measures that-that, you know, keep people in their homes; that-that support hiring; that support growth; that avoid unnecessary, avoidable business insolvencies. And that's all the things that we're trying to do. Basically, if you look at what's happened, as I mentioned, there's something-somewhere short of 25 million people have been displaced, even after the good May employment report. What we're trying to do is create an environment in which they have the best chance either to go back to their old job or to get a new job. That's-that's kind of the most important part of this exercise. And maybe these-it's probably hopeful at this point to say that-that we won't have longer-run damage to the economy, and these numbers won't change. So-but I think it's way too early to be-to be changing the longer run-see, these are-these are not meant to be short-run numbers. They're called-they're longer-run assessments, so I-I would-I have not changed mine, and I'm hopeful that-that I won't have to change it. MICHELLE SMITH. Heather Long. HEATHER LONG. Hi. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. I'm struggling with two things that I hope you can provide some clarity on. The first is the ongoing bond buying program. You say that it's needed to continue the smooth functioning of markets, but I guess most of us aren't really seeing a lot of instability in markets right now. So if you could kind of give us some clarity of what you're seeing that needs to continue to be smooth at that level and that pace. Second is, you know, you were just talking about Fed concerns about small and medium-sized companies going out of business during this. And, I guess, you know, the Main Street Lending Program still isn't running yet. When do you expect loans to start happening? And do you think the two-month delay has-has hurt the chances of some companies surviving? CHAIR POWELL. There have been gains in market function, although not fully back to where you would say they were, for example, in-in February, before the pandemic arrived. We don't take those gains for granted, though. This is a-this is a highly fluid situation, and we're-we're not taking those for granted. And, in addition, as I pointed out in my-in my statement, those purchases are clearly also supporting highly accommodative-or accommodative financial conditions, and that's-that's a good thing, so that's why we're doing that. Turning quickly to Main Street, so I would say that the thing-what we've done on Main Street, I think to a greater degree, is, we've listened to feedback. So we've been out repeatedly for feedback in trying to create a-a much more difficult product than, really, the other facilities. And I think this-this last set of changes we made have actually been very positive for the facility. I think it's going to be better able to achieve its goals, and, you know, so we've used the time well, I think. And that-we are now in the-in the-in the final run-up to starting the facility. What we did, as you saw earlier-I guess it's early this week or late, whenever we did it in the last few days-was we lowered the minimum loan size and we increased the maximum loan size. But, I think, even more importantly, we lengthened the maturity and we stretched out the repayment schedule significantly. So borrowers will get a-a two-year delay until they have to make any principal payments-repayments and a one-year delay on interest. So we had been hearing from both borrowers and lenders that these would be very helpful. We made the changes. We're putting them through the facility. The next step will be to register lenders. At that time, loans can begin to be made. Shortly after that, the facility itself will be up, and those facilities can be-those loans can be sold-95 percent of the loans. And it's 95 percent across the board now in the Main Street facility can be sold. So all of that should happen quickly now. And I do think this has-this has been a challenging project, but I think we've come to a-to a better place. And, by the way, we're-we're going to be prepared to adapt further, if we need to. And-and that's true of all of our facilities. These are unique. There's no-there's no playbook here. You-you have to draw this up and then try it out. And we've-we've been, you know, very willing to adapt and will continue to be. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Matt from Bloomberg. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hello, Chair Powell. This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News. I wanted to ask you about regulatory forbearance. There were some piecemeal forbearance measures put into place in various jurisdictions and also to a slice of the mortgage market to prevent banks from foreclosing on such debts amid the widespread financial hardships caused by the pandemic. And with many of those set to expire soon and many businesses and households still in dire financial straits, I'm wondering if any consideration is being given at the Fed to more comprehensive regulatory forbearance measures or other regulatory measures to prevent businesses from going under just because they can't meet those payments. There have, of course, been some tweaks to the Paycheck Protection Program on the fiscal side to address this, but I wanted to ask you about things you might be able to do on the regulatory side as well. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. We can-we can make changes to bank regulation and supervision. I don't know that we have the ability to make changes, for example, in mortgage payments, if that's what you're thinking of, or credit card payments. That's really-that's something that could be legislative, or it could just be what the-what the banks themselves are doing. There's been a tremendous amount of forbearance on the part of the banks, and I guess our role there would be to encourage it, but those are not decisions that we hold any legal authority to make, and we-by the way, we have encouraged those decisions. I hope that's responsive to your question. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Scott Horsley, NPR. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know you're loathe to weigh in too heavily on fiscal policy, but given your forecast for elevated unemployment rates, do you think it's important that Congress extend the $600 a week extra unemployment benefits? CHAIR POWELL. I think we try to keep our comments on fiscal policy at a high level, and I'll-I'll come to your specific question, but I would just say this: This is the biggest economic shock in the U.S. and in the world, really, in living memory. We went from the lowest level of employ-unemployment in 50 years to the highest level in close to 90 years, and we did it in two months. Extraordinary. And, appropriately, the response from fiscal authorities has been large, forceful, and very quick by-by the standards of these things. Roughly $3 trillion Congress has authorized, and that's benefiting households; laid-off workers; small, medium, and large businesses; hospitals; state and local governments-14 percent of GDP. It is-it's in a class by itself, in terms of both the size and the speed of it, and it's also pretty innovative. You know, the-both the PPP and the unemployment insurance are quite innovative in the American context, and there were difficulties in implementing it, but that's really a function of-of their novelty, I think. Those programs-by the way, let me add: The Fed also-we both innovated and acted forcefully, progressively, proactively, and aggressively as well. If you put those together, all of that is making a difference now. You look at the income data. The expanded unemployment insurance and also the stimulus checks have gone a long way to replacing lost income from-from job loss. I think you're seeing it in the job market data. Many are giving the PPP credit on that front and-and in keeping small businesses going. So it's-so far, it's a good response, and it's having-it's having a big effect. You-you get to-the question is, it's big-everyone can see that it's big. Is it going to be big enough? And that-that is the question. And-and the question for-for-the question that I've been concerned about, really, is this issue of longer-run damage to the economy. We're-we're-we're doing a fair job of getting through these first few months, more than a fair job. The question, though, is, that group of people who won't be able to go back to work quickly, what about them? And that could be many millions of people, you know, parts-who worked in parts of the economy that will be the slow ones to recover. And, you know, we want those people back in the labor force. We want them getting jobs. So-and-and they're going to need possibly-probably will need further support. So I will just say this: It's possible that we will need to do more, and it's possible that Congress will need to do more. In terms of the $600 unemployment insurance, I wouldn't-I wouldn't try to give Congress advice on the specifics of that. I-I know they're looking at-I mean, I-I know from both talking to people and-and reading the papers that they're looking at a whole bunch of different possible approaches going forward, and some of those seem kind of promising. So, you know, we're happy to give advice if people ask for it but-but probably not-not publicly. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. David Gura. DAVID GURA. Thank you, Chair Powell. I'm going to pick up on what Scott Horsley was asking just a moment ago. You have been studious about threading this needle in the interviews that you've given and speeches and the-the colloquy that's followed, not giving advice to Congress but indicating that there's likely to be a need for more fiscal stimulus or additional policy in the future. So I'm going to try a hypothetical here, and you can rebuff it if-if you want. But if you were to find yourself in a-in a senator's office suite, and he held up that May unemployment report, which you've described as unexpectedly positive and-and a welcome surprise, and if he or she said to you, ""Look, this is an indication that we can put on the breaks,"" I wonder what you would say. Your-your message throughout this crisis has been one of how unprecedented it is, about how much urgency there is in dealing with this. Indeed, we've seen that from the Federal Reserve. I wonder if you worry that that sense of urgency isn't being matched and-and what the consequences of that might be, if there's a fear that the Fed could be seen as a Cassandra here as we look at that unemployment report and then through the summer, and you have more and more politicians inclined just to wait and see what happens here in-in subsequent reports. And a quick second question, if I could. You've talked a lot about your fear of a second wave of this disease, and it strikes me, there's a-a difficulty here with definition. You've talked about us weathering this crisis and getting through this storm. It seems to me, as I listen to the chatter coming from the White House and from politicians and epidemiologists, there isn't agreement on what ""getting through this"" means. And you have an Administration now inclined to, if not direct, be content with states opening up their economies perhaps too early. How problematic is that from a policy perspective, not having agreement on what it means to have defeated this virus or gotten to a place where the economy can get through this? CHAIR POWELL. I can't offer any advice, but I will provide a little context for the-for-I want to be clear about the picture-one way to look at the picture, really, and that is this: You can-you can get at this by looking at, you know, the-the-the widest measure of unemployment, of labor market slack, if you will, is the U-6 measure. And the U-that's the-the one we look-talk about all the time is called U-3, by economists. And the-the one that has a much broader measurement of slack in the economy is U-6. So in-in-in U 6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent. That-that amounts to 22 million additional people who are-who've-who've lost work in the economy either by going to part time or something like that. So that's in the low 20s, and that's post the May employment report. You can get at it a different way. You can look at-at just the regular unemployment rate. You can take the 21 [million]-people who have-had-are listed as unemployed right now. You can add more on for the ones who were miscoded. You can also take those people who are suddenly out of the labor force. You put those together, and that has gone up by about 24 million. So those are two different measures of what's happened. So the question is, 20, 22, 24 million people-got to get them back to work. Somehow, we've got to all, as a country, get those people back to work. They didn't do anything wrong; this was a natural disaster, and I-I really-I do think the responses so far have been great. So that's the way I would think about it. And if-if you think we-I would just, in terms of the May employment report, it's-it's so nice to see. I mean, I think what people were thinking was that you'd start to get those back-to-work kind of numbers in June and July and August. Very few people saw them in May. I mean, almost no one saw that happening as early as mid-May, but it did. And so, you know, and we-we don't know fully what that means, whether it's just a timing change or whether it will prove to be much more than that. We'll-we're going to have to wait and see. It is a-as I mentioned earlier, it is clear evidence of just how uncertain things are, and-and how humble we have to be about our ability to-to really have confident predictions as opposed to just predictions. So, bottom line, I would just say, that-that-the key thing people need to understand is that there's just a lot of work to do in the labor market. We're going to stick with this and support that until the work is done. That you-you can-that is something we're going to do with all of our tools, and I think it may require Congress to help as well. It may, but that's going to be their decision. On-you also asked about the second wave. So we-you know, we have major responsibilities and powerful tools, but the decision about when to reopen the economy is one for elected officials at the state and local and federal level. And, you know, if they ask, we-we don't have any particular expertise here at the Fed in pandemics or coronaviruses or anything like that. We talk to experts, but-you know, so we don't have anything special to add on that. I would just say, it's-you know, it's kind of self evident, I think, that if a-if it happens, you know, the-the issue would be, first of all, people's health, but secondly, you could see a public loss of confidence in-in parts of the economy that will be already slow to recover. So it could hurt the recovery even if you don't have a national-level pandemic, just a-just a series of-of local ones, of local spikes could-could have the effect of undermining people's confidence in traveling, in restaurants and entertainment, anything that involves getting people together in small groups and feeding them or flying them around-those things could be hurt. So it would not be a positive development, and I'll just leave it at that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question. On Main Street lending facilities, you know, in May we saw 55-at least 55 companies file for bankruptcy. Do you think that it is too late, first of all? Second of all, the future of these facilities-is this a one-year impact to the economy through these facilities, or is this a multiple year? If so, how many years? CHAIR POWELL. We have, you know, significant interest, we think. And also, remember, lots and lots of companies are getting financed, too. The-the banks are lending. The markets are open. You know, you have a-a-a much better lending climate than-than certainly than we had in February and March. We don't think it's too late, though. We-we-and we do expect it to be up quite soon. In terms of the timing of these things, so, you know, we'll leave them open as-we'll leave them open for new loans as long as they need to. That'll be a decision we make, of course, with our colleagues at the Treasury Department. And, at a certain point, there won't be a need for further loans, and-and then the assets will-will be there. And so if that's-I don't know if that's a part of your question too, but I would just say that, at that point, you know, the-the useful role of the-of the Federal Reserve is probably close to an end at that point. We don't have any expertise in managing pools of credit assets, loans-if you will-or bonds, and we, you know, we don't want to be made-we don't really want to be part of the decisions that have to be made to manage such a portfolio, so we'd be looking to have that done either someplace else or, you know, by-by a third party or at the Treasury Department or something. And we're, you know, we're working on ideas for that. But our real focus now is on-is getting these facilities going and-and getting them to do the job that they-they need to do. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jonelle with Reuters. JONELLE MARTE. Thank you, Chair. So I have two quick questions. One is if we have hit bottom for the economy, and the second question is regarding the-the way that the pandemic has exacerbated racial inequality. I wanted to ask, to what extent do you think you can factor in both disparities when you're thinking about maximum employment? CHAIR POWELL. I would say that many forecasters had been expecting a bottom for the economy in-around the middle of the year, with-with a huge range of uncertainty. I think the labor market-the evidence of one jobs report is that the labor market may have hit bottom in May. We don't know that; we're going to see. And, you know, many forecasters widely expect a-a recovery over the second half of the year. So it-it is possible, but the thing is, we're not going to overreact to a single data point. We're going to be very careful about reaching any conclusions about-about good data or bad data. So, I think, you know, we're going to be here with our tools supporting this economy for as long as it's needed. So-but I think there's a possibility that-that the bottom has come in the labor market, but we don't know that yet. We'll-we'll know more as we go forward. So, in terms of the-you know, the effect of the pandemic on inequality, what you see- the pandemic, of course, hits everybody, but in an economic sense, it hits those industries that are-that involve groups of people in tight groups, either in places where they're-it's the travel, leisure, restaurant, bars, those kinds of service-economy jobs. And so a lot of the lost jobs were from people who work in the service economy, dealing with the public, for example, and relatively-compared to other jobs, relatively low wages. So, and if-if you just look at what that is, unemployment has gone up more for Hispanics, more for African Americans. And women have borne-borne an extraordinary-a notable share of the burden beyond their percentage in the workforce. So that's really-really, really unfortunate, because if you just go back two months, where we were was, we had, effectively, the first tight labor market in a quarter-century. And for the last couple of years before the pandemic hit, you were seeing wages go up the most for people at the lower end of the wage spectrum, and that was great. And, you know, we were meeting with people from low- and-low- and moderate-income communities all over the country and hearing, ""Don't change this. Do whatever you-do whatever you can. Keep this going. This is the best labor market we've seen."" And we had every expect-every expectation, every reason to expect that this would continue, and then this comes. So it's-it's heartbreaking, and, you know, we want to get it back, so-we really want to get it back. And so I think we learned a number of things over the course of the last few years. One of them is that, you know, I-you-you can have 3, 3½ percent unemployment for a couple of years, and, really, you see modest moves in wages and relatively almost invisible moves in inflation. So that was not anybody's understanding of the structure of the economy, I think, or most peoples', anyway. So we can use our tools to-to support the labor market and support the economy. We can-we can use them until we do fully recover, and that-that's what we're planning to do. You know, we don't target different groups. What-what we are-we are cognizant of the fact, though, that late in the last cycle, late in the last expansion, the benefits really do go more to people at the lower end of the wage spectrum for-for the first time in many years when labor markets are tight, when unemployment is low. And so we would really like to get back to that-get back to that place. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria from Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, I'm Victoria Guida with Politico. I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things that are-have already been asked. First of all, on fiscal policy, you all obviously put out your Summary of Economic Projections today, and I'm curious to what extent future fiscal policy is factored in or not factored in to those projections, and-and how, more or less, fiscal policy might affect those projections. And then my other question is on-on Main Street. You've mentioned multiple times that, you know, the Fed and Treasury are willing to expand the program further. So my question is, what's the threshold for those types of changes? Is it just making sure that borrowers that want to borrow through the program are-are-are able to do that? CHAIR POWELL. In terms of the way-the way we do forecasts is, we-we don't-the-we don't tend to incorporate things we're highly uncertain about. So I think the-the forecast would not have included substantial additional-you know, big additional fiscal support for the economy. Maybe-maybe a modest amount, something that looks like a-a low-end guess on what might come out of the current negotiations. That's basically what would be in the baseline. So, of course, if there were more fiscal support, you'd see-you'd see better results sooner, but that's a question for Congress. You know, we're-we're spending a lot, and that's really what they get to decide. In terms of Main Street and our willingness to expand it further, I think we're-one thing we're looking at-very strongly looking at is-is nonprofits, and is there a way to-to incorporate them into-into that facility or a similar facility. So that's another dimension. I-you know, if we had a great idea for changing Main Street, we would've done it. And we-and we have done some things that I think are really very positive lately here. But if we-as we learn more, it could be-it could be in terms of size, it could be in terms of lots of different things. But I-I think we have a good product to go to market with now, and I think it'll get-it'll get out there soon. And, you know, we'll see, and-and we'll be willing to continue to adapt. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Don Lee. DON LEE. Chair Powell, as you know, the vast majority of people who have been laid off are expecting to be recalled by their employers. At this point, what is your expectation of how much of these job losses will be permanent? CHAIR POWELL. I don't have a reliable estimate of that. Clearly, not everyone will go back. But-and I-I would say, many will go back, but what's-what's going to be the remainder when-you know, when we reach sort of what is the new normal? It's-it's so uncertain, but it-it could be a good number of millions of people, I think, in many-in many estimates, but these-I'd say you're so early in the process. People are-for example, people are going back and looking at other significant changes in the economy, and they've seen how many people go back when, for example, there's a technological change, and things like that-you may have seen some of this research-and you come up with an estimate. I-you know, it's just going to be very hard to say. I-I, but I-my-my assumption is that there will be a significant chunk-chunk well into the millions. I-I don't want to give you a number, because it's going to be a guess, but well, well into the millions of people who-who don't get to go back to their old job. And, in fact, there isn't a-there may not be a job in that industry for them for some time. There will eventually be, but it could be some years before we get back to those people finding jobs. I mean, when-when people lose a job, if they can find a job in their own industry, that's usually the fastest way, is-is they know other people in that industry, different kinds of jobs. That's usually the fastest. If you have to go to a different industry and start over again, it's much harder, and that's where you start to lose people's-who are-just fall out of the labor force. And-and, you know, it's very tough on their lives. We all know people who-to whom that happened in the Global Financial Crisis, and, hence, our desire to-to do what we can to support this and-and-and support this recovery with-with the tools that we have. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall-Genzer. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer, Marketplace. Chair Powell, I'm wondering-I want to go back to the issue of inequality, and I'm wondering, what more could the Fed do to reduce economic inequality in this country? I mean, I know that you said you don't target certain groups, but is there a way that you could use, for example, the black unemployment rate as-as some kind of a benchmark to something you'd want to meet or something that you'd keep track of? CHAIR POWELL. We do. We do track all unemployment by all kinds, as you know-all kinds of different demographics, including particularly the African American unemployment rate, which reached an all-time low since the data started being kept in the modern era. Of course, it's still close to twice the white unemployment-it is twice the unemployment rate, or it was back in the-back then. It's certainly much higher now. You know, the-the best thing we can do with our monetary policy tools is to-is to look at, you know, the evidence of what we saw-that we saw with our own eyes so recently, which is that the economy can have very low unemployment-very low unemployment. It could've been lower than we were. It could be lower than 3½ percent without seeing financial imbalances, without seeing inflation going-getting out of control. We, frankly, didn't even get inflation back up to target-without seeing wages getting out of touch with-with where they should be, so that's the-that's the biggest thing we can do. You know, in-in-inequality is something that's been with us increasingly for more than four decades, and it's-it's not really related to monetary policy. It's, or-or it's more related to-there are a lot of theories on-on what causes it, but it's been something that's more or less been going up consistently for more than four decades. And there are a lot of different theories, one of which is-just is that it-globalization-globalization and technology call for rising levels of skills and aptitudes and education, and that U.S. educational attainment kind of flattened out, certainly relative to our peers-flattened out over that period. And so a lot-so that means if you're-if you're on the right side of those trends, then those things are good for you. If you're not, then your wages are going to stagnate. And wages for the bottom, you know, 10 percent really haven't gone up in real terms in a very long time, and-over a long period of time, whereas wages for the people at the top, compensation, any way you cut it-before taxes, after taxes, after transfers, all of those, any way you cut it-wages have-compensation has gone up a whole lot for people at the top, and it really hasn't gone up for people at the bottom. If you look more in the middle, then it's-then-then it has gone up for most other groups, but at the bottom, not so much in real terms, in inflation-adjusted terms. So, you know, we-we call it out as a-as an important factor in the economy, and we will use our tools to support maximum employment and take that, you know, definition to heart. But, obviously, that's something that's going to require an all-of-society, all-of-government response. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we'll go to Michael McKee with Bloomberg TV. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio. I came across a statistic the other day that amazed me. Since your March 23 emergency announcement, every single stock in the S&P 500 has delivered a positive return. And I'm wondering, given the levels of the market right now, whether you or your colleagues feel there is a possible bubble blowing that could pop and set back the recovery significantly, or that we might see capital misallocation that will leave us worse off when this is over. Second, inequality is not just about wages, it's also about wealth. And a number of studies have suggested that by keeping rates low for so long and targeting the markets after the great financial crisis, that the Fed did contribute to wealth inequality in this country. And I'm wondering if you think there is some tweak or some message you could give that would affect that. CHAIR POWELL. What we've targeted is broader financial conditions. If you go back to the end of February and early March, you had-basically, the world markets realized at just about the same time-I remember that Monday-that there was going to be a global pandemic, and that this possibility that it would be contained in one province in China, for all practical purposes, was not going to happen. It all-it was-you know, it was Iran, Italy, Korea, and then it became clear in markets. From that point forward, investors everywhere in the world, for a period of weeks, wanted to sell everything that wasn't cash or a-a short-term Treasury instrument. They didn't want it to have any risk at all. And so what happened is, markets stopped working. They stopped working, and companies couldn't-couldn't borrow. They couldn't roll over their debt. People couldn't borrow. So that's-that's the kind of situation that can be very-financial turbulence and malfunction-a financial system that's not working can greatly amplify the negative effects of what was clearly going to be a major economic shock. So what our tools were-were put to work to do was to restore the markets to function. And I think, you know, some of that has really happened, as I-as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and that's a good thing. So we-we're not looking to achieve a particular level of any asset price. What we want is investors to be pricing in risk like markets are supposed to do. Borrowers are borrowing. Lenders are lending. We want the markets to be working. And, again, we're not looking to-to a particular level. I think our-our principal focus, though, is on-on the state of the economy and on the labor market and on inflation. Now, inflation, of course, is-is low, and we think it's very likely to remain low for some time, below our target. So, really, it's about getting the labor market back and getting it in shape. That's-that's been our major focus. And I would say, you know, we-if we were to hold back because-we would never do this, but-the idea that, just the concept that we would hold back because we think asset prices are too high-others may not think so, but we just decided that that's the case-what would happen to those people? You know, what would happen to the people that we're actually legally supposed to be serving? We're supposed to be pursuing maximum employment and stable prices, and that's what we're pursuing. We're also pursuing financial stability, but there you have a banking system that is so much better capitalized, so much stronger, better aware of its risks, better at managing its risks, more highly liquid. You have all of those things. And they've been lending. They've been taking in deposits. They've been a source of strength in this situation. So I would say that, you know, we're tightly focused on our real economy goals. And-and, again, not-we're not-we're not focused on moving asset prices in a particular direction at all. It's just we want markets to be working, and I think, partly as a result of what we've done, they-they are working. And, you know, we hope that continues. Thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. James Politi. JAMES POLITI. Hi there. James Politi with the Financial Times. Chair Powell, the Fed today decided to extend dollar liquidity swap lines with a number of central banks around the world. Why was that important for the Fed? And how concerned are you about dollar shortages persisting over time through the pandemic? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so our-our dollar swap lines-we introduced those back at the beginning of-of this episode after the pandemic made itself present. And dollar funding markets were in very difficult shape at the time. And the introduction of the swap lines has really restored dollar funding markets around the world to fairly normal levels of activity. And so they kind of served their purpose. But we extended them-I guess, yesterday morning-really to facilitate planning by other central banks and just so people will know that those facilities are still there. We want them to remain in place and be available as long as they are needed. And since, you know, the crisis and the economic fallout from-from the pandemic are far from over, we're going to leave those in place for the time being. And we'll leave them in place until we're confident that they're no longer needed. There's nothing that's going on in the market right now that raises any concerns. It's just, we want them to be there as a backstop for markets. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. I hope that you can hear me. Mr. Chairman, given-you've said several times now that you have lending, not spending, powers. Given that a lot of the capacity of these programs has not been used and, really, barely used, do you think that some of this money that has been dedicated by the Treasury to the Federal Reserve should be considered to be used by Congress as direct grants to businesses that are in need right now or to households, given that Congress is now saying that money is limited and they shouldn't take-they do not want to pass a very large stimulus bill? Is this money doing the best for the nation as a backstop for Federal Reserve programs that don't seem to be being used all that much right now? Thank you. And I have a follow-up, sir. CHAIR POWELL. So they-that-that's really a question for Congress. They-they appropriated that money, and-$454 billion for our facilities, and it's really a question for them. So you're right that our facilities have not-we haven't done as much lending as we thought. But, in very substantial measure, that's because markets started working again fairly soon after we announced the facilities, particularly in the corporate credit facilities, also in the muni-in the muni space, and also in the short-term funding facilities-the three of those that we set up. So we didn't turn out to need the kind of funding that we thought we would. On the other hand, it's important that the facilities stay in place, and that's why we extended them yesterday. It's important that they still stay in place until we're, you know, very confident that the turmoil from the pandemic and the economic fallout are behind us. So I-I can't really speak to what Congress should do with it, but it's important that the facilities be there and be fully funded in case the needs do arise down the road. We don't see them now, but, in case they do arise, they should be there. STEVE LIESMAN. Has any consideration-thank you. Has any consideration been given to asking Congress to allow the Federal Reserve to lend to companies in bankruptcy? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Not that I'm aware of, no. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nick Timiraos. [No response] Nick, are you there? [No response] UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER. [Aside] I didn't hear you say that. MICHELLE SMITH. We'll go to David Gura, NBC. DAVID GURA. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. No doubt you were paying attention when two of your predecessors were up on Capitol Hill just a few days ago answering some questions from-from lawmakers. And a question they each answered had to do with the continuation of these pandemic unemployment benefits. And something we've heard a lot is that they could be a disincentive to work. Both of them addressed that. I wonder if you would as well. And then, as a follow-up, I wonder what you've learned about the degree to which this has led to a widening of the wealth gap in this country, the degree to which maybe people are experiencing two different kinds of-of pandemics here. Some are getting through this based on what they've saved and the jobs that they have. Others are really struggling to get by. And I wonder what role-what additional role the Fed could have in, sort of, bridging that-that yawning gap. CHAIR POWELL. So, on your first question, I wouldn't want to be giving very detailed, specific advice on particular programs and the level they should be at and that kind of thing. I just will say the following, that, you know, this-this pandemic and its fallout really represents the biggest shock to the U.S. economy in living memory. We went from the lowest levels of unemployment we'd had in 50 years to the highest levels we've had in 90 years, and we did it in the space of two months. And I would say that the response from the fiscal authorities was strong, it was fast, it was broad-and appropriately so. And I think we are seeing the results of the earlier strong fiscal actions. When you see the spending that's happening, when you see small businesses staying in business even though the economy hasn't fully, successfully, sustainably reopened yet in many places, you are seeing what happens with that-that money. And so, in-in a broad sense, it's been well spent. It's kept people in their homes. It's kept businesses in business. And that's all a good thing. I think, in the broad scheme of things, that there will be a need both for more support from us and from more fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is up to Congress. You see the ongoing discussions that they're having. And it suggests to me that there's-you know, that both sides, they're wrangling over-over various provisions but nonetheless believe that there is a need for some additional fiscal support. And the last thing I'll say is that if the expansion-even if-sorry. Even if the reopening goes well and many, many people go back to work, it's still going to take a fairly long time for the parts of the economy that are-that involve lots of people getting together in close proximity. And that means that many of the people who were laid off from those industries-and that's restaurants, you know, bars, hotels, public entertainment, all of those places, travel and accommodation-many of those people are going to find it hard to go back-they can't go back to their old job. There won't be enough jobs for them. So I think those people are going to need support. I can't say what the exact level should be. It's not our role. But they're going to need support if they're to be able to pay their bills, to continue spending money, to remain in their current rental house or-or apartment or a house if they own it. So I think there will be a need. In terms of inequality, really-so I think it's fair to say that the burdens of the pandemic have fallen on, heavily-they've fallen on everyone, but they've fallen very heavily on people who work in the service industries in relatively low-paying jobs. So there was a-a figure that came out of some of our research that was that if you make $40,000 a year or less, then 40 percent-you had a 40 percent chance of losing your job in April and May. So it's falling very heavily on-on people who have the least financial wherewithal to, you know, to bear that. And that happens to be heavily skewed to minorities and to women. So that's just what the pandemic is doing. You know, in terms of what we're doing, what we're trying to do is create an environment in the financial markets and in the economy where those people have the best chance they can have to go back to work to their old job or to a new job. That's really what we're doing. Everything we do is directed at that. And, you know, the-I would say-I would say one last thing on inequality. That is, inequality is a-is an issue-has been a growing issue in our country and in our economy for four decades. And you see it-it has many faces. You see it in the relative flattening-out of-of incomes for people in low and-lower and middle incomes as compared to those at the top. You see it in low mobility where people-where the chances of moving up from the bottom to the middle or the top have declined and are lower than they are in other comparable wealthy countries. So it's a serious economic problem for the United States, but it's-it's got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic. Again, four decades of evidence suggests it's about globalization. It's about the flattening-out of educational attainment in the United States compared to our other competitor countries. It's about technology advancing, too. If you're on the wrong side of those forces, it's been-your income has stagnated. So it's-it's a critical, critical problem for our society, but one that really falls mainly to fiscal policy and other policies. Our part of it is to-is to push as hard as we can on our employment mandate while keeping price stability. We saw what happened to people at-at the lower end of the income spectrum late in the last expansion. It was the best labor market in 50 years, they told us. We saw that the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the-of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years of that 10 year, 8 month expansion. So a tight labor market is probably the best thing that the Fed can foster to-to go after that-that problem, which is a-a serious one. MICHELLE SMITH. And now, Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Yeah. [Inaudible] Journal. Chair Powell, you have described your asset purchase objective as stabilizing markets. And with markets having stabilized, aren't the asset purchases now doing more than address market function by supporting your macroeconomic objectives? The other question I have is, what is your strategy going to be with respect to using asset purchases to support your macroeconomic objectives going forward? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So you're right, the asset purchases in-in their current size really sprang from severe dysfunction in the Treasury and MBS markets at the beginning of the market reaction to the pandemic. And thanks to those purchases, we have substantially restored-not fully, but substantially restored functioning markets. This is absolutely critical. That market is really one of the-it's part of the absolute bedrock of the global financial markets, and it's-it's essential that it-that it work well, and it is doing so now. And we've always said, though, that we understand, accept, and are fine with the fact that-that those purchases are also fostering a more accommodative stance of monetary policy, which would tend to support macroeconomic outcomes. So it's doing both, and-and, you know, we've understood that for some time. It's not-the programs are not structured exactly like the-the QE programs were in the last-in the last financial-in the aftermath of the last financial crisis. Those were more focused on buying longer-run securities. The current purchases are all across the-the maturity spectrum. Nonetheless, they are supporting accommodative financial conditions. I think it's-it's clear that that's the case. In terms of our strategy, you know, that just remains to be seen. We-as you know, we've spent a lot of time in meetings this year looking at the tools that we have to adjust our current stance of policy. We do feel that our current monetary policy stance is the appropriate one. You know, we cut rates close to zero right at the beginning. We-we ramped up asset purchases, and those-those have really helped. And we gave forward guidance on-on both of those things, which the markets appear to understand, and market pricing is consistent with those. So we think we're-we think that our-our policy stance is a good one. We're, of course, prepared to adjust that stance as appropriate and when we deem it as appropriate to-to better foster achievement of our goals, of course. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking my question. You talked to Larry Fink at BlackRock in March, April, and May, according to your public calendars. I was wondering if you could tell us a little bit about what you talked about, and, if the topic of those conversations was the corporate credit facilities, how did you handle potential conflicts of interest during those conversations? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so-so BlackRock is just our agent. You know, we make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues, and they just execute our-our plans. I actually don't remember exactly what I would have been talking with him about, but he's a-you know, he's the head of a major service provider. He generally checks in to find out whether we're okay with the quality of the service that-that BlackRock is providing. I don't have the daily face-to-face interaction with anybody else at BlackRock or-or, as you can see, three phone calls in the course of a few months. It wasn't very many. So I think, you know, their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangements we have with them. And, again, I would have-I-I can't recall exactly what those conversations were, but they were-they would have been about what are you seeing in the markets and things like that too-you know, generally exchanging information. And he's-he's typically trying to make sure that-that we are getting good service from the company that he founded and leads. That's-I'd say that's his main objective when we talk. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you. We'll go to Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley from NPR. I wonder if you can give us an update on the coin shortage that you talked to lawmakers about last month and what, if anything, that tells us about the, sort of, economic circulatory system. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So-the situation with coins is that the-the quantity of coins is going up but was adequate before the pandemic. The problem is, the circulation kind of stopped because stores were closed, banks were closed. It just-customers weren't spending, they were-so the coins stopped moving in the system. So we've been working for-ever since that began to happen, we saw it happening right away. We've been working to try to-try to reverse that disruption of the supply chain and restore normal circulation for our coins. So we're working with the U.S. Mint, which is the issuing authority, to address the issue. Just last week, the Mint-you may have seen-issued a statement asking for the public's help in keeping coins circulating, and various people, you know, went and put their coins back into circulation. We also created a coin task force with all of the stakeholders-you know, banks and, you know, the armored carriers, the banking community, credit unions, everybody in the-in the coin supply chain. We're in frequent communication with the banks and with the-with the armored carriers trying to get back to where we need to be. So we do think the inventories are building up. You know, the Mint-the Mint is making coins as fast as they can, but-but, you know, things happen with-in the factory environment: Someone will come to work with COVID-I think this has happened in-in almost every factory environment around the country-and then they'll shut down for a day, and then they come back, and that kind of thing. So-so we're closely monitoring it. It's-you know, it's a significant issue. We've-we've got a lot of resources on it, and we do feel like we're-we're making progress. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you. Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can be a bit more specific about any risks that you see related to a double-dip recession or signs that the recovery was stalling, or maybe begin to stalling, compared to some of the signs that we were seeing earlier in the summer. Thanks very much. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So maybe I'll talk more broadly about the-the outlook and include your-include your question in it. So, as I mentioned, economic activity and employment picked up beginning in May and right through June and remained well below their levels because, I'd say, job gains have reversed about a third of the job losses from March and April, and consumer spending has reversed about a half of the drop. So-but, nonetheless, those were-those were sooner and stronger than we expected. So-but what happened then was, along with that positive data, we got-we got the virus increases starting in the middle of June in lots and lots of states around the country. And that brings us to a new-a new point here, which is, we need to-in addition to dealing with the health crisis-we have to remember, this is really a health crisis, and these are people who are having the coronavirus, and it's taking a terrible toll, so we've got to deal with the economic ramifications of that. So what we're seeing is that we monitor quite a lot of what we-what we think of as sort of nonstandard, high-frequency data. That's become a very important thing, even more important than usual in the work that we do. And what that data show, on balance, is that the pace of the recovery looks like it has slowed since the cases began that spike in June. So some measures of consumer spending based on credit card and debit card data have moved down. Recent labor market indicators point to a slowing in job growth, particularly among smaller businesses. Hotel occupancy rates have flattened out. People aren't going out to restaurants, bars, gas stations, pharmacies, and beauty salons as much. Consumer surveys, by the way, which had dropped very sharply when the pandemic arrived and then moved back up sharply-they look like they may be softening again now. There are still some areas of strength. Housing and motor vehicle sales have still been strong. Nonetheless, on balance, it looks like the data are pointing to a slowing in the pace of the recovery. But I want to stress, it's-it's too early to say both how large that is and how sustained it will be. We just don't know yet, because we have to wait for-to see the, you know, the actual data on spending and employment come in, and-but this-this is what we're seeing, and, of course, we're monitoring it very carefully. And I'd be remiss in not stressing this enough. The path of the economy is going to depend to a very high extent on the course of the virus and on the measures that we take to keep it in check. That is just a very fundamental fact about our economy right now. The two things are not in conflict. You know, social-distancing measures and fast reopening of the economy, they actually go together. They're not in competition with each other. So- MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Well, just to follow up on that a bit-and thanks for taking my question-you added the sentence into the statement about the course of the economy depends on the path of the virus. Is this-do you feel this idea, or this view, is not widely enough understood? Do you feel-you had warned back in May that too early reopening or an incautious reopening might harm the economy. Do you feel that message was not heard, and that some of these reopenings took place perhaps sooner than they should have? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think we feel that it-it might be, the most central fact or the most central driver of the path of the economy right now is the virus. And you're seeing that again now. You saw that in the-during the lockdown when we got cases way down, and you saw the economy reopening, and you saw spending go up and hiring go up. And now that the-that the cases have spiked again-again, the early data, the high-frequency data suggest that there is a slower pace of growth, at least for now. We don't know how deep or how long that will be. So it's such an important sentence. We just decided that it needed to be in our-in our postmeeting statement. It's so fundamental. And, you know, I think we can't say it enough. It's-it's really important. We're-you know, you can think of it as three stages. There's the lockdown, and we know what that looks like, and we'll get the data, I guess, later this week on GDP being down very historically large amounts. Then there was the reopening, and we would expect that many, many people would go back to work. Those whose jobs could be done without-you know, without exposure to lots of people in tight groups, they should have been-they should be able to go back to work during that phase fairly quickly. But that would depend on being able to keep the virus under control, which will depend on wearing masks and other social-distancing measures. So that's where we are. It's such an important factor. It's-it's in-we're all talking about it, so we thought it really had to be in the statement. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Mike McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, I'm wondering what it is-you've talked a lot about using all of your tools, and Governor Brainard talked about moving from support to accommodation-what it is you can actually do. You've lowered rates to zero. You've set up the lending programs. There hasn't been much take-up. And the tools you talk about are generally in service of keeping interest rates low, where they already are. So unless you were to go to negative interest rates, I'm wondering what additional accommodation the Fed can bring. Or is it really up to the fiscal authorities at this point to rescue the economy, to-to add additional help for it? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So you're right. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy at this difficult time, and we will always remain committed in that sense. We feel like we have ways to further support the economy certainly through our credit and liquidity facilities, which are effectively unlimited. We can adjust those programs. We also can adjust our forward guidance. We can adjust our asset purchases. So there are things that we can do. We-we feel like we have the ability to do more. But I would not disagree with the-with the importance of fiscal policy-with your statement about the importance of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy can do-can address things that we can't address. If there are particular groups that need help, that need direct monetary help-not a loan, but an actual grant as the PPP program showed-you can save a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs with those in a case where lending a company money might not be the right answer. The company might not want to take a loan out in order to pay workers who can't work because there's no business. So lending is a particular tool, and we're using it very aggressively. But fiscal policy is essential here, and I would say, again, Congress's action early in the pandemic-historically large by any standard around the world, and certainly by U.S. standards-it's really helping now. It's really helping. It's going to stand up very well to-to scrutiny down the years. This Congress's very fast and very open-handed response, I think, has really helped. And I think-I know that, as I've said, very likely more will be needed from-from all of us, and I see Congress negotiating now over-over a new package, and I think that's a good thing. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. So you talked about it several times today: The FOMC statement directly says the path of the economy is linked to the path of the virus. It looks like a vaccine might come this year, either in October or towards the end of the year. Has the Committee talked about how that might change Fed policies? And, as a follow, do you see a vaccine helping inflation get back to where you want it to be? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we-of course, the concept of vaccines comes up in our discussions. Of course it does. But I have to say, you know, we're-our job is not to plan for the upside case, right? The upside case-we've got that covered. Our job is to plan for all-the full range of things that could happen. And so we're assuming-we're going to continue to assume that our facilities are needed, that our policies are needed, and that the public needs-you know, needs the support that we're giving the public until-until shown otherwise. There's great uncertainty around the development of therapeutics and vaccines. All of us want them to happen as soon as possible, but we can't plan on that. We've got to hope for the worst-hope for the [laughs]-hope for the best and plan for the worst, I guess it goes. In terms of inflation, I don't know. I mean, I-you know, I think, fundamentally, this is a disinflationary shock. I know there-there is a lot of discussion about how this might lead to inflation over time, but, you know, we're-we're seeing disinflationary pressures around the world going into this. Now we see a big shock to demand, and we see core inflation dropping to 1 percent. And I do think for quite some time we're going to be struggling against disinflationary pressures rather than against inflationary pressures. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Ann Saphir. ANN SAPHIR. Hi. Yes, thanks for taking my question. So, I mean, as you monitor the rising infections and the slowing pace of the recovery, could you speak to, what would the trigger be for doing further easing? And on the flip side of that, when would it be reasonable to expect the Fed to consider raising rates again? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, as we've said, we're carefully monitoring the situation. We moved very quickly and very aggressively early, and we've been monitoring the situation. And I think the markets and-and the economy-you know, I think our policy is in a good place. But we've looked at-at ways of adapting our policy as time goes by, and we're ready to do that when we think it's appropriate. I can't give you a specific trigger. It really just is when we think it would help: Would it help more than what we're doing now to foster maximum employment and stable prices? Sorry, your second question was? [Inaudible] I can't hear you. Say it again? ANN SAPHIR. Sorry-for when it would be reasonable for the Fed to consider raising- CHAIR POWELL. Oh. ANN SAPHIR. -rates again. CHAIR POWELL. So as I-as I said earlier, or a while back, we're not even thinking about-thinking about raising rates. We're-we're totally focused on providing the economy the support that it will need. We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period. And we're absolutely committed to staying in this until-until we're very confident that that is no longer needed. So I wouldn't look for us to be sending signals about cutting back on facilities or anything like that for a very long time. We're-we're in this until-until we're well through it. And I think this-you know, I think the picture is, you have the-you have the lockdown, then you have the reopening. But there's probably going to be a long tail where a large number of people are struggling to get back to work because those-those heavily affected areas of the economy are going to be challenged, really, to employ the millions of people who are now out of work. I think 14 million people are now out of work who were working in February, something like that. So that's going to take a while, I think, in everyone's reckoning. And I just-everyone should know that we're going to be there for all of that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Catarina with Bloomberg. CATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair. Thanks for taking our questions. You mentioned earlier that the labor market we had in February was the best we've had in 50 years, yet at that point the Black unemployment rate was still double that of whites. So I wanted to ask you, you know, we've seen some economists and even the Biden campaign call for the Fed to more specifically target the gap between minority unemployment rates. Even if you don't get a mandate on this from Congress, is it something you would consider more explicitly going forward? And how would you do that? And then I also wanted to ask you about former economist Claudia Sahm's writings from last night. She gave a pretty harrowing account of her time at the Fed-described harassment and professional gaslighting that others have also spoken to. Is this your Federal Reserve? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So, first, on the unemployment, you're right. And we always point this out in our-in our remarks. While the aggregate unemployment rate was 3½ percent, every-every economy-every market in every economy has longer-run issues. And one of ours is just the disparate level of unemployment between-between Blacks and whites. And it's generally sort of twice as much-twice as high for Blacks. So even-but this was the lowest, you know, Black unemployment rate in 50 years-or, actually, since we started keeping records, which was less than 50 years ago. So that's just a fact, and it's-it's not a good fact, you know. So we have started, though, in recent years to focus considerable time and attention on disparate levels of unemployment-for example, among-among different racial groups and demographic groups. We regularly discuss those differences in our FOMC discussions. We call them out in testimony and in speeches and in our Monetary Policy Report to Congress. You'll see it everywhere, in all the things that we do. So what does that mean? I think-you know, I think what we learned is that a tight labor market really does a lot of good things for minorities and people at the lower end of the income spectrum generally. But it-you know, tight labor markets, it took 8 years-it took sort of the 8th and 9th and 10th years of that expansion to get to those benefits. So we need more than that. That's not a good strategy, waiting 8, 9, 10 years to get there. So we're-we're going to get back there as fast as we can, because that's what we can do, but society more broadly can affect these things. You know, we don't really have tools that can address distributional, disparate outcomes as well as fiscal policy. And just policy generally-education, health care, all those things are much better at doing that. In terms of-so we do-you will see that-you will see that discussed-the Black unemployment rate discussed all the time in what we do. And I think we clearly understand now that it's something to weigh when you get a tight labor market. It's something that you want to be focused on and weigh. So it is very much in our thinking-again, in a world where we don't really have the best tools to address that. So, something that we're doing. So I have not seen that-I did not see that blog post yet, although someone did mention it to me. We, of course, have been in meetings until just before this. So, but-and I will take a look at it. I will do that. And, you know, I-without having had a chance to think about it, read it, understand it, I'll just say a couple things. First, I think it's fair to acknowledge that there's been a lot of pain and injustice and unfair treatment that women have experienced in the workplace-not just among economists, but among economists and at the Fed. That's been going on for far too long. And, you know, like every other organization, the Fed could have done more and-and should have done more. I would say, though, that we-you know, we have made it a very high priority to have as diverse and inclusive an organization as we can. And I think we've made a lot of progress on that. I think we want a place where it's free to speak, where views are welcome, where people can disagree but must do so respectfully. I think a lot of organizations are coming around to understanding the importance of that. And I-my experience has been, you know, from my career in business too, is that organizations-the really successful organizations in our society get this. They do. They-mostly, they get it that if you want to attract the best people, this is what you-you're going to attract the best people by having a diverse and inclusive workforce, so-and workplace. So we've made diversity a priority. We actually-you know, this has been a big issue for the economics profession. We had the-the two heads of the AEA task force on this-who happen to be named Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen-come here, and I cohosted a-an event with them, I guess, last year or the year before, which had several hundred-500 people or something like that listening in about-about these issues. So we're doing a lot. I'm sure we can do more. We're doing a lot to-you know, to foster a respectful climate-particularly for women, but for-for all people. So it's-it's a very high priority for us as an organization. I will look into-into that and-when I-you know, when this is over. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you. Don Lee. DON LEE. Chair Powell, on the labor market, jobless claims rose again recently, and new hiring activity has weakened. I wonder, how big are the risks of the unemployment rate rising and job growth turning negative this summer? CHAIR POWELL. So as I mentioned earlier, you know, we're watching this high-frequency data. And, of course, the official labor market reports come out once a month, and no one has had a very good record lately of predicting what they're going to say. They've been, in May and June, stronger than anybody expected, particularly in May. So I would say, some humility is appropriate here in terms of thinking we understand exactly where this is going. I think all we can say today is that there's-there's evidence in the high-frequency data, the surveys, and, you know, you're tracking-you get pictures of spending. You get pictures of people's movements. And what we-it looks like we're seeing a slowdown in the rate of growth. That's-and that might be-it might be short lived, it might not be, you know. And it seems to be related to-and the timing of it seems to be related to the spike in cases that began in the middle of June. Now, I really don't want to get ahead of where the data are on this. So we're just going to have to see. We're going to have to-the data over the next couple of months will answer that question. And recent experience suggests we-we need to wait and see. In any case, there's clearly a risk that we're going to see a slowdown in the rate of growth in economic activity and in hiring. It might still be at a robust level. Honestly, we-we will not know until we start to see more data come in. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities. You all have used your emergency authority to buy assets that you can't directly buy, like corporate bonds, ETFs. So I was just wondering, what is the scope of your authority under 13(3)? What type of assets are you allowed to buy? Could you buy equities through an SPV, for example? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we haven't-we haven't looked at that, and we have no-no intention. We haven't done any work or thought about buying equities. But, you know, we-we're bound by the-by the provisions of 13(3), which requires that we make, you know, facilities-programs or facilities of broad applicability, meaning we have to have-it can't just be focused on one entity. You know, it has to be a broad group of entities. There's a lot in 13(3) about-about the solvency of the borrowers. You know, remember, it was rewritten or amended after the financial crisis, and it was written in a way that was-that was to-meant to make it challenging to bail out large financial institutions. That's-there was a lot in there to make sure that, you know, that they were going to be solvent and things like that. So, you know, we have to meet those requirements. You know, we haven't looked and said-tried to say, ""What can we buy?"" and, you know, ""Let's make a complete list."" You know, we felt that, using these facilities, that we could buy corporate bonds and-and municipal bonds, too. So- VICTORIA GUIDA. So I just-sorry, just to follow up really quickly. So is it-is it generally supposed to be primarily directed at debt instruments, since you talked about borrowers? CHAIR POWELL. The statute doesn't say that, but, yeah, you could read the statute that way if you want. Honestly, we haven't tried to push it to, you know, what's the theoretical limit of it. I mean, I think, clearly, it's-it's supposed to-it's supposed to replace lending, you know. That's-that's really what you're doing. You're stepping in to provide credit at times when the market has stopped functioning. That's fundamentally what you're doing with 13(3). And-and so I think you've got to-you've got to sort of work within that framework. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Can you hear me? Okay. One of the things in this crisis that's unusual is that companies are cutting wages and salaries, and that's something, you know, we haven't seen much. And I was wondering what the Fed is thinking about this. It-it seems to indicate that inflation could be more volatile in coming-coming months and coming years. CHAIR POWELL. Well, I-I think that the main thing that tells you is that the-the labor market has a long way to go to recover. You know, we had a good labor market. It wasn't perfect. There were always issues. There are always going to be issues within an economy. But the labor market really has a long way to go now. Even with two very strong months of job creation-7½ million jobs between the two months-we still have 14 million people unemployed. So it's just-it's a long way to go. And as-and that leads to a situation where there are so many people looking for jobs, and we have the economy only partially reopened. So there aren't, you know-until the economy-or as the economy fully reopens, people can go back to work, but-so it's a tough situation. And I've read reports of that. You know, of course, the reported wages went up because of the composition effect-you know, it's low-paid workers didn't go back to work, so-they were the ones that got laid off-so average hourly earnings went up. But clearly, clearly the pressure-there will not be much upward pressure on wages and compensation at the aggregate level here in a world where there are just an awful lot of people looking for work. And the main-so it just underscores again the-the urgency of doing everything we can to restore the labor force and-and to support those who are-who want to be in the labor force but whose jobs have gone away for some period of time as they find other work due to this natural disaster. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jean Yung. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about forward guidance. Do you see merits to tying your asset purchases to economic outcomes? And would you consider both inflation and labor market conditions as part of those outcomes? And specifically, for the labor market, what conditions would you want to see before you think about pulling back stimulus? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So that's a great discussion that we-we've talked about that at past meetings, and I imagine we will at future meetings and haven't made any decisions yet on that. But, you know, you've got a couple ways to go. You can tie-you can tie them to dates. You can say we will-for a specific period of time, we will keep rates at X level. Or you can say we'll keep them there until you achieve a certain macroeconomic goal. And it can either be inflation or it could be an employment goal, as you pointed out. And I think that, you know, there's attraction in all of those depending on the situation, I think, for obvious reasons. You can imagine situations where, you know, where you'd really want to be targeting macroeconomic outcomes. It's also the case, though, that sometimes-sometimes date-based guidance works too. I think it really is very fact specific, and it's not something we've-you know, we haven't made any decisions on that, so I wouldn't be standing here telling you we're going to go this way or that way, you know, should the time come for us to-to change our forward guidance. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah. HANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for doing this today. I wanted to ask, on the stimulus bill that Senate Republicans are considering, they've said that they're weighing whether to revise the Collins Amendment in order to ease the tier 1 leverage ratio for banks. Are you concerned that doing so will deplete bank capital, given that the Fed's stress tests showed that, under the most severe scenarios for economic recovery, that several banks would approach the regulatory minimum capital requirements? CHAIR POWELL. So-okay. So I think what the stress tests showed is that, under the ""regular way"" stress test, the banks passed. But right in the middle of the-of the stress test came the pandemic. And so we quickly dropped in three other scenarios, which were, you know, really bad scenarios. And many of the banks passed, but some didn't. So we-and that was done very quickly. So we pivoted, and we used the provision that says we can-that says there's been a material change, and we're going to ask them to resubmit their capital plans. We also stopped buybacks-share buybacks and limited dividends. So we're working through the details of how all of that will work. I think we're going to-I think we're going to send out the-the stress scenarios on September 30th. So, I would say, that's-you know, that-that process is working that way. And-but you're making a connection to it, to the Collins Amendment fix. So what's going on there is that, like many other supervisors and regulators around the world, what we found is that our-we have found our banks are strong. They're strongly capitalized, with lots of liquidity. And they've really been a source of strength in this-in this crisis so far. And they've written off bad loans and things like that. They're still well capitalized and strong and will be, I think, a source of strength in this situation. So-but what-what we did earlier was, we-what happens is, the banks run up against their leverage ratio, which is a non-risk-sensitive measure just of the amount of assets on the balance sheet. So people put cash in-on deposit at the banks, and they reached the limit of how-how much they could grow or made loans-you know, they-companies drew down loans and deposited cash. So we gave some leverage ratio relief earlier by temporarily-it's temporary relief-by eliminating, temporarily, Treasuries from the calculation of the-of the leverage ratio. This is a-this is another additional thing to do. If Congress chooses to do this, we would want it to be explicitly temporary. We-in other words, this will not be a permanent change in capital standards. We haven't decided to do it, but it would give us the ability to allow banks to grow their balance sheet and, in doing so, to serve their customers better. And, you know, I have to tell you, if you look around the world, bank regulators-many, many bank regulators around the world have given leverage ratio relief. You know, Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, the European Commission did, the Bank of Canada did, we did. It's-it's not, it's not-what it's doing is, it's allowing them to grow their balance sheet in a way that serves their customers. That-that's really what it's doing. And, again, I would want it to be explicitly temporary if-if we do do it. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, thank you. We'll go to Brian Cheung for the last question. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks so much. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I wanted to ask just how the framework review is working in tandem with your discussion on explicit forward guidance. So is the idea that you're trying to have some order to that, that you would announce the findings of the Fed review before then committing to some sort of explicit forward guidance or even yield curve control policy? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I do think that completion of the review would-first of all, it's something that was a very high priority for-we were really looking forward to completing it, probably, at the June meeting, but it might have been the meeting before that. We were right on track, and then we got distracted. I-and we weren't expecting the pandemic, of course. Nobody was. So the pandemic came in. I think it is important to go back and finish that, and I do think that will inform, you know, everything we do going forward. I would also tell you, though, that, to-to a very large extent, the-the changes we'll make to the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are really codifying the way we're already acting with our policies. To a large extent, we're already doing the things that are-that are in there. This is just a way of-of acknowledging that and putting them in the document. I can't tell you what the exact timing of that will be, but I do think that's a-that's a sensible way to think about it. Thanks very much. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos from the Wall Street Journal. You've been very clear about the Committee's intention on rates, not even thinking about thinking about raising rates, and today showing low rates even as unemployment falls to 4 percent and inflation rises to 2 percent. My question is about asset purchases. Does the guidance today apply to the current asset purchase pace? Are there any macroeconomic conditions under which you would favor increasing the monthly pace of Treasury and MBS purchases? And under what conditions would a decrease in the monthly pace of purchases be appropriate? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So we say in our postmeeting statement that we'll continue to increase our securities holdings ""at least at the current pace"" over coming months ""to sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions."" That latter part is an updating of our guidance to reflect what I've been saying in these press conferences for some time and what other central banks have acknowledged, which is that the purchases are fostering accommodative financial conditions as well. That amounts to roughly $80 billion a month of Treasuries and $40 billion net per month for MBS. So we do-we do think that these purchases have been effective in, in restoring orderly market conditions and have supported the flow of credit to households and businesses, including by fostering more accommodative financial conditions, which, of course, we think is a good thing. So, in terms of going forward, I would just say this: There are various ways and margins that we can adjust our tools going forward, and we'll continue to monitor developments. And we're prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate. NICK TIMIRAOS. If I could-if I could follow up, I suppose the question I have is, why give guidance on one policy tool but not give guidance on the other policy tool when the Fed has talked about those two policy tools working together? CHAIR POWELL. So we, we think our-we think our policy stance is appropriate today, and we're prepared to adjust it going forward as we, as we see appropriate. And today we believe that particularly this very strong forward guidance-very powerful forward guidance that we've announced today will provide strong support for the economy. Effectively, we're saying that rates will remain highly accommodative until the economy is far along in its recovery, and that, that should be a very powerful statement in supporting economic activity. Now we're buying $120 billion in securities per month across the-across the Treasury curve. That's also adding to accommodation. We do have the flexibility to adjust that tool and, and the rate tool and, and other tools as well. But as for right now, we think-we think that our policy setting is appropriate to support the expansion. We did-we said from the beginning that we would first try to provide some support and stability and relief in the first phase of the crisis, the acute phase, and then we would support the expansion when it came. Well, it's here. And it's well along. And so that's why we changed our guidance today, and we do have the flexibility to do more when we think it's appropriate. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking my question. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. I was wondering, you beefed up your language on financial stability in the long-run statement that you unveiled with your Jackson Hole speech last month. I'm wondering if you could kind of walk us through how you think about financial stability concerns as a factor in guiding and interpreting increases. You know, would financial stability concerns on their own be enough to merit changes in the fed funds rate? Or would they have to come in conjunction with an overheating on inflation or some sort of dramatic drop in the unemployment rate? If you could, sort of, give us an outline of your thinking there, please. CHAIR POWELL. So what we said in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was that the Committee's policy decisions reflect ""its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessment[s] of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals."" So that's what we said about financial stability. And today we said that we'd ""be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of our [the Committee's] goals."" But you asked specifically about, about financial stability. One thing I would say is that financial-that monetary policy should not be the first line of defense-is not the first line of defense on financial stability. We look to more appropriate tools in the first instance as a first line of defense, and those would be regulation, supervision, high capital, high liquidity, stress testing-all of those things, macroprudential tools. All of those things are, are really the first line of defense on financial stability. But we always leave open the idea that we will not ignore those kinds of risks and other kinds of risks, more broadly, that could impede the attainment of our goals in, in setting monetary policy. So that's, that's really how we think about it, but principally that, you know, other tools are the-are the frontline, as I mentioned. JEANNA SMIALEK. Just to follow up quickly, if, if other tools aren't forthcoming, would financial stability concerns in and of themselves be enough to warrant a rate hike? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, what we said again in the [Statement on] Longer-Run [Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy]-you know, in our consensus statement is that we, you know-""policy decisions reflect ... the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals."" So the test would be, you know, does a majority of the Committee feel that, that monetary policy is, is triggering that? And that, that would be-that would be the test. And, you know, it's not something that we've done. We do monitor financial stability concerns, of course, intensely and regularly. We try to use our other tools on them, but we, we do keep them in mind as we think about monetary policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you could help me understand how the projections of the Committee line up with the goals of the Committee. You've now altered the projections to-the statement to aim for inflation above 2 percent. But when I look at the SEP, I don't see the Committee believing a single year in the next four years that you are ever above 2 percent. In fact, for each year, you are below it until 2023, which is the first time that you actually hit 2 percent. So do you think-are, are you confident-is this just the Committee is not confident that not only can it not hit its 2 percent goal, but that now it can't hit its goal of being above 2 percent? CHAIR POWELL. Not at all. And, you know, you don't-you also don't see people, by and large, lifting off or raising interest rates above zero. I guess there are 4 exceptions out of a Committee of 17 during that-during the forecast period. So we don't reach 2 percent, but we get very close to it in the forecast. We reach 2 percent-I guess the median is 2 percent at the end of 2023. So, you know, you know what the guidance says. It says that we expect that the current setting of, of our rates will be-what we expect [is] that it will be appropriate until such time as we reach 2 percent inflation, that we feel that labor market conditions are consistent with our assessment of maximum employment, and that we're on track to achieve inflation moderate-inflation moderately above. So that's the test. So I don't think there's any conflict between those two because, you know, the, the way they're set up, the projections don't show the out years. You asked about confidence, and I would say that this, this very strong, very powerful guidance shows both our confidence and our determination. It shows our confidence that we can reach this goal and our determination to do so. STEVE LIESMAN. I'm sorry, if I could just follow up without being simplistic about this. But why wouldn't-if the Committee was confident that it could reach its new goal of aiming for inflation above 2 percent, why wouldn't one of those years at least show inflation being above 2 percent on the median forecast? CHAIR POWELL. Because it-we think, looking at everything we know about inflation dynamics in the United States and around the world over recent decades, we expect it will take some time. We expect that the economy will recover quickly now, but that that pace will slow as, as people go back to work. And we'll still have an area of the economy-a big area of the economy-that struggles. There will be slack in the economy. The economy will be below maximum employment, below full demand. And that will tend to wear-to put downward pressure on inflation. So we think that once we get up closer to maximum employment, we think that inflation will come back, generally. And, I mean, that's sort of what happened during the last long expansion. It's a slow process, but-but there is a process there. Inflation does move up over time. We do expect that will continue today, and we expect that our, our guidance is powerful and will help that outcome. We think that-that effectively saying that policy will remain highly accommodative until the economy is very far along in its recovery should provide strong support for the economy and get us there sooner rather than later. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask if you anticipate a slowing in the pace of the recovery if there is not another stimulus package and, specifically, if there are particular holes still remaining in the economy that you think could be helped by more aid from Congress. Thanks very much. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, first, if you look at the Summary of Economic Projections that my colleagues and I filed for this meeting, what you'll see is an expectation that the recovery will continue-that it will continue at a reasonable pace through 2021, '22, and '23. We do expect that that pace will slow just because you would expect that the, the pace would be fastest right at the beginning of the-right at the beginning of the recovery, because you had such a sharp decline. You would expect that the third quarter should be the fastest gains, and that, after that, the pace should slow down to a more normal pace. So we do expect that. In terms of fiscal policy-you asked about fiscal policy. So, you know, one thing-I guess I would start by saying that the initial response from fiscal authorities was rapid. It was forceful and pretty effective. And we're seeing the results of that in-today in income and household spending data, in the labor market data, in the construction data, in the data for business equipment spending, and the fact that businesses are staying in business, and, you know, the pace of default and things like that has really slowed. So there's been a really positive effect. That said, my sense is that more fiscal support is likely to be needed. Of course, the details of that are for Congress, not for the Fed. But I would just say, there are still roughly 11 million people still out of work due to the pandemic, and a good part of those people were working in industries that are likely to struggle. Those people may need additional, additional support as they try to find their way through what will be a difficult time for them. We've also got struggling small businesses, especially those in the business of facing directly to the public. And we have state and local governments dealing with a drop in revenue at the same time spending has gone up, much of it related to the pandemic and economic effects. So, again, I would say, the fiscal support has been essential in, in the good progress we see now. And, finally, I'll note that just about all-the overwhelming majority of, of private forecasters who, who project an ongoing recovery are assuming there will be substantial additional fiscal support. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Mike Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. [Inaudible] taking my question. Should we expect any further evolutions in forward guidance, say, maybe an adoption of something akin to the Evans rule that we had a few years ago? Or is there something else that the Fed might be considering in the future? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so we think that the forward guidance we adopted today is appropriate and, as I mentioned, powerful. Effectively, what it says is that we'll, we will keep policy where it is now-keep the rate policy where it is now until unemployment reaches the Committee's assessments or levels that are-sorry, not unemployment, labor market conditions reach levels that are consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation reaches 2 percent, and until it's on track to go above 2 percent moderately for some time. So that's very strong forward guidance, and we think that that will be durable guidance that will provide significant support to the economy in coming years. So that's, that's really our thinking on, on forward guidance on rates. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this. So to follow up on Mike's question there, since you described this guidance as durable, you-you've set up a three-part test here for rate hikes: levels consistent with assessments of maximum employment, inflation has risen to 2 percent, and you're on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. Each of these have modifiers, and I wonder if you could explain them a little bit more. How do we pin down assessments of maximum employment? When you say that ""inflation has risen to 2 percent,"" does that mean 2 percent for a day, a month, six months? And when you say ""on track to moderately exceed,"" how should we define ""moderately""? And how should we define ""for some time""? CHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, maximum employment is not-is not something that can be reduced to a number the way inflation can. It's a broad range of factors. It really always has been and, really, a substantial number of factors that we've indicated we would look at. So it's broader labor conditions, consistent with our Committee's assessment of maximum employment. So that would certainly mean low unemployment, it would mean high labor force participation, it would mean wages-it would be a whole range of things. And we're not looking at a rule. We're looking at a judgmental assessment, which I think we'll be very transparent about as we-as we go forward. In terms of inflation, you know, this is a Committee that is both confident and committed to-and determined to reach our goals. And the idea that we would look for the, the quickest way out is just-it's just not who we are. It's not that-there's no message of that here. We would not be looking for one month of 2 percent inflation; we said return to 2-to achieve 2 percent inflation. Okay. So just understand that, you know, we're strongly committed to achieving our goals and the overshoot. So that should tell you about that. Oh, in terms of-okay, in terms of-so, what does ""moderate"" mean? It means not large. It doesn't-it means not very high above 2 percent. It means moderate. I think that's a fairly well-understood word. In terms of-in terms of ""for a time,"" what it means is not permanently and not for a sustained period. You know, we're, we're resisting the urge to try to create some sort of a rule or a formula here. And I think the, the public will understand pretty well what we want. It's actually pretty straightforward. We want to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time. And if we do that, inflation expectations will be right at 2 percent, and that'll help us achieve 2 percent inflation over time and avoid the situation where the central bank loses its ability to support the economy. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi. JAMES POLITI. Thanks for taking the question. James Politi with the Financial Times. Do you consider today's enhanced forward guidance to have actual accommodation to the-to the U.S. economy from a monetary perspective and sort of deliver further support for the economy? Or is it just a tweak to your existing policy stance? And, in terms of fiscal support, do you assume in your own projections-not just, you know, private forecasters-that additional fiscal support will be forthcoming? Or do you expect weaker growth or a-or a larger contraction rather this year if no fiscal support is forthcoming? CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of the effects, so I think what we've done is-is more or less aligned with the consensus statement today. So it's, it's in line with what, what might have been expected. As I mentioned, I think over time it will provide very powerful support for this economy as we move forward. In a sense, it's consistent with expectations, so I don't-I'm not looking for a big reaction right now. But I think, over time, again, guidance that we expect to retain the current stance until the economy is-has moved very far toward our goals is a strong and powerful thing. And I think that will be supportive of the economy over time. In terms of additional fiscal support, I guess your question is, what would happen if-yes, so, people have different assessments, and, and different participants in the FOMC made different assessments on their own. I think broadly, though, there is an expectation among private forecasters and among FOMC participants that there will be some further fiscal action. And there does seem to be an appetite on the part of all the relevant players to doing something. The question is, how much and when? And so I would just say that if-and it's very hard to say. So, so far the economy has proven resilient to the-to the lapsing of the-to the, of the CARES Act unemployment-enhanced unemployment benefits. But there's, there's certainly a risk, though, that, that those who are unemployed have saved-appear to have saved some of those benefits, and they'll, they'll now spend them, and that, as the months pass, if, if there's no follow-up on that, if there isn't additional support and there isn't a job for the-some of those people who are, are from industries where, where it's going to be very hard to find new work, then you'll-that will start to show up in economic activity. It'll also show up in things like evictions and foreclosures and, and, you know, things that will scar and damage the economy. So that's a downside risk. So I, I think the real question is, is, when and how much and what will be the-what will be the contents? And, you know, no one-no one has any certainty around that, but, broadly speaking, if we don't get that, then there would certainly be downside risks through the-certainly through the channel I mentioned. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Anneken, CNN. ANNEKEN TAPPE. Thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, given the recent update to the policy framework and repeated calls for this in the Fed Listens events, is the Fed open to other measures of the economy, such as income inequality and affordability of housing? CHAIR POWELL. So we-you know, we monitor everything we think is important in the U.S. economy. And in that-in a broad sense, all of it goes into thinking about monetary policy. You mentioned inequality. So, you know, disparities in, in income and in financial well-being by various demographic and racial categories is something we monitor carefully. Inequality, which I would point to-it's a multifaceted thing. But I would point to the relative stagnation of incomes for people at the lower end of the income spectrum and also lower mobility. So those are things that hold back our economy. They are. The thing is, we don't really have the tools to address those. We, we have interest rates and bank supervision and financial stability policy and things like that, but we can't-we can't get at those things through our tools. When we lower the federal funds rate, that supports the economy across a broad range of, of people and activities, but we can't-we don't have the ability to target particular groups. Notwithstanding that, we, we do talk about it, because these are important features of our economy. And we-you know, I, I think those are-those distributional issues are, are issues that are really for our elected officials. And I would say, I take them seriously as holding back our economy. The productive capacity of the economy is limited when not everyone has the opportunity, has the educational background and, and the health care and all the things that you need to be an active participant in our workforce. So I think we can-if we want to have the, the highest potential output and the-and the best output for our economy, we need that prosperity to be very broadly spread in the longer run. And I-again, I would just say, the Fed-you know, we can talk about those things a lot. And in, in-when we think about maximum employment in particular, we do look at individual groups. So high unemployment in a particular racial group like African Americans when-you know, we would look at that as we think about whether we're really at maximum employment. We would look-we would look at that along with a lot of other data. So the answer is, we do look at all those things and, and do what we can with our tools. But, ultimately, these are issues for elected representatives. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes, thank you, Chairman Powell, for the question. I just wanted some clarity here. At what point do you think it's prudent to shift the bond purchases from market stability-as you had said, from the shorter-term maturities to more longer-term, more stimulus-related? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we think our-we think that our asset purchases are doing both the thing-both those things today. We think, clearly, there's been great progress, in terms of market function. If you remember, early in the spring when the acute phase of the pandemic hit, market function was very low. And it's improved rapidly and, and in many respects is, is in a good place now. We also, though, think that these asset purchases, which total $120 billion a month-you know, which is much larger than, for example, the last asset purchase program during the Global Financial Crisis and the recovery therefrom-we think that that's also providing accommodative financial conditions and supporting growth. And we think that's fine. We're also aware that we, we-there are ways we can adjust that, you know, to do various things-you know, make it smaller, make it larger, and also target different sectors of the-of the curve. And, you know, we're, we're going to continue to monitor developments, and we're prepared to adjust our plans as appropriate. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria. Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about a couple of things. First of all, if we don't get a vaccine until well into next year, what does that mean for the economy? And then, somewhat related, I was wondering if you could provide any more detail about the stress scenarios that you all are going to release for the big banks and whether that is going to be another full-blown stress test, whether we're going to publicly see those results, and what it might mean for bank payouts. CHAIR POWELL. Great. So, on the first one, what's happening is basically we're learning to live with-right now, we're learning to live with COVID, which still spreads. And we're learning to, to engage in economic activity. All of this recovery that we've seen is in a context where-you know, where people are still at risk of, of catching it, and yet we're able to resume lots and lots of economic activities. And that involves, as I mentioned, you know-I think the more social distancing we can preserve as we go back into the workforce-wearing masks, keeping our distance, that kind of thing-the better we'll be able to get economic activity back up close to where it was. I do think, though, there are areas of the economy that are just going to really struggle until we have an-a vaccine that's, that's in wide-you know, wide usage and is, is widely trusted. And those are the ones where people were getting really closely-close together. I also think testing-to the extent you have cheap and rapid testing, you can do a lot with that in the workforce. You can-you can build confidence in the workforce if you have regular-very regular testing that doesn't cost very much and you get the results really quickly. If you do that, you'll be able to open a lot of workforces, particularly in cities where the overall case numbers are quite low. And that will help a lot. So I think we're, we're going to be finding lots and lots of ways to get out towards-you know, as far as we can. There's always going to be that-for, for some time, there's going to be certain activities that will be-that will be hard to, to resume. So I, I think that's the only way I can say it. And I think trying to-you know, we all-when we make a forecast, we make assessments about that, but it's really hard to say. There is no template here. There's no-you know, there's no experience with this. So, frankly, for the last 60 days or so, the economy's recovered faster than expected. And that may continue or not. We just don't know. And I think we should do those things that we control to make sure that we can recover as quickly as possible. And the main thing, again, is wearing a mask and keeping your distance while you're in the workforce. That's something we can all do that will limit the spread and let people go back to work, avoid major outbreaks, and things like that. In, in terms of the stress tests, so I really don't have any-you know, we're getting ready quite soon to be making announcements and saying things publicly. There's not much I can say with you-nothing, really, that I can say that's-on that today. I don't have anything for you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Condon. CHRISTOPHER CONDON. Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, Chairman Powell. You have emphasized many times, including today, that the Fed can only lend and not spend, and sometimes the latter is what's really needed. But to the extent that a $600 billion lending program for small and midsize companies could help, what exactly is wrong with the design or function of the Main Street Lending Program, which has purchased just, I think, $1.4 billion in loans so far? Eric Rosengren at the Boston Fed has said recently that Congress should clarify how much risk it wants the program to take. But Congress has already appropriated substantial funds for the 13(3) programs, and these are funds that are explicitly designed to absorb losses. Meanwhile, my colleagues who cover the banking sector say they're being told by commercial banks that the Treasury Department is advising them to target zero losses-zero losses in Main Street Program loans. So, if I may, why is it that the Federal Reserve, the Congress, and the Treasury apparently cannot agree on a loss tolerance that should be applied to the Main Street Lending Program in a way that would allow badly needed credit to reach these companies? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, a couple things about Main Street. It, it reaches the whole nation. It's got more than half of the banking industry assets signed up among the banks that are part of it, and it's making loans. The number is more like-it's close to $2 billion now. So the numbers are going up. Banks are joining; borrowers are coming. And it's significant. It's, it's relatively small now, but it can scale up in response to economic conditions, should that be-should that be appropriate. You know, if you look out in the lending world, surveys generally find that, that firms are not citing credit constraints as a top problem. And that, that is a lot of PPP, bank credit lines, and syndicated loans. There's a lot of credit being let out there. So-but you're right. We, we are looking at some things. We're looking at-some lenders are concerned about the underwriting expectations. So banks are going to-their approach is likely to be that they're going to underwrite this loan roughly the same as they underwrite any loan. They're keeping part of it, and, you know, what, what we want to do is make sure that-that they know that they should take the payment deferrals and other things in, in place, and also that-you know, it's, it's really-it's really a, a facility for, for companies or borrowers that, that don't have access to, to ""regular way"" borrowing now. Otherwise, why would we need Main Street? So that's what we're working on. And we'll be doing some, some-we'll be making some changes in that respect. I don't-I saw what President Rosengren said. I, I can't really comment directly on that. I just would say that, you know, this is 13(3). If you look at the law under section 13(3), it's very clear that we are to make loans only to solvent borrowers. And, and the CARES Act is quite specific in keeping all of the terms of, of section 13(3) in effect, including the requirement that we, you know, gather good evidence that the borrower is solvent. This was-this law was amended in, you know, under-in Dodd-Frank, and the idea was, was to make it challenging and put hurdles in place before we made loans-at the time, the thinking was to banks. So now we-now we're using that same law for, for smaller business borrowers, and, you know, it doesn't-it's not a perfect fit. And, and, I would also just say, for many borrowers, they're in a situation where their business is still relatively shut down, and they won't be able to service a loan, and so they may need more fiscal support. Having said that, we're, we're continuing to work to, to improve Main Street, to make it more broadly available-make it pretty much to any company that needs it and that can service a loan. CHRISTOPHER CONDON. And can you just very briefly address the reports that the Treasury is advising banks to target zero losses? Is that appropriate? CHAIR POWELL. I can't say. I don't-I don't know about that. I haven't heard those reports. You know, again, if you think about it, we, we weren't-we're, we're going to have to go through the banking system to do this. We-we're not going to have a hundred thousand or a million loan officers working for the Fed and the Treasury. So we're going to go through the banking system, and the banks-banks like to make good loans. That's what they do. They're trained to make good loans. So you should expect that they-and we expect that they will do some underwriting. We also want them to take some risk, obviously, because that was the point of it. And the question is, how do you dial that in? It's, it's not an easy thing to do. And, you know, we're getting some loans made, and we're hopeful that we'll, that we'll clarify this and that credit will continue to flow. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, thanks for taking my question. Chair Powell, you've talked a couple of times about parts of the economy that may not recover as fast as we've seen so far. Presumably you're referring to airlines, hotels, other sections-you know, parts of the economy that rely on close contact. How are you thinking about that, in terms of its overall impact? Is that sector large enough to say keep unemployment above-you know, far above your maximum goals? Are you expecting that to come back with a vaccine? Or are a lot of those folks going to have to find, you know, new jobs in new industries? And should we expect the Fed will keep rates at zero until all of that reallocation is done? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes, we-of course, we can't be-we can't be really sure we know the answers to those questions. But I would say, the, the likely path is that the-that the expansion will continue. And it's, as I said, it's well along, and it'll move most easily through the parts of the economy-it'll still take some time, but the parts of the economy that weren't exactly directly affected, that didn't involve getting people in large groups together to feed them, to fly them around, to put them in hotels, do entertainment, things like that-those are going to be the places that are-that are very challenging. So there will also be the-you know, the places that are affected that way. And that's going to be challenging for, for some time. It just is. And we don't really know how long that will be. It's-you know, it's millions of people. As I mentioned, we had 11 million-something like 11 million people in the payroll survey have gone back to work out of 22 million who went-who lost their jobs in March and April. So that's half of them. So, 11 million-particularly if the pace of, of returning to work slows down, it's going to leave a large-a large group of people. And it'll be very meaningful from a macroeconomic standpoint. And our commitment is not to forget those people. As I mentioned, we want-you know, the sense of our forward guidance is that policy will remain, as we've said, highly accommodative until the-until the expansion is well along-really, very close to our goals. And even after, if we do lift off, we will keep policy accommodative until we actually have a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time. So those are powerful commitments that we think will, will support the full recovery, including those people, as long as it takes. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Mike McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Based on what you were just saying about keeping policy accommodative for a very long time into the recovery, lower-for-longer as far out as three years in your latest projections, is that basically it for the Fed? In other words, since interest rates are your main tool, the things you can do would push down on interest rates. But is it really-is it the case now that the only additional stimulus that can come to the economy is from the fiscal side? CHAIR POWELL. Well, no, I wouldn't-I certainly would not say that we're out of ammo. Not at all. So, first of all, we, we do have lots of tools. We've got the lending tools, we've got the balance sheet, and we've got further forward guidance-further forward guidance. So we, we-there's still plenty more that we can do. We do think that our-that our, our rate policy stance is an appropriate one to support the economy. We think it's powerful. And, as I mentioned, you know, this is the kind of guidance that will provide support for the economy over time, the idea being that policy will remain highly accommodative until the recovery is well along-really, very close to our goals-and then will remain accommodative even after we lift off. So I think that's, that's a really strong place for, for rate policy to be. But, again, we have the other margins that we can still use. So, no. Certainly, we're not out of ammo. MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I could follow up, in terms of the balance sheet, are you concerned that your actions are more likely to produce asset price inflation than goods-and-services inflation? In other words, are you risking a bubble on Wall Street? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so, of course we monitor financial conditions very carefully. These are-these are not new questions. These were questions that were very much in the air a decade ago and more when, when the Fed first started doing QE. And, I would say, if you look at the long experience of, you know, the 10-year, 8-month expansion, the longest in our recorded history, it included an awful lot of quantitative easing and low rates for 7 years. And, I would say, it was notable for the lack of the emergence of, of some sort of a financial bubble-a housing bubble or some kind of a bubble, the popping of which could threaten the expansion. That didn't happen. And, frankly, it hasn't really happened around the world since then. That doesn't mean that it won't happen, but-and so, of course, it's something that we monitor carefully. After the financial crisis, we started a new-a whole division of the Fed to focus on financial stability. We look at it in every-from every perspective. The FOMC gets briefed on a quarterly basis. At the Board here, we talk about it more or less on an ongoing basis, so it is something we monitor. But I don't know that the-that the connection between asset purchases and, and financial stability is a particularly tight one. So-but again, we won't be-we won't be just assuming that. We'll be checking carefully as we go. And, by the way, the kinds of tools that we would use to address those sorts of things are not really monetary policy. It would be more tools that strengthen the financial system. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Don Lee. DON LEE. Chair Powell, I'd like to ask you about the labor market. As you know, in August there were about 30 million persons claiming unemployment benefits. Yet the BLS jobs report for August showed about 13½ million unemployed, only about 6 million more than before the pandemic. I wonder how you reconcile that and what you think the actual labor market conditions are. CHAIR POWELL. So, I mean, I think the overall picture-take a step back from this. The overall picture is clear, and that is that the labor market has been recovering, but that it's a long way-a long way from maximum employment. I think that's, that's the bottom line on it. So, within that, though-take claims in particular. The number of claims, the quantity of claims, and, frankly, the fact that PUA claims are new-the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims-that's a new system that had to be set up. The actual counting of the claims is, is volatile, and, and it's very difficult to take much signal about the particular level. So, you know, because people were setting those systems up, and when they got them set up, they counted them all at once and things like that. I think, though, what you've seen is that the level of-certainly the level of initial claims has declined very sharply from the very high levels of March and April and is now at a lower level-continues either to be flat or gradually decline. It's worth noting-and that's good-it's worth noting that that level is maybe five times the level of what claims were. Claims were around 200,000; now they're 900,000, in that range, weekly for, for initial claims. So that just tells you, the labor market has improved, but it's a long, long way from maximum employment, and it will be some time getting back there. I think that's the best way to think about it. In many parts of the economy there's just a lot of disruption, and it's, it's really hard to say precisely where we are. I'll give you another example with-you know, we say unemployment's 8.4 percent. But if you count those who are-who are misidentified as, as employed when they're actually unemployed and you add back some part of the participation number-so if you were-if you had a job and you were in the labor force in February and you lost it because of the pandemic, some of you are now being reported as out of the labor force. But I-you know, I would-I would more look at those people as unemployed. If you add those back, the level of unemployment's probably 3 percent higher. On the other hand, by that metric, the, the unemployment rate would have been in the-in the 20s in, in April. So the improvement has been quite substantial under any measurement. But the level is still quite high. DON LEE. Well, if I could follow up, is-is it the Fed's aim to get back to 3.5 percent or even lower? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, absolutely. You know, I, I can't be precise about a particular number, but let me just say, there was a lot to like about 3½ percent unemployment. It's not a magic number. No one would say that number is the touchstone or that is, you know, maximum employment. I would just say, you asked about 3½ percent. A 3½ percent unemployment rate showed, you know, gains being shared very widely across the income spectrum-in fact, going more to people at the bottom end of the spectrum. It showed labor force participation coming up as-up above many estimates of its trend, as people who'd been out of the labor force were being pulled into a tight job market. There's a lot to like about a tough-a tight job market, particularly in a world where we didn't see inflation. So, yes, we'd love to get back to that. I mean, I would say, we would like to get back-rather than to a particular number, we'd like to get back to a strong labor market where wages are moving up, where people can find work, where labor force participation is holding up nicely. That's what we'd really love to get back to. Now, of course we would-we need inflation to perform in line with, with our framework. But the good news is, we think we can have quite low unemployment without raising troubling inflation. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall-Genzer. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I want to follow up on the wealth gap issue. I know you were-that you have limited tools. But are there things that you can do, possibly in the area of research and maybe expand your research on racial economic gaps? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we do-we are gifted with a, a substantial group of researchers who really cover the waterfront. And we do a significant amount of research on racial disparities in-across multiple variables, including wealth, as you asked about. So we do that. And we also-remember, we have our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs, which is present in communities around the country. And the Reserve Banks all have very active community affairs groups. They're present in communities around the country. So it wasn't just the Fed-Fed Listens events. It's more, just, over a long period of time we, we are in contact with people in those communities to understand their experience of the economy. We serve all Americans, and we know that. And we're going to use our tools to, to reflect that fact. So the answer is ""yes."" We do quite a bit of research, and I suppose we could do more, but we really do a lot. And we contribute to those fields and those assessments of, of the state of the economy. And we do that not just because it's interesting and important, but because it's important for the economy and important for our mandate. We are assigned ""maximum employment."" Now, what does that mean? As I mentioned earlier, it doesn't mean a particular headline unemployment number. What it means is maximum employment. So, you know, we look at-look at that in many, many different variables, and we ask ourselves whether those variables are-those labor market conditions are consistent with our assessments of what would constitute maximum employment. And that would include all of the things that we're talking about. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Thanks for this. I want to go back to the new forward guidance that you have. And you said that it's powerful, but you've already have two dissent-two dissenting voters on it. And I was wondering if there's other, other people who argued against it. And what do you say to the two who dissented? It looks like President Kashkari wanted a simpler forward guidance, and President Kaplan thought that the current guidance you have was fine for now. So, like, how did you argue back on those, on those arguments? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. I wouldn't-I don't want to comment particularly on, on the two dissenters, but they, they consent-they dissented from, of course, different perspectives, and, and that should be clear. That's their-they're not-they're sort of on, on two sides of the, of the discussion. But I would say this: I am blessed with having a Committee of highly thoughtful people who bring diverse life experiences and diverse careers, and, of course, diverse views to our work. And I wouldn't have it any other way. I wouldn't. So, so I would just say, the right-in our discussions the last couple of days, the whole Committee, everybody on the Committee is very supportive of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and what's in there-very, very broad support, unanimous support for that. Everyone sees the, the changes in the underlying economy and sees, in their own way, the need to address those-and including the changes we made to the employment mandate and to inflation so that we're now at flexible average inflation targeting. Of course, there would be-this is-you know, we're the first major central bank to adopt this framework. There's no cookbook, and we-you know, this is the first guidance under our new framework. So, of course there would be a wide range of views, and you would expect that. And it's actually a healthy thing. So I welcome that discussion. I would also say this: You know, this is all about credibility, and we understand perfectly that we have to earn credibility. This, this facility-this, this framework has to-we have to support it with our actions. And I think today is a very good first step in doing that. It is strong, powerful guidance. It is-it ties in very nicely with the Statement of [on] Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. We had quite a robust discussion, and there are, there are different ideas on how to do this, but I-that's just, that's just the way it is when you have a diverse group of highly thoughtful and effective people. And so I'm pleased with where it came out. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang. HANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about commercial real estate. I, I know you had mentioned before how you weren't sure if there was a way the Fed could support CRE borrowers. But I was just wondering if you had-if you've had any other continuing discussions on that and if there's any potential way that the Fed could step in in that area. CHAIR POWELL. So thank you for that question. You know, we've actually spent quite a bit of time on this as Secretary Mnuchin, I think, mentioned the other day. And I'll say just a couple things. First, you know, our facilities are essentially always-they have to be, under the law-broad based and not so much targeting any single sector. Also, it's important to remember that CRE, commercial real estate, benefits from several of our existing facilities. So the TALF takes commercial mortgage-backed securities and SBA commercial real estate deals. And the New York Fed purchases agency CMBSs directly. In addition, I would say, Main Street helps businesses pay their rent, you know. So we're, we're helping real estate, you know, in a number of other ways-commercial real estate. Also, CMBS issuance has resumed. Spreads have tightened on CMBS. There are a couple of issues. One is just that commercial properties with CMBS loans often have covenants-uniformly, I think, have covenants that forbid them to take on more debt. So you have a situation, and you have a situation where, where you-without a legal change or some kind of an innovation that defies discovery so far, you're-you have a hard time providing mass relief with regard to real estate that's in, in commercial mortgage-backed securities. So we're still working on it. We're still looking. I would say, it may be that further support for commercial real estate will require further action for Congress-from Congress. MICHELLE SMITH. For the last question, we'll go to Brian Cheung. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. So it seems like a lot of the new inflation framework is about shaping inflation expectations. But the average American who might be watching this might be confused as to why the Fed is overshooting inflation. So what's your explanation to Main Street, to average people what the Fed is trying to do here and what the outcome would be for those on Main Street? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. That's a very, very important question, and I actually spoke about that in my Jackson Hole remarks a couple weeks ago. It's not intuitive to people. It is intuitive that, that high inflation is a bad thing. It's less intuitive that inflation can be too low. And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that's too low will mean that interest rates are lower. There's an expectation of future inflation that's built into every interest rate, right? And to the extent inflation gets lower and lower and lower, interest rates get lower and lower. And then the Fed will have less room to cut rates to support the economy. And this isn't some idle, you know, academic theory. This is what's happening all over the world. If you, if you look at many, many large jurisdictions around the world, you are seeing that phenomenon. So we want inflation to be-we want it to be 2 percent, and we want it to average 2 percent. So if inflation averages 2 percent, the public will expect that, and that'll be what's built into interest rates. And that's just-that's all we want. So we're not looking to have high inflation. We just want inflation to average 2 percent. And that means that, you know, in a downturn, these days, what happens is, inflation, as has happened now-it moves down well below 2 percent. And that means that we've said for, for-we would like to see and we will conduct policies so that inflation moves, for some time, moderately above 2 percent. So it won't be-these won't be large overshoots, and they won't be permanent but to help anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent. So, yes, it's, it's a challenging concept for a lot of people. But, nonetheless, the economic importance of it is, is large. And, you know, those are the people we're serving, and, you know, we serve them best if we can actually achieve average 2 percent inflation, we believe. And that's why we changed our framework. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. CHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. It's Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks very much for taking my question. I'm wondering if you can speak specifically about what indicators you're seeing that suggest the pace of improvement has moderated, including in the labor market, and how correlated those indicators are to the recent rise in COVID cases that we've seen going into flu season. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, of course. Let's start with February. In February, we had an economy that was performing well. Then the pandemic hit, and we had a record decline in activity in March and April, and then we had a record bounceback in May and June. And so as I think would have been expected and was expected, the pace of improvement from May and June has now moderated, so it's not unexpected. And I think if you look at just about anything, you know, for example, the payroll readings, the payroll job gains in May and June were just outsized. And they're certainly still very large, but they've-but the pace of improvement has moderated. That's the case for, for all different measures in the labor force-in the labor market, rather. Another would be claims. Just about all the data were-showed a big bounceback. But then, as you would expect, when, when you sort of had people-a lot of people go back to work at once, the pace will moderate. Same thing with economic activity. Most forecasts call for, you know, still a significant growth in the fourth quarter but not at the 33 percent annualized pace that we had in the third quarter. So, in a sense, that would be-that would be as expected. We have been concerned that the downside risks, though, are, are prevalent now, which are-which are really the risk of the further spread of the disease and also the risk that, that households will run through the savings they've managed to accumulate on their balance sheet and that that could weigh on activity. But what we see up to the present, really, is, continued growth, continued expansion, but at, at a gradually moderating pace. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about where you think the stimulus package that is being debated in Congress is and how severe a threat that could be to the economy if it does not get passed, say, before January? CHAIR POWELL. So it is-obviously, it's for Congress to decide the timing, size, and components of further fiscal support for the economy, and I will say that the support provided by the CARES Act was absolutely essential in supporting the recovery that we've seen so far, which has generally exceeded expectations. And I do think it's likely that further support is likely to be needed for monetary policy and fiscal policy. I just mentioned the two risks that I think we, we face, and those would be well addressed through more fiscal policy. One is the further spread of the virus, and the other is the lapsing of the CARES Act benefits and the savings on people's balance sheets that will dwindle. But I, you know, I think it's appropriate for us not to try to prescribe for Congress exactly what they should do or what the timing of it should be or what the size of it should be and leave it at that. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. To follow on Marty's question, you really have been saying since April that more is needed on the fiscal policy front, and yet we don't seem to be that much closer than we were in the spring or the summer to additional spending. Two questions: Would the lack of fiscal support compel the Fed to provide additional accommodation, and are you and your colleagues being more vocal about the need for fiscal support because the capacity for monetary policy to support growth is diminished here, given the low level of short- and long-term rates? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So on your first question, you know, we'll take into account all external factors and, and do what we think we need to do with the tools that we have to pursue our goals. That's what we will do. And I've said it on a couple of occasions that that will go better and move more quickly if we have a broad set of policies from across the government. And we've said this in the very beginning: It's really, first and foremost, health-care policy, getting the-getting the spread of the virus under control and working on therapeutics and vaccines and that kind of thing, getting-so that-those are absolutely critical to the economy. Now, those are important, as well as health policies. They're, they're going to be critical to the economy. Fiscal policy can do what we can't, which is to replace lost incomes for people who are out of work through no fault of their own. And then we-what we can do is, we can obviously support financial stability through our lending programs, and, and we can support demand through, through interest rates and asset purchases and that sort of thing. So we're, we're going to take the economy as it comes, including all external factors. So I think all of us lived through the experience of the-of the years after the Global Financial Crisis. And for a number of years there, in the middle of the recovery, fiscal policy was pretty tight. And. and I think I just would say that I think we'll have a stronger recovery if we can just get at least some more fiscal support when it's appropriate, you know, when it's appropriate and in the size Congress thinks is appropriate. I do think that that will likely-and, by the way, you see, you know, a lot of discussion on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill that suggests generally that there will be something. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, also to follow up on sort of what Nick was talking about, two questions about quantitative easing. The first is, if the market is functioning better, as you and other Fed officials have said, and QE right now is designed for smooth market functioning, why haven't you reduced QE that you're doing if the market is functioning better already? The second question I have is, what good, for the broader economy, would additional QE do at this point, given that interest rates are already low and don't seem to be rising even above 1 percent? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, on the first-the first question, it's-our asset purchases are serving both purchases, both-sorry, both purposes: financial market function and support for economic activity. So-and that's really been true-I think in the very beginning of the crisis, the main focus was, obviously, financial, financial market function, particularly in, in, you know, some of the major markets. But after that period, we've, we've understood all along that our purchases are also supporting economic activity, and that's important. And that need hasn't dwindled at all. So, so we haven't looked at reducing purchases. So in terms of what they can do, first I would just say, the purchases that we have in place are providing strong support to economic activity still. And, by the way, they're sustaining the gains we've made in financial stability. You know, we don't-we don't take anything for granted. We, we don't expect that things will deteriorate. But, nonetheless, we have a habit of keeping things in place for a while. So we're not taking our gains in financial market function for granted, although, admittedly, they've been very large. So the asset purchases are just another very important piece of the accommodative policy stance that we have. And, you know, as you know, these-we're buying $120 billion a month. That's $1.44 trillion, if I remember my times tables. And it's just providing a lot of support for, for economic activity and, by the way, removing just about the same amount of duration risk from private hands as QE3 did. So this is a big program, and it's doing a lot of good. And we also, today, you know, we had a full discussion of the options around quantitative ease-not quantitative easing, the asset purchase program, and, you know, we understand the, the ways in which we can adjust the parameters of it to deliver more accommodation if it turns out to be appropriate. Right now, we think that this very large, effective program is delivering about the right amount of accommodation and support for the markets, and so it continues. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Craig Torres, Bloomberg. CRAIG TORRES. Hi, Chair Powell. First, it's great to see you're okay. Chair Powell, what is the risk that we come out of this with lower productivity; weaker labor force attachment; slower growth; and, important for your tools, Chair Powell, a cycle of lower real interest rates? And if you think this type of scarring is a risk, then I'm wondering, what's stopping the Federal Reserve from having a more explicit dialogue with Congress about the particular types of fiscal support we might need to avoid this outcome to make sure that you push away from the zero boundary or that the economy does when we exit this? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So you did-you laid out nicely the, the risks of damage to the supply side of the economy, or ""scarring,"" as you put it. And we've been talking about those since the very beginning of the pandemic. The risk is that, for example, people are out of the labor force for an extended period of time. They lose their attachment to the labor force, and it's harder to get back. Your skills atrophy. It's harder to get back in. And the record is, if you don't get back in very fairly quickly, it can be harder to get back in. And that holds down the whole economy. And, by the way, it also-it places enormous burdens on individuals who may have this happen to them at an important stage in their career. So it's, it's, it's important. And, you know-so that is one of the reasons why our response was so strong and so urgent at the beginning and why we called this, this set of risks out. I don't know how we could be much more vocal about it than we have been. Fortunately, for-you know, the economic recovery has exceeded, certainly, the downside cases that we were very concerned about and even, even exceeded-sort of exceeded the baseline expectations. Now, that's so far. We are a long way from our goals. And, you know, we're, we're sort of halfway there on the labor market recovery at best. And, and there are parts of the economy where it's going to be hard until there's a vaccine-you know, the parts of the economy. So, you know, that's the supply-side damage. That's sort of the third thing that we talk about. The first, at the beginning, it was to provide relief and comfort. The second-then the second part was to provide support when-to the expansion when it came. And the third was to avoid longer-run damage to the economy, and that's, that's all of these things. I think we have been vocal. You know, we'll, we'll try to continue to do that. And, and those are-that's again-that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long-term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way. It's, it's very important that-you know, there is a real threat here of those things, and, and, you know, we're trying to do everything we can to minimize that threat. MICHELLE SMITH. [Inaudible] JEANNA SMIALEK. [Inaudible] -look like and whether you anticipate any consequences if they are not extended? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, thanks. So, first, let me say, we do think that the facilities have, have generally served their purposes well, particularly in supporting the flow of credit, particularly acting as backstops to private markets. So, overall, we think that the, the programs have, have gone well. In terms of the extension, we are, we are just now turning to that question. You know, we've had a lot of things to work our way through. Right now we're just in the process of turning to that question and, of course, not made any decisions. And in terms of the process, this is a decision that, of course, we have to make and will make jointly with the Treasury Department. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. David Gura. DAVID GURA. [Inaudible] IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath wrote-Gita Gopinath wrote a piece this week in which she said, unequivocally, we're in a global liquidity trap and talked about the limits of monetary policy right now. She said, ""Fiscal policy will need to be the main game in town."" And it's been a busy week. I don't know if you were able to pick up the pink paper and read that piece, but she does say 97 percent of advanced economies have rates below 1 percent. And I just wonder if you'd agree with her, in principle, that we are in a global liquidity trap, and what the consequences of that would be. We've talked a lot about fiscal policy here domestically, and she talks about the need for sort of a global cohesive approach to, to fiscal policy. My second question is, you talk about how you follow the epidemiology. You're, you're looking [inaudible]. And I wanted to ask you about how you look at [inaudible] Christine Lagarde laying out what the ECB plans to do. As you lent an ear to what she had to say, the dire warnings that she was making this morning as she looks at the situation that Europe's in, what can you and your colleagues learn about the second wave or the third wave that you've talked about and, and we've all feared when it comes to a, a policy response? CHAIR POWELL. Okay, thanks. So two questions. First, I, I take the sense of your first question to be, is monetary policy out of power or out of ammo? And the answer to that would be ""no,"" I don't think that. I think-I think that we are strongly committed to using these powerful tools that we have to support the economy during this difficult time for as long as needed, and no one should have any doubt about that. And we do not doubt the power of the things that we've already done or the things that we may, may do in the future. I do think there's more that can be done. And I also think, if you look at the stock of assets that we've bought, if you look at the facilities and, and the way we've been able to keep accommodative financial-financial conditions accommodative, I think we've been able to do a lot of things that are providing very strong support for the economy. And we're going to-we're going to keep at that. I've said-we've said from the very beginning, though, that this is particular-that the particular situation we find ourselves in is one where there is a sudden loss of income on, on the part of millions and tens of millions of people. It's not so much a typical recession where demand weakens, the Fed cuts interest rates, interest rates stimulate demand, and the economy recovers. It's a sudden shock where tens of millions of people are out of work. And the fiscal response was, was frankly, I think, very good and very robust in the United States. And it's certainly one of the main reasons why the recovery has been as good as it's been so far. So I do think fiscal policy is absolutely essential here. You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there's a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy. And, of course, you need health-care policy too. I didn't see Madame Lagarde's comments this morning, but I, I took the sense of that question to be the spread of the disease in Europe, and what do we think about that? Yes. So, as I mentioned in my-in my opening remarks, it's a concern. We have a widespread spike in cases across the country, more in some regions than others. And even if we don't have-and I don't expect that we would-sort of government-imposed restrictions, it does seem likely, though, that people who have maybe begun to engage in activities that they had in flying, staying in a hotel, going to restaurants, going to bars, and, and things like that, that they may pull back in a situation where suddenly the cases are everywhere in your city, your state, your community. So I do think that that's a risk that we have as we go into the fall now and, and the cases spike. That, that could weigh on economic activity. One would expect that it would. We thought the same thing, in fairness, about the wave we had this summer in the South and the West. And the economy, you know, seemed to move right through that. This one seems to be larger and more widespread. In any case, it's a risk, is what I would characterize it-I would characterize it as a risk, as I did in my-in my comments. DAVID GURA. Can I ask a quick follow-up, just about the passions of the Fed Chairman? We've listened to your rhetoric over the course of this pandemic, and you talked about what the Fed was doing, the reasons for doing it at first. You talked about the balance between monetary and fiscal policy. I think in your recent comments and in Governor Brainard's comments, certainly, there's been more passion yet about the need for Congress to do more-I know that you're limited in what you can say or the degree to which you'd want to advise Congress, but a simple question: Do you feel that you're being heard? As you look at the prospects for this economy and potential need for more fiscal policy, do you feel like those who are crafting that policy, or could be, are listening to you and have a firm grasp of what you're saying about how that might affect or improve the economy going forward? CHAIR POWELL. So let me-let me say, in the first instance, our, our main focus is on doing our job, and that is really what we're, we're focused on is using the tools that Congress has given us and the assignment they've given us. And I think we're, we're-that is the thing that we think about night and day. I just know from, from the experience of the last cycle, it helps to have the whole government working on these things, and this one is particularly that way. And I, I don't-I think-you know, I, I don't want to say whether I feel like I'm being heard or not. But, sure, I think there are plenty of people on Capitol Hill who, on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the Hill, who see a need for further fiscal action and understand perfectly why that might be the case. DAVID GURA. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence, Fox Business. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. So what would cause the Federal Reserve to shift more of its asset purchases towards the long-term securities and Treasuries and change the amount of spending there also? And as a second point onto that, you know, would-if there's no fiscal stimulus package, would that then trigger buying of more long-term assets or change the asset purchases? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't really have a specific hypothetical I would-I would put to you. I would just say that we, we understand that there are a number of parameters that we have where we can shift the composition, the duration, you know, the size, the life, life cycle of the program. All of those things are, are available to us as ways to deliver addition-you know, more accommodation if we think that's appropriate. Right now, we, we like the amount of accommodation the program is, is delivering. And it will just depend on the-on the facts and circumstances. We may reach a view at some point that we need to do more on that front. Today's meeting was about analyzing the-one of the things it was about was about analyzing the various ways and having a, you know, good discussion about how to think about those, those various parameters, which I, I thought was quite a useful discussion. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about climate change. FHFA Director Mark Calabria recently said that financial regulators need to account for financial change-climate change, I'm sorry. What are you all thinking of doing on that front beyond what you're already doing, and do you have any plans for joining the network for greening the financial system? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I, I do think that the public, public will expect and has every right to expect that we-that in our oversight of the financial system, we will account for all material risks and try to protect the economy and the public from those risks. Climate change is, is one of those risks. It's a relatively-the science and art of incorporating climate change into our thinking about financial regulation is relatively new, as you know. And we are, you know, very actively, in the early stages of this, getting up to speed, working with our central bank colleagues and other colleagues around the world to try to think about how this can be part of our framework. And we're watching what other-what other countries are doing. We're active participants, as you know, in the CG-no, the greening the financial system. And, you know, we haven't, we hadn't actually formally joined, but we're there. We're in the working groups, and we're doing all of that. So we're very much working with and monitoring the things other central banks are doing. You hear-you know, there's lots of research going on at the various Reserve Banks and here at the Board in trying to understand this. These tend to be longer-term risks. But, of course, the longer term does arrive over time. And, you know, we take it as our obligation to-you know, to understand these risks and incorporate them into our-into the way we supervise and, and think about the, the overall financial system and the economy. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider, Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Quick follow-up from Gina's question: Have you gotten a commitment from Secretary Mnuchin to extend the 13(3) facilities if you decide it's necessary, and are you concerned what a lame-duck Trump Administration might do in that regard? And then, more broadly, on the state of the economy, are you comfortable now that the tail risk for worst-case outcomes has been kind of swept aside and minimized at this point? Are we down, in other words, to kind of household-level problems among a large set of households, perhaps, but that the financial crisis, double-dip recession sort of scenarios are, are off the table? CHAIR POWELL. So, on your first question, we, we really are just turning to this issue now, and we have not made any decisions. We, we are just getting started on it, and, and it's a decision that we'll make jointly with the Treasury Department. And that's, that's really all I can say today. That's all I have for you on that today. In terms of the tail risks, I mean, I think clearly the tail risks that we were worried about have, have subsided. And, you know, we were worried about very negative potential outcomes. And that-you know, that's, that's-what is to be expected of us is, is to think about how things can go wrong as well as the way things that can go right. But we, we have to-we do make policy from a risk-management standpoint. We don't just look at the most likely case. We, we ask, ""How do you make policy in light of the risks?"" and often it's downside risks in a situation like this. I would not say that anybody's feeling comfortable about this, though. You know, we've gotten through the first five, six months of the-of the expansion better than expected, but we do see in Europe-look what's happening in Europe, look what's happening here-another spike in cases as the cold weather arrives and people are inside more. So I think we have to be humble about where we are relative to this-to this disease. It hasn't gone away. Clearly, you know, therapeutics are advancing, research on vaccines are advancing, death rates are way down, hospitalization rates are, are lower now, but-so we're learning. But, I mean, we, we are so-we're very far from saying that we think we've got this and eliminated the tail risks. But I think, clearly, the tail risks have, have diminished since-at least our perception of them has diminished since earlier in the year. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Scott Horsley, NPR. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Earlier this summer, I know that you formed a task force to look at the distribution of coins around the System. I wonder if you can give us an update on how that's going. I know there's been some, some public relations effort. I think October was ""Get the Coins Moving"" month. Has that-has that problem subsided? CHAIR POWELL. So let me say why it's such an important-you know, in a world where so many payments are made digitally and all that, coins and currency are very important for the relatively low-income people. And so it's a really incredibly important part of the payment system, and we do pay a lot of attention to it. And I actually just-I just caught up this morning with the-with the person who heads that operation here who, who says that, yes, things have really gotten significantly better on the coin front. So we worked very hard to increase the supply of coins and, even more than that, the distribution of coins around the System and are happy to say that that situation is well on the way to normalizing itself. So very pleased to report that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi, FT. JAMES POLITI. Thanks very much for the-for the question, Chair Powell. We've just had a presidential election here in the United States. We still don't know who the winner is. Are you concerned that perhaps tensions or uncertainty over the outcome of the presidential election could pose a risk to the economic outlook or trigger market turmoil? And has the Fed had any discussions, either internally or with the Treasury Department, about responding to that, should it happen? CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So I'm very reluctant, as you will imagine, to comment on the election directly, indirectly, at all, other than just to say that it's a good time to take a step back and let the institutions of our democracy do their jobs. So, at the Fed here, we will, as always, continue to do our jobs. Every day we'll continue to serve the American people using our tools to support the economy during this difficult time. You know, the-you ask if we had discussions. I would say, you know, the meeting we just finished, for example, what we do is we talk about the economy and markets, domestically and around the world. We hear reports on how households and businesses are doing. We talk about risks to the outlook. We talk about what the right policy response might be. And the election comes up in some-you know, it comes up now and again, but it is not at all a central focus of the meeting. Not at all. So I, I'll just leave it at that. Again, very reluctant to get into anything more than that. Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Anneken, CNN. ANNEKEN TAPPE. Thank you for taking my question. Chairman Powell, can you tell us a little bit more about why the minimum loan size under the Main Street facility was reduced last week and why that was done now rather than earlier, seeing that small businesses are still-clearly still-struggling to make the change necessary? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, we have had very little demand below $1 million in loans. And part of that just is that the fee structure is what it is, and that's the compensation that the banks get. And there's a certain amount of work that they have to do to get-to get into the loan program and do-and to document the thing, the loans that they make because these are loans that, you know, go on their balance sheet. They keep 5 percent, so they actually have to underwrite the credit. And we're relying on them, to some extent, for, for doing that. And so we were reluctant. We moved the minimum down to $250,000, and we were reluctant to go below that. But we heard, over and over again, that it would be great if we could reduce it to $100,000. So-and, you know, we've been saying we'd have to redesign the program. And I, I got the question in a-in an oversight hearing a month or so ago with the Secretary and said that. And I went back to the office and thought, you know, okay, so what would that look like if we were to redesign the program in a way-what's the least thing we could do to redesign the program so that we could move to a lower level? And it-basically, we concluded we could just change the fee structure to create incentives for that, so we did that. We try to be responsive. We want, you know, qualifying businesses to be able to borrow. And we'll see how much demand will come. You know, with, with these programs, why did it-why didn't we do it right away? We tend to-it's-there's more work than one might-certainly than I imagined in setting up one of these facilities. And you, you just try to get it out there and get it working and not try to do everything before you start it because you'll never start it if you do that. Then you get it started, and you make changes. And we've been willing to make changes. That's the most recent set of ones that we've done. And, again, we hope-we hope that it will help some companies, and I guess we'll find out. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Heather. HEATHER SCOTT. Heather Scott this time, right? Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking the question. You say that you're-that you're not out of ammo. So I'm wondering, then, what is the next tool you expect to be able to roll out? Would you consider some sort of credit program for state and local businesses-state and local governments that are facing real budgetary pressures? CHAIR POWELL. So when I say we're not out of ammo, I'm looking at, you know, a couple of our tools, mainly. As I mentioned, the asset purchase program-there's a number of dimensions in which we can adjust that if we deem it to be appropriate. Right now, we like the job it's doing. We could, you know, if, if the facilities are extended, we could certainly look at new facilities. If-you know, if things deteriorate, that would be the case where you'd want to maybe continue the facilities and, and, and maybe change them and maybe have new ones. Who knows? But, certainly, the facilities have been doing a lot of work and been very successful, I think, overall in accomplishing that job. So I do think there, there are things that we can do. But, remember, we've always said this will take a whole of government approach, including health-care policy and fiscal policy too. So it really is, if you-if you want to get the economy back as quickly as possible to where we want it to be, then, then really it should be all of government working together. HEATHER SCOTT. If I could just follow up on that quickly. I mean, you spoke [inaudible] about the small business lending program. But that has only reached 400-there's only been 400 loans. When you say the programs are effective, do you not think there's more that can be done with another type of program or another redesign either for small businesses or for assisting state and local governments? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. There's a bunch of programs. I would say that the, you know, the corporate-the larger corporate market-based lending program has been very successful without making a single loan-I think, unambiguously, has been a big success. I think the success-I think the state and local government program has also restored market function so that-whereas, you know, there were the, the sort of individual investors who wind up funding loans in the muni market through. through mutual funds, they, they had withdrawn a lot of money, and, and that-we've had many weeks of consecutive, I believe, of, of inflows there, and you're largely back to a normal functioning market. I think that's also been a success. I think the other-certainly the, the funding market programs have been a big success. The-Main Street is just-is just a bigger challenge than all of them. Reaching out to small and medium-sized businesses through the banking system, which we had to do, is, is quite challenging. I do think, you know, the grant programs, the PPP, were, were a great way to reach smaller companies. You know, what you hear out there is that demand-you talk to banks, and they'll say demand for loans is very, very low right now. Companies are not borrowing. And, and the reason is that, you know, activity's at a relatively low level. They don't want to run up their debt. You know, so I-we put, we put an awful lot into Main Street, and it is very challenging to reach a lot of those companies. But I-you know, I think we, we are reaching many of them now, and, and I hope that the new changes will help us reach more. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Last question to Michael McKee, Bloomberg. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, there's a small but growing number of people, including some former Fed economists, who say you should find ways to go beyond your mandate to provide additional support to the economy, which, in essence, would be fiscal support, since it hasn't come from Congress. One of the suggestions is buying state and municipal securities directly. Another is perhaps following the BOE in increasing asset purchases to support additional fiscal programs or spending by the Treasury. Is there any circumstance under which you would consider those or those would be justified? How closely are you willing to work with Treasury? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I'm going to take your question literally. And so if the idea is money-financed fiscal policy, that's not something that we would consider. So that-what I mean by that is, is really, you know, the, the central bank is really funding fiscal activities of the government fairly directly. No, that's not something we do. We have different jobs. That separation between those jobs is absolutely critical in our system of government. The-you know, the job of taxation and spending goes to people who have stood for election and been elected, and that's the way it should be. There-they have to be responsible to the electorate. We have a specific, you know, job to do with, with a specific set of tools to support maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability, help the payment system, supervise banks-all the things we're assigned to do. But we, we, we're not going to get into financing the government and, and-by the way, when we buy government bonds, we don't-it doesn't actually, as you probably know, doesn't change the amount of government debt outstanding. We issue a reserve to, to purchase a Treasury security, and that's just another form-on the consolidated balance sheet of the federal government, that's just another obligation. You change the-you change the, you know, the nature of the obligation, but not the total quantity of debt that the government has when you do these asset purchase programs. So I don't know exactly what you're referring to. But, you know, to-again, to take your question literally about financing fiscal activity, it's really not something that we think the central bank should do and, and not something we're looking at. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up, there is a suggestion that you buy state and municipal securities directly in the same way that you buy mortgage-backed securities, providing, then, cash to municipalities that are cash-strapped at this point. CHAIR POWELL. Well, we're doing that with the Municipal Liquidity Facility now, so we're, we're buying, you know, with, with our own funds and with the CARES Act funds that, that we've gotten through Congress and the Treasury. We're buying municipal securities of up to three years. So we're doing that now as part of an emergency facility under section 13(3), you know, which has to meet the emergency requirements of exigent circumstances and which is all clearly laid out in the law. So we're, we're actually doing that now. But I, I see-what that is, from our standpoint, is a rare thing that we do under section 13(3) when regular intermediation in the capital markets or in the banking system has broken down. It's no longer working. So we step in under 13(3), and we provide liquidity. What turns out to happen is, we announce a program, and the market starts working. So we only actually have to do a backstop. The amount of financing that's happened in the municipal markets this year is much higher than it was the prior year, and, and we didn't do it. We did-we've done a very small number of, of loans. But just the fact that we're there as a backstop seems to-seems to get the private parties to get back together and, and get the market working again. So that's what 13(3) is for. We're not-that shouldn't be a permanent thing where we're just another federal financing agency that's available to direct credit to-you know, to very worthy borrowers. That would be more along the lines of a GSE. That's not what we do. We're there to provide emergency liquidity when intermediation has broken down and then to pull back on that when-you know, when-as the markets normalize, we pull back and we put those tools away, as we did after the Global Financial Crisis and as we will here when the time comes. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rich Miller. RICH MILLER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Michelle. I wonder if I could start with the, the SEP. We have-unemployment now is at 6.7, the SEP median sees, sees it falling to 5. Headline inflation is one time 1.2, the SEP median sees it rising to 1.8. And core inflation is 1.4, and the SEP sees it rising to 1.8 likewise. Would that constitute ""substantial further progress"" toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. Well, so we're not-we're not going to be identifying specific-associating that test with, with specific numbers at this point. So, really, the question is, what do we mean by, by that language? And, really, the overarching message, Rich, is that our guidance for both interest rates and asset purchases will keep monetary policy accommodative until our maximum-employment and price-stability goals are achieved, and that's, that's a powerful message. So ""substantial further progress"" means what it says. It means we'll be looking for employment to be substantially closer to assessments of its maximum level and inflation to be substantially closer to our 2 percent longer-run goal before we start making adjustments to our purchases. I would also point out that by increasing our asset holdings, we see ourselves as adding policy accommodation. There will come a time when the economy does not require increasing amounts of policy accommodation. And when that time comes-and that will be uncertain and, in any case, is, is some ways off. So I can't give you an exact set of numbers. We will-of course, as we approach that point, we'll be evaluating that. And when we see ourselves on a path to achieve that goal, then we will-we will say so undoubtedly well in advance of any time when we would actually consider gradually tapering the pace of purchases. RICH MILLER. Very quickly on, on that. You, you mentioned the next couple months are going to be very challenging. And regarding asset purchases, why not increase the duration of the asset purchases at this time, given what you see as a very challenging period ahead? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, again, I would start with what we actually did at the meeting, which, which was, we provided this, this guidance about the path of asset purchases. And I just went through what, what they-what they-the guidance that we put forward. And, you know, so I guess since September we've now adopted a flexible average inflation-targeting framework. We have provided rate guidance that is tightly linked to the goals as expressed in that new framework. And now we've done the same for, for asset purchases. So, you know, we've, we've been sort of-as, as the future has become clearer and as we've absorbed new developments in medical-in the medical sphere and also in, in the economy, we have-began to be able to see further. So we've, we've started to be able to provide further important guidance. And we think that the-that the asset purchase guidance, guidance is very important. We think that the, the prior language of ""in coming months"" was obviously temporary. This links that guidance, those purchases, to actual ""substantial further progress"" toward our, our mandated goals. We think that's important. And we think that that is important to have done. I, I would just add, though, that we also continue to think that our current policy stance is appropriate. We think it's providing a great deal of support for the economy. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. And, you know, we monitor a range of financial condition indexes. There are many of them, and they'll, they'll all pretty much tell you that. You can-you can also look at the interest sensitive parts of the economy-for example, housing, durable sales, vehicle sales-those parts of the economy are, are performing very, very well. The parts of the economy that are weak are the service-sector businesses that involve close contact. Those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the virus. And I'll close by, by just saying, we do have the flexibility to provide more accommodation through the channel you mentioned and through other channels. And we recognize that circumstances could shift in a way that warrants our, our doing that, including by adjusting purchases. We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the U.S. economy to achieve our goals. We will continue to use our tools to support the economy for as long as it takes until the job is well and truly done. No one should doubt that. RICH MILLER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, a two-part question. What, if anything, would prompt the Fed to shift Treasury purchases toward the longer end of the curve as you did with your prior QE programs? And does your guidance today on asset purchases foreclose the possibility that you could, at some point, lengthen maturities while simultaneously tapering the monthly purchase amounts? CHAIR POWELL. Well, Nick, I-on, on the first part of the question, I, I don't-I wouldn't want to sort of talk about hypothetical situations. You know, we, we look at our overall stance of policy, we look at overall financial conditions, we look at what's going on in the economy-different parts of the economy, and we ask ourselves, should we change our policy stance? We do that at every meeting. And we look at where financial conditions are now, and, and we, we feel that they are appropriate for now. Anytime we feel like the economy could, could use stronger accommodation, we would be prepared to provide it. We-but right now, we're providing a great deal, and we think-we happen to think it's the right amount. And, you know, you, you mentioned-I think you're referring to the idea of maintaining the duration but, but reducing the quantity, which is sort of what the Bank of Canada did. And that, that is something that we-you know, that we talked about in the last meeting and was addressed in the minutes. And I would say, the views on that were mixed: Some thought it was an interesting idea, others not so much. I, I wouldn't say that that's something that's, that's high on our list of, of possibilities. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the 13(3) facilities. Chair Powell, you've said that you accept Treasury Secretary Mnuchin's interpretation of the statute of the CARES Act on, on what should happen with those programs. So, first of all, I'm curious whether under a new Treasury Secretary you will accept whatever legal interpretation they put forward for those programs. And then, also, given that there isn't a statutory requirement for you to have financial backing from Treasury for 13(3) facilities, do you have any plans for any future facilities that don't require Treasury backing? CHAIR POWELL. So on your-on your first question, we really have not thought about that. We're, we're very focused on-we have a lot to do now. We, we have not focused on, on that question, and I, I really have nothing to add on that. Your second question is-sorry. Oh, if there were no-yes. No, we, we would have the ability-certainly, we would have the ability to do facilities under 13(3) in some cases with no backing. But we can't do any 13(3) facilities without the approval of the Treasury Secretary, right? But we did some facilities-I think one of our facilities this time didn't have any Treasury backing. And I think some in the-in the round of-during the Global Financial Crisis also didn't have any. VICTORIA GUIDA. So do you have any plans-like, would you consider doing more facilities if that became necessary without Treasury backing? CHAIR POWELL. I would say that we are-you know, we're-we have the authorities we have. We will use them if, if they're needed and if-and if the law permits us to do so. We would-we would always do that. We, we do not have any plans for, for the future about this. We-we're very focused on, on getting through year-end. We've been very focused on, on the issues that are right in front of us. And, honestly, we're not-we're not planning on anything or having any discussions about what we might do down the road. VICTORIA GUIDA. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and happy New Year. I know how much you enjoy talking about fiscal stimulus, so let me ask you directly about fiscal stimulus. There's talk right now of a $900 billion fiscal stimulus program in Congress. Is, is that sufficient? Is that what you're looking for? Do you think that'll be sufficient for helping the economy? Finally, you talked about the idea of how concerning the recent surge is. I wonder if you can put some detail on that. How much concern do you have in terms of, where could employment go? What could happen to GDP in the first quarter as a result of this surge? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So on, on fiscal policy, I would just say a couple of things. The case for fiscal policy right now is, is very, very strong. And I think that is widely understood, I would say, now. The details of it are entirely up to Congress. But with the expiration of unemployment benefits-some of the unemployment benefits, the expiration of eviction moratoriums with the virus spreading the way it is, there's a need for households and businesses to have, have fiscal support. And I do think that-again, I think that is widely understood. So I think it would be-I, I certainly would welcome the work that Congress is doing right now. It's not up to us to judge that work. It's really, really theirs. And I, I don't have a view for you on, on the size of it. It's-you know, it's obviously a substantial bill. On the surge, you know, so it's a really interesting question. We have, and others too, have consistently expected there to be more economic-that, that cases would hold-growth in cases would hold back the economy more than it actually has. So we've overestimated the, the effects on the economy of, of these spikes we've been having. Now, this spike is so much larger that I think-and I think forecasters generally do think that there-that this will have an effect on suppressing activity, particularly activity that involves people getting together in bars and restaurants, on airplanes and hotels and things like that. And you're starting to see that. In the-in the high-frequency data, you're now beginning to see that show up. And I think if this is-the case numbers are so high and so widespread across the country that that, that seems like it must happen. Now, how big will it be? We don't-we don't really know. You know, there are-there are a lot of estimates. The general expectation is, you're seeing some slowing now. And you'll see the first quarter could well be-what, what we said is that coming months are going to be challenging. The first quarter will, will certainly show significant effects from this. At the same time, people are getting vaccinated now. They're getting vaccinated. And by the end of the first quarter into the second quarter, you're going to be seeing significant numbers of people vaccinated. And so then what will be-how will that play into economic activity? Again, we don't have any experience with this. You have to think that sometime in the middle of next year, you will-you will see people feeling comfortable going out and engaging in a broader range of activities. And some people will be probably quick to do that. Some are doing it now without a vaccine-right?-in many parts of the country. So, nonetheless, my expectation-and I think many people have the expectation that the second half of next year should-the economy should be performing strongly. We should be-you know, we should be getting people back to work. Businesses should be reopening and that kind of thing. The issue is more the next four or five months-getting through the next four, five, six months. That is key. And, and, you know, clearly there's going to be need for help there. And, and, you know, my sense and hope is that we'll be getting that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about house prices. They were mentioned in the most recent minutes as, you know, potentially a valuation concern, especially as it related to your mortgage-backed security purchases. And you mentioned earlier today that the housing market looks more or less fully healed. And so I guess I wonder, are you worried about valuation pressures there? And, if so, what can the Fed do to contain those? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so we monitor basically just about every asset price in the economy, and housing prices are something that we've been monitoring. And you see them moving up. You see very high demand. This, this is the housing market that people have been expecting since, you know, 2010. And, and then, you know, not many, when the-when the pandemic hit, thought, ""Oh, this is what-this is what will produce that housing market,"" but it has. Now, I would say, from a financial stability standpoint, housing prices are not-are not of a level of concern right now. That's just reflective of a lot of demand. And, you know, builders are going to bring forth supply. There's also a sense that this-some of this may be pent-up demand from when the economy was closed, which would imply that demand-once that demand is met, that the real level of demand will be more manageable. So it's a-it's a healthy economy now. We, we met recently with a bunch of homebuilders, and many of them in the business 30, 40 years said they've never seen the likes of it. But, no, housing prices themselves are not-are not a financial stability concern at the moment. We will watch that carefully. But in the near term, I wouldn't think that that's an issue that we'd be concerned about. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for the question, Mr. Chairman. So with the actions that you've currently taken, how do you-how do you further fight a slowdown that you're seeing? We've talked about the retail sales numbers are a little bit sluggish this month, the unemployment, the job growth has slowed down. Is there more the Fed can do to fight this? Or is it now squarely in the Congress's realm? CHAIR POWELL. There is more that we can do, certainly. We can-we can expand our, our asset purchase programs. We can focus them more on the longer end. There are a number of options we would have to provide more support to the economy. So I would-I would say, though, that in the near term, the help that people need isn't just from low interest rates that stimulates demand over time and works with long and variable lags. It's really support. As the-as-we've, we've talked about this as all of these government policies trying to work together to create a bridge across this chasm, economic chasm that was created by the pandemic. And for many Americans, that bridge is there and, and they're across it. But there's a group for, for which they, they don't have a bridge yet. And that's who we're talking about here. It's, it's the 10 million people who lost their jobs. It's people who may lose their homes. It's-you know, you see the, the-many, many millions of Americans are, are waiting in food lines in their cars these days all over the country. So we know there's need out there. We know there are small businesses all over the country that, that have been basically unable to really function, and they're just hanging on. So-and, and they're, they're so critical to our economy. So-and, by the way, now that we can-we can kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel, it would be-it would be bad to see, you know, people losing their business, their life's work in many cases, or even generations' worth of work, because they couldn't last another few months, which is what it amounts to. So we have more we can do. And we'll-I, I think more the issue is, we're going to need to continue to provide support to this economy for quite a period of time, because the, the economy will be growing in expectation. We should be growing at a fairly healthy clip by the second half of next year. But it's going to be a while before we really are back to the levels of, of labor market-the, the sort of conditions in the labor market that we had in early this year and for much of the last couple of years. So that's how I think about it. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for doing this. And thanks, Michelle. Two, two quick questions. One, on the vaccine, do you have, or has the Fed modeled, sort of a working estimate of when the U.S. might reach something approaching herd immunity? And, secondly, if you could, please connect with me the lack of movement on the decision to maintain the current pace and quantities of bond purchases with the fact that the SEPs are showing three years with inflation not reaching 2 percent. Some might argue that you need to do more to start fixing those expectations, and to let this drift and say ""We're going to miss our target for another three years"" doesn't show a very firm commitment to the new framework. CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of the vaccine, yes, you know, we do estimates of, of when the United States would reach herd immunity, and they're, they're going to be similar to what other people think. You know, it depends on your assumptions, such as how many people will actually take the vaccine and how fast will the rollout be. So it's assumption based on assumption based on assumption. But, you know, sometime-it's possible sometime in the middle or second half of next year. I'm not going to try to be precise, because it's just another estimate. You know, our people are very good, but they're looking at, at the same data as other people are. And so, you know, all the estimates are-it depends on what your assumptions are. But under a normal set of assumptions, it could happen as, as soon as the middle of next year. In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things-your second question. You know, we're-I think you have to be honest with yourself about, about inflation these days. There are-there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, and there have been for a while, and they persist today. It's, is not going to be easy to have inflation move up. And it isn't going to be just a question-it's going to take some time. It took a long time to get inflation back to 2 percent in the last crisis. And, you know, we're, we're honest with ourselves and with you in the SEP that even with the very high level of accommodation that we're providing both through low rates and very high levels of asset purchases, it will take some time, because that's what we believe the underlying inflation dynamics are in our economy. And that's sort of why we're-one reason why we're concerned about inflation is that we see that. And, and that's why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework. That's why we're aiming for an overshoot. But we're, we're honest with ourselves and with the public that it will take some time to get there. In terms of, you know, would, would it really speed it up a lot to, to move asset purchases, you know, I don't think that would really be-I think it's going to take a long time however you do it. And, you know, we've been having very long expansions since-in, in the last several decades because inflation has not-really, the old model was, inflation would come along and the Fed would tighten, and we'd have a recession. Now inflation has been low, and we haven't had that dynamic. And the result has been three of the four longest expansions in, in modern history, in recorded history. So, you know, we're, we're thinking that this could be another long expansion, and that we'll keep our-what we're saying is, we're going to keep policy highly accommodative until the expansion is well down the tracks. And we're not going to preemptively raise rates until we see inflation actually reaching 2 percent and being on track to exceed 2 percent. That's a very strong commitment, and we think that's the right place to be. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber. I'm sorry, Mr. Chair. CHAIR POWELL. I'm just going to add, markets have actually found this fairly credible. If you look at what-at inflation compensation and at the survey measures of, of when the Fed will lift off, everything has moved. There have been significant movements since we announced the framework in the direction that is consistent with the-with the framework being credible to market participants. So I, I don't think it's something that-I, I mean, I'm actually pleased by, by the reception it's gotten in markets. And markets have moved in ways that suggest it is credible. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, thank you. Yesterday, I guess, the Fed said that it is joining the international financial greening group. And I just wanted to see if you could expand on how the Fed is thinking about climate change and how it might affect Fed policy going forward. Specifically, I think Janet Yellen drew a distinction between considering climate change when it comes to financial regulation. But how do you see that also potentially affecting monetary policy? Obviously, there have been criticisms of the Fed for buying bonds of oil and gas companies. But leaving that specific case aside, I mean, are there-is there any way that climate change considerations could affect monetary policy going forward? CHAIR POWELL. So the-you're, you're talking about the-sorry, the Network [of Central Banks and Supervisors] for Greening the Financial System, which we joined this week. And I'll just-I'll just say a couple things about that. So, first, I'll just start by saying that we're going to move carefully and thoughtfully on developing an understanding of how climate change affects our work, including the areas you mentioned. We're going to do so with a great deal of engagement with all of our external constituencies, including the public and their elected representatives who are charged with our oversight. We'll do it with great transparency. Remember that we are a nonpolitical agency whose goals and authorities to achieve those goals are set by Congress. We have great responsibilities and strong authorities that we'll use vigorously. We're not the forum where all the great issues of the day are to be hashed out, debated, and addressed unless and only to the extent that those issues are directly relevant to our statutory goals and are addressable through our legal authorities. And because we have a narrow remit, and because we stick to it, Congress has given us a precious grant of independence from direct political control. So society's broad response to climate change is for others to decide-in particular, elected leaders. But-so let me-let me get to your question. What does all that mean for an issue like climate change? And why did we join the NGFS? So Congress hasn't explicitly assigned us or other financial regulators a role, and we're not among the agencies who contribute to the National Climate Assessment-Climate Assessment, for example. But climate change is nonetheless relevant to our existing mandates under the law. And let me tell you why. One of our jobs is to regulate and supervise banks and to look after the stability of the financial system. That's a responsibility we share with other agencies. The public will expect that we will-we will do that. So we'll, we'll expect that, that those important institutions will be resilient against the many resists-risks that they fake-face: credit risk, market risk, cyber risk. Climate change is an emerging risk to financial institutions, the financial system, and the economy. And we are, as so many others are, in the very early stages of understanding what that means, what needs to be done about it, and by whom. That's why 83 central banks have joined together to share research and identify best practices in this important emerging area. We've been attending NGFS meetings as an observer for more than a year, taking part in the work. We had discussed that it was probably time to join as a member. I'll just say that the financial system is really a global one. It's important that we work and discuss best practices with peer agencies around the world, especially in a field where we're just beginning to develop our, our understanding. You asked about monetary policy. You know, I-I'll say this. We, we have historically shied away strongly from taking a role in credit allocation. In fact, our agreement with Treasury during the financial crisis from back in 2009 or '10 says that we will avoid credit allocation. It's something we've carefully avoided. So I, I would be very reluctant to see us move in that direction, picking one area as creditworthy and another not. So you asked about monetary policy. You know, it's, it's-for now, I would say the real-the real concern is-the real place to focus, for me, is supervision of financial institutions and then financial stability concerns. You can see a connection there. Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices-it's less obvious to me. I can-I can, you know-I can make the argument, but it's less obvious to me that those should be first-order things that we would look at in connection with climate change. But I think there's-I think there's work to be done to understand the connection between climate change and the strength and resilience of financial markets and financial institutions. I think that work is in its early days. And, again, we'll be careful. We'll be thorough and transparent and, and engage with the public on all that. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. And thank you, Michelle. I wanted to ask specifically about state and local aid. Just as one example, the governor of Illinois announced roughly $700 million in early anticipated budget cuts to close the budget deficit, and the latest bipartisan stimulus proposal that's being debated this week seems to be leaving out state and local aid at this point. And I'm just curious if you can give some detail about the damage that these budget deficits or the lack of aid specifically to state and local governments will have on the recovery and, specifically, with the municipal lending facility set to expire, what more the Fed might be able to do to fill that specific hole. Thanks very much. CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So the state and local governments, they provide important critical services: safety, fire, police, health, all kinds of things like that. They're, they're really involved in people's lives, state and local governments are, to, to a large extent. The decision whether to, to provide more fiscal support to them is entirely in the hands of Congress. And, you know, they're in the middle of these discussions, and, and those, those are issues for them to decide. I would say that the picture is mixed. What's happened is, if you're a state that has a significant exposure to tourism or to extracting energy from the ground-oil from the ground, or gas-you are probably, at least in those industries, feeling a significant loss of revenue. A number of other states have been surprised on the upside, where-and that's because goods sales, for example-property taxes are-don't move much year to year. And, you know, the kind of sales taxes on goods-goods sales have been very high. Income has been more or less replaced by, by the CARES Act-fully replaced, more than, in many cases. So the concerns that we had at the very beginning of really serious, deep shortfalls and massive budget cuts on the part of state and local governments have not yet-have not yet occurred. What we're seeing is, is that it's different state to state. And some states are having significant difficulties, others not so much. The real concern, though, that still emerges is, state and local governments are very large employers, and-one of the largest. And so far, since the pandemic began, employment has dropped by 1.3 million in-of state and local government. So it's, it's a very large number of people to be-to be out of work from just that one source. It's actually significantly more than lost their jobs during the Global Financial Crisis. So that is-that is a significant-a significant part of that group is, is in education. So when the schools reopen, a significant part of that 1.3 million would go back to work. Nonetheless, it's a concern. We're, we're watching carefully to understand why that-why that many people have been let go and what are-really are the sources. So we're monitoring it carefully, and it's a mixed picture. And I, I just have to leave the question of what to do with fiscal policy on this to Congress. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi. JAMES POLITI. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. You and the Fed have consistently said that the Fed is ready to provide the economy with more monetary support if needed and really stressed to policymakers generally that the dangers of not doing enough outweigh the risks of doing too much in a situation where there's so much suffering in the economy. The guidance today sort of cements asset purchases for a longer period of time but is not a big new easing step. Why was now, with the short-term outlook deteriorating due to the new coronavirus surges, not the moment for a big new easing step? And is it because of the medium-term outlook improving? Or is it because the Fed just doesn't have the capacity to sort of build that bridge over the next four to five months for the-for the people who are struggling? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So I, I could go back, James, to what I said earlier, which is, this is-this is a very, very large asset purchase program. It's providing a tremendous amount of, of support for the economy. If you look at the interest-sensitive parts of the economy, they're performing very well. The parts that are not performing well are not struggling from high interest rates. They're struggling from exposure to, to COVID, in a sense. These are-these are the businesses that, that are really hit hard by people's reluctance to gather closely. So, so we, we do have the ability to-you know, to buy more bonds or to buy longer-term bonds. And, and we may-we may use it. I'm not saying we won't-we won't use that. It may well come to, to using that. But also, I would remind-I would also note, though, monetary policy works with ""long and variable lags,"" is the famous statement. So we think that the big effects from monetary policy are, you know, months and months into the future. So this looks like a-you know, it looks like a time when what is really needed is fiscal policy. And, and that's why it is, is a very positive thing that, that we're getting that. So we, we remain open to doing-you know, to, to either increasing the size of our asset purchases, if that turns out to be appropriate, or to just moving the maturities, moving to buying longer maturities, because that had-that also increases accommodation by taking more duration risk out of the market. But we think our current stance is appropriate. And we think that our-you know, that our, our guidance on asset purchases today will also provide support to the economy over time. Again, what we've-what we've done is, we've laid out a path whereby we're going to keep monetary policy highly accommodative for a long time, really until-really until we reach very close to our goals, which is not, you know, not really the way it's been done in the past. So that's, that's providing significant support for the economy now. We don't think the economy suffers from a lack of, of highly accommodative financial conditions. We think it's suffering from the pandemic and people wanting to not engage in certain kinds of economic activity. And we expect that, that with the virus, that that will improve-that condition will improve. Nonetheless, again, we will-are prepared to use our tools, and we will use them at such time and in such amounts as we-as we think would, would help. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Scott Horsley, NPR. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Some forecasters have suggested that there is a lot of pent-up demand for travel and entertainment and, and services and the like that might stop being pent up in a hurry if we do get to a point where the vaccine is widely distributed, and that the beaten-down service sector might have trouble meeting that demand in, in a hurry. How might that affect inflation, in your mind? And would that be just a transient problem or, or something that might warrant closer scrutiny? CHAIR POWELL. So that, that has all the markings of a transient increase in the price level. So you can imagine that as people really want to travel again-let's say, you know, that airfare, airfares-I'm just imagining this, right?-that they go up. But what inflation is, is a process whereby they go up year upon year upon year upon year. And if-given the inflation dynamics that we've had over the last several decades, just a single, single sort of price-level increase has not resulted in ongoing price-level increases. And that, that was-the problem back in the 1970s was, it was the combination of two things. One, when unemployment went down and resources got tight, prices started going up. But the second problem was that that-that that increase was persistent, there was a level of persistence. So if prices went up 6 percent this year, they'd go up 6 percent next year, because people would internalize. I mean, really, really, that's what happens is, people internalize that they can raise prices, and that it's okay to pay prices that are going up at that rate. So that was the inflation-those are the inflation dynamics of that era. Those dynamics are not in place anymore. There-the connection between low unemployment or other resource utilization and inflation is so much weaker than it was. It's still there, but it's a-it's a faint heartbeat compared to what it was. And the persistence of inflation, if you-if you get a-for example, oil prices go up, and that'll send a temporary shock through the economy. The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there. So they-what you describe may happen, and, of course, we would watch it very carefully. We, we understand that we will always be learning new things from the economy about how it will behave in certain cases. But I would-I would expect, though, going in that that would be a one time price increase rather than an increase in underlying inflation that would be persistent. SCOTT HORSLEY. So not the kind of thing that the Fed would, would be trigger-happy to, to- CHAIR POWELL. No. SCOTT HORSLEY. -respond to? CHAIR POWELL. No, no. Definitely not. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. [Inaudible]-question. But what I wanted to ask was, you know, given the size of all the government borrowing and, you know, different regulatory changes in the financial sector, do you think that the Treasury market, long run, can operate smoothly without some sort of active Fed presence-you know, buying Treasury debt? You know, I'm referring back to [inaudible] Randal Quarles. He had some questions about it. So I wanted to know where you stood on that issue. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So-you were breaking up a little. I think-I think I got the sense of it, though. Yes, I, I don't think it's at all a foregone conclusion that there needs to be a permanent Fed presence. And we certainly don't-you know, that's not something we're planning on or intending. Right now we're buying assets because it's a-you know, it's a-it's a time when the economy needs highly accommodative monetary policy, and we think our asset purchases are, you know, one of the main delivery mechanisms for that, the size of the balance sheet. You know, there's lots of demand for, for U.S. Treasury paper all-from all over the world. And I, I think we need to be thoughtful about the structure of the Treasury market and look at ways to make sure that the capacity is there for it to be handled by the private sector. And there's, there's quite a lot of work going on on that front. But I, I don't presume at all that, that this is something that needs to be-where the Fed needs to be in there at all. I, I would think that this should be handled by the private sector and can be. Institutions need to be able to hold this paper. And there may be-there may be a central clearing angle that would, you know, net a lot of risk. That's, that's yet to be proven. There are a lot of things that are being looked at right now. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang. HANNAH LANG. Hi, hi. Thanks so much for taking our questions. So, you know, as you know, the pandemic has really disproportionately impacted small and medium-sized businesses. And the Fed launched a few efforts this year to-through its 13(3) programs to reach out to those companies. But, you know, considering that some of those programs are ending, is there anything else that the Fed's actions can do to provide support to those companies? Or is that solely Congress's domain? CHAIR POWELL. I think the main thing that those companies need is a-is a robust recovery-a strong, robust recovery. And so we, we contribute to that through highly accommodative monetary policy, through accommodative financial conditions that are supporting economic activity. Health authorities are contributing to that through, through, you know, management of the spread of the virus and now through vaccines and the delivery of those vaccines. And Congress contributes, contributes to that by helping them make it through this very difficult time. And, and I think my understanding is that there's support for small businesses in, in what's being discussed on Capitol Hill. I would certainly think that would be something well worth looking at. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul La Monica. PAUL LA MONICA. Hi, Chair Powell-hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering if you've had any conversations yet with any members of the incoming Biden Administration, particularly Janet Yellen, who obviously you can share some similar experience in running the Fed. So just curious to get your thoughts on how the relationship with Treasury and the new Administration might differ than the past couple of years. CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we've had a-and I've had sort of the typical meetings with the transition team for Treasury. They've met with quite a lot of people in our agency and other agencies. And, really, it's about learning what we do. And I, I really have only spoken to former Chair Yellen to congratulate her on being nominated and just to say that I look forward to working with her. You know, I did work very closely with her for five years before she left and have stayed in touch, you know. So I did that. But I have not discussed, you know, policy with her. And I, I'm not going to do that until she's confirmed. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Jeff Cox. JEFF COX. Yes. Chair, thank you for taking the question. You've been asked this question before in various forms. I'm going to try it a little bit differently now. The equity market and the bond market seem to be telling two different stories about where, where things are heading. We [inaudible] on the stock market, bond yields remain very low. Does that concern you at all? Are, are you getting any more concerned about asset valuations in, in light of the highly accommodative Fed policies? CHAIR POWELL. You, you were breaking up, but I, I think I got that. I think I got it. So, you know, financial stability-we, we look at a broad range of things. We actually have a framework so that we can, you know, be-evaluate changes in financial stability over time, and so that the public can evaluate whether we're doing a job-a good job at it. We-so what do we look at? Asset prices is one thing that we look at. And, you know, we published a report a few weeks ago on that-maybe it was month or so ago. Anyway. And I think you'll find a mixed bag there. It depends-with equities, it depends on whether you're looking at P/Es or whether you're looking at the premium over risk-free-over the risk-free return. If you look at P/Es, they're historically high, but, you know, in a world where the-where the risk-free rate is sustain-is going to be low for a sustained period, the equity premium, which is really the reward you get for taking equity risk, would be what you'd look at. And that's not at, at incredibly low levels, which would mean that they're not overpriced in that sense. Admittedly, P/Es are high, but that's-you know, that's, that's maybe not as relevant in a world where we think the 10-year Treasury is going to be lower than it's been historically, from a-from a return perspective. You know, we look at-we also look at borrowing-leverage of financial institutions. We spent 10 years and the banks spent 10 years building up their capital. So far, they've been a source of strength through this crisis, and their capital has held up well. We look at leverage in the nonfinancial sector-that's households and nonfinancial corporates. Nonfinancial corporate leverage is high. We've been watching that. But, you know, rates are really low. So-and so companies have been able to handle their debt loads even in weak periods, because rates are-rates are quite low. Your interest payments are low. Defaults and downgrades have, have declined since earlier in the year. Households came into this very strong, and there certainly has been a hit there for people who are unemployed. But, you know, with the CARES Act, Congress replaced a lot of lost income. You know, it's very important that, that the economy gets strong again. I mean, the, the ultimate thing to support financial stability is a strong economy. The last thing is, is really funding markets. We found that there was a lot of unstable funding for companies, particularly financial companies. And that's, that's down to a-to a very low level these days. So the broad financial stability picture is, is kind of mixed, I would say. I would say, you know, asset prices are, are a little high in that metric and in my view. But, overall, you have a mixed picture. You, you don't have, you know, a lot of red flags on that. So-and it's-again, it's something that we monitor essentially ongoing, almost daily. You know, we're, we're monitoring these prices for that and, and have published our, our framework, and, you know, we'll be held accountable for what we saw and what we missed. So we work very hard at it. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. And for the last question we'll go to Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions about the fiscal support for the economy. This year's budget deficit is $3.1 trillion. And Republicans have argued they don't want to spend more, because we can't afford it. So I'm wondering if you can make the case for how much we can afford. At what point do deficits and the debt start to have an impact on the economy or on interest rates? And how would we know when we get there? CHAIR POWELL. So people who-people who run for elected office and win, they're the ones-their reward is they get to make those very difficult decisions. And-you know, so we're not charged with providing fiscal advice to, to Congress. But I, I would just say, as a general-as a general rule, it is important to be on a sustainable fiscal path. For my way of thinking and many others', the time to focus on that is when the economy is strong and when unemployment is low and taxes are-you know, are, are pouring in, and there's, there's room to get on-get on a sustainable path, because the economy's really doing well. You're still now in the-in the, you know, some part of, of an economic crisis. And the fact that Congress is debating a fairly large bill today suggests that, that-you know, suggests that something fairly substantial is going to get done, we hope-that what's being discussed is, you know, is, is of some size. In terms of what is a sustainable level, I think, you know, it's-the question is-we've always looked at debt to GDP, and we're very high by that measure. By some other measures, we're actually not that high. In particular, you can look at the real interest rate payments, the amount of, what does it cost? And from that standpoint, if you-if you sort of take real interest costs of the federal deficit and divide that by GDP, we're actually-you know, we're actually on a more sustainable fiscal path if you look at it through those eyes. Again, these are-these are issues for Congress. But, you know, I'll just say in the near term, I think fiscal-the case for, for fiscal is, is strong. And I'm certainly hoping-I think it will be very good for the economy if, if we did get something soon. MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, the argument for continuing to spend is that low interest rates make it affordable. Do you worry you get in a situation where you would have congressional interference in monetary policymaking or at least feel significant political pressure to keep rates low because the country can't afford to pay a significant interest bill? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I mean, that's-I think we're a very, very long way from that. You know, the, the Congress has given the Fed independence on the condition that we stick to our knitting. We try very hard to do that. And I, I think that's, that's what people call fiscal dominance. And I, I think we're just a very, very long way from that. I think, you know, if we-if we do our jobs well and support the economy and achieve maximum employment and stable prices, keep the financial system stable, I don't think that that is something that will-that I would worry about, certainly not in the near term. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Good afternoon."
