"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the first question, we'll go to Chris Rugaber at the Associated Press. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thanks, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. So it's expected that the Fed will hike rates perhaps every other meeting, but certainly in the past, the Fed has hiked at every meeting. So I just wanted to ask, you know, are rate hikes at consecutive meetings on the table this year? Is every meeting a live-a live meeting? And, on that note, would the Fed consider front-loading some of its rate hikes, even if it doesn't raise at every meeting? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So, as I-as I referred to in my opening statement, it's-it is not possible to predict with much confidence exactly what path for our policy rate is going to prove appropriate. And so, at this time, we haven't made any decisions about the path of policy. And I stress again that we'll be humble and nimble. We're going to have to navigate crosscurrents and actually two-sided risks now. So-and, and I'll say also that we're going to be guided by the data. In fact, what I'll say is that we're going to be led by the incoming data and the evolving outlook, which we'll try to communicate as clearly as possible, moving steadily and transparency-transparently. So more to your question, we know that the economy is in a very different place than it was when we began raising rates in 2015. Specifically, the economy is now much stronger. The labor market is far stronger. Inflation is running well above our 2 percent target, much higher than it was at that time. And these differences are likely to have important implications for the appropriate pace of policy adjustments. Beyond that, we haven't made any decisions. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Victoria Guida at Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you were talking about the health of the labor market. And I'm curious whether you would characterize where we're at right now as maximum employment. And also, along those same lines, obviously rate hikes [are] on the table this year, do you think that the Fed can raise rates, bring inflation under control without hurting jobs and wages? CHAIR POWELL. Sorry. Just getting both, both parts of your question written down. So I would say-and this view is widely held on the Committee-that both sides of the mandate are calling for us to move steadily away from the very highly accommodative policies we put in place during the challenging economic conditions that the economy faced earlier in the pandemic. And I would say that most FOMC participants agree that labor market conditions are consistent with maximum employment in the sense of the highest level of employment that is consistent with price stability. And that is-that is my personal view. And, and, again, very broad support on the Committee for the judgment that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The other thing is, maximum employment will, will evolve over time and through the course of the business cycle. In the particular situation we're in now, it may well increase. Max-the level of maximum-of employment that's consistent with stable prices may increase. And we hope that it will, as more people come back into the labor market, as participation gradually rises. And the policy path that we're broadly contemplating would be supportive of that comment-that outcome as well. So the thing about the labor market right now is that there are-there are many millions of, of more job openings than there are unemployed people. So you ask whether we can-whether we can raise rates and, and move to less accommodative, and even tight, financial conditions without hurting the labor market. I think there's quite a bit of room to raise interest rates without threatening the labor market. This is, by so many measures, a historically tight labor market. Record levels of job openings, of quits. Wages are moving up at the highest pace they have in decades. If you look at surveys of workers, they find jobs plentiful. Look at surveys of companies-they find workers scarce. And all of those readings are at levels, really, that we haven't seen in a long time-and, in some cases, ever. So this is a very, very strong labor market, and my strong sense is that we can-we can-we can move rates up without, without having to, you know, severely undermine it. I also would point out that there are-there are other forces at work this year, which should also help bring down inflation, we hope, including improvement on the supply side, which will ultimately come. The timing and pace of that are uncertain. And also, fiscal policy is going to be less supportive of, of growth this year-not of the level of economic activity, but the fiscal impulse to growth will be significantly lower. So there are multiple forces-which should be working over the course of the year for inflation to come down. We do realize that the timing and pace of that are, are highly uncertain and that inflation has persisted longer than we-than we thought. And, of course, we're prepared to use our tools to assure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. NICK TIMIRAOS. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I, I have a couple of questions on the balance sheet. The statement on the balance sheet today calls for ""significantly reducing"" your holdings. What does that mean? And then, apart from moving sooner and faster to shrink the holdings, are there any other ways in which you and your colleagues are seriously thinking about recalibrating this process? And, finally, how much disagreement is there around how you should use this tool, including active sales rather than passive sales or changes in the composition of reinvestments? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I'm afraid to tell you that those are all great questions, and they're questions that the Committee is just turning to now. So we had-we had a discussion, as you know, at the last meeting, an introductory discussion of the balance sheet and a teeing up of the issues. At this meeting, we've gone through and carefully put together a set of principles at a high level. And those are meant to guide the actual decisions we'll make about the pace and about all of the questions that you're, you're asking. And I expect that this process will, will be something that we spend time on in coming meetings. I can't tell you how many. I can't tell you how long it will take. But-and then, you know, at the appropriate time, we'll provide additional information. So I did-the last cycle when we-when we went through balance sheet issues, we did find that over, over the course of two or three meetings, for example, we did come to interesting and better answers, we thought. So we're just in that process now. And at the next meeting, we'll be turning to, you know, more of the details that you're-that you're asking about. I would say this. The balance sheet is, is much bigger. I'd say it has a shorter duration than the last time. And the economy's much stronger, and inflation is much higher. So-and I think that leads you to-and I said, I've said this-being willing to move sooner than we did the last time and also perhaps faster. But beyond that, it's really-it's really not appropriate for me to speculate exactly what that would be. And, and-but I would point you to principle number one, which is ""the Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy."" So we do want the federal funds rate-we, we want to operationalize that [as the primary means]. And we want the balance sheet to be declining in a predictable manner, and we want it to be declining primarily by adjusting reinvestments. NICK TIMIRAOS. So, if I could follow on that, raising rates and reducing the balance sheet both restrain the economy, both tighten monetary policy. How should we think about the relationship between the two? For example, how much passive runoff is equal to every Â¼ percentage point increase in your benchmark rate? CHAIR POWELL. So, again, we think of the balance sheet as, as moving in a predictable manner, sort of in the background, and that the active tool meeting to meeting is not both of them, it's the federal funds rate. There are-there are rules of thumb-I'm reluctant to land on one of them-that, that equate this. And-but there's also an element of, of uncertainty around the balance sheet. I think we have a much better sense, frankly, of how rate increases affect financial conditions and, hence, economic conditions. Balance sheet [policy] is, is still a relatively new thing for, for the markets and for us, so we're less certain about that. So, again, our-I think our-the pattern we'll follow is to-is to arrive at a, you know, a timing and a pace and composition and all those things and then announce that with advance notice, and, and it will-it will start in the background. And then we'll look to have that just running in the background and have-and have the interest rates, again, be the active tool of monetary policy. That's, that's at least the plan. I can't tell you much more about any of the-any of the very good issues about size, pace, composition, those sorts of things. But we'll be turning to all of those at coming meetings. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Now we'll go to Neil Irwin. NEIL IRWIN. Thank you, Chair Powell. It's Neil Irwin from Axios. Glad to be back. Sir, I was wondering if the volatility we've seen in financial markets in the last few weeks strikes you as anything alarming or that might affect the trajectory of policy. Conversely, to the degree that financial conditions have tightened some, might that be desirable in some ways in achieving your, your tightening goals? CHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy: maximum employment and price stability. And financial conditions matter to the extent that they have implications for achieving the dual mandate. And you also know that we, we look at broader financial conditions, not one or two things, one or two markets. And what we're always asking ourselves is, are we seeing changes that are both persistent and material enough that-of a change in financial conditions-that they are inconsistent with the achievement of our goals? So that's how we're looking at that. And I don't want to comment on today's financial conditions broadly, but we're not looking at any one market or, or so. So that's how we're thinking. In terms of what we've seen, I would say this. We, you know, we said at our last meeting we published the Summary of Economic Projections, the median of which-the median participant expected three rate increases this year. And, you know, it's six weeks, seven weeks later now. And you have seen that our communication channel with the markets is working. Markets are, are now pricing in a number of rate increases. Surveys show that market participants are expecting a balance sheet runoff to begin, you know, at the appropriate time, sometime later this year perhaps. We haven't made that decision yet. So we, we feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and that financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make. And monetary policy works significantly through expectations. So that, that in and of itself is appropriate. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Howard Schneider. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. You know, for a year or so-Hi. Thanks, Chair Powell. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So for a year now, the statements referenced the benchmarks for this initial interest rate increase. Now that we're approaching that moment, what are the benchmarks going to be for subsequent rate increases? I know you can't stipulate the path, but how should we think about the criteria for the next step and the next step? CHAIR POWELL. Well, you're right. We haven't got-we haven't gotten to that point yet. We haven't made a decision yet, and we'll make that decision at the March meeting. We'll make a decision whether to raise the federal funds rate. I would say that the Committee is, is of a mind to, to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming that conditions are appropriate for doing so. We have-we have our eyes on, on the risks, particularly around the world. But we do expect some softening in the economy from Omicron, but we think that that should be temporary. And we think that the economy should-the underlying strength of the economy should, you know, should, should-show through fairly quickly after that. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow just on a related question, the December SEPs had this copacetic sort of set of circumstances where inflation comes down without the federal funds rate ever getting over the estimate of neutral. Given developments since then, do you still think that's a credible narrative for the ultimate path of policy? CHAIR POWELL. I think the path is highly uncertain and that we're committed to using our tools to make sure that inflation, high inflation that we're seeing, does not become entrenched. So a number of factors would be-it's not just monetary policy-a number of factors are supporting a decline in inflation, as I mentioned. Fiscal policy will be-will provide significantly less of an impulse to growth. We do expect this year-although we do expect now that it will come slower than, than we had expected and hoped-that there will be relief on the supply side. So that, too, should-should lower the supply-side barriers, which are a big part of the story of why inflation is high. In addition, monetary policy will be becoming significantly less accommodative. So the question is-you know, we'll, we'll be asking this question all year long, and that will be, are things turning out as we expect? There's a case that, for whatever reason, the economy slows more and inflation slows more than expected; we'll react to that. If, instead, we see inflation at a higher level or a more persistent level, then we'll react to that. And, again, we're, we're well aware that this is a different economy than-than existed during the last tightening cycle, and our policy is going to reflect those differences. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Jeanna Smialek. Let's go to Jeanna. [No response] Okay. Let's go to Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I have one sort of technical question and one question on principle. The technical question is, if, if you're going to discuss balance sheet at the next upcoming meetings and you won't begin balance sheet reduction until after you begin rate hikes, it seems to technically mean that you won't or can't begin balance sheet reduction until the summer. Is that correct? That's the first thing. Second of all, you suggested that, that the-with balance sheet running in the background-that you would possibly be raising rates and running off the balance sheet at the same time. That's sort of the technical question part of it. The principal question I have is, you said it's going to be running in the background. But the statement on the balance sheet principles says ""the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach"" based on ""economic and financial developments,"" which suggests there's something of a reaction function associated to the balance sheet and it won't be running in the background. So can you give us any sense of the discussion or staff presentation on what is the reaction function surrounding the balance sheet? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So let me-let me-let me start by talking about that last paragraph. So you'll remember during the last cycle that this process of building up and then shrinking the balance sheet is a complicated one, and it involves, inevitably, surprises. And so during, during the years, during the prior cycle, we amended our balance sheet principles a number of times. Now, we didn't intend to do that. It just-events required us to do so. So we got a pretty robust paragraph there that says we're free to do this at any time. And it doesn't mean we're going to, but if the situation turns out to be different than we had thought, we're not going to be-we're not going to stick with something that isn't working. That's all that's saying. It's meant to be quite a general statement rather than a, a hint. So, I mean, I like to think that our, you know, our philosophy of the balance sheet is, is embodied in these principles. So, you know, the idea that, for example, the federal funds rate is the primary means of adjusting the stance of policy, that we'll use-determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the balance sheet to foster the dual mandate, that we'll begin to reduce the size after we begin the process of raising rates, and on and on like that. I mean, that-those are all the things that, that try to describe how we will proceed. But maybe at a higher level, to try to get at your question: You know, asset purchases were, were enormously important at the beginning of the recovery in terms of restoring market function, as they were at-right after the-in the critical phase of the Global Financial Crisis. And then after [that], they were a macroeconomic tool to support demand. And now the economy no longer needs this, this highly accommodative policy that we put in place. So it's time to stop asset purchases first and then, at the appropriate time, start to shrink the balance sheet. Now, the balance sheet is, is substantially larger than it needs to be. We've identified the end state as-in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently [and] effectively in the ample-reserves regime. So there's a substantial amount of, of shrinkage in the balance sheet to be done. That's going to take some time. We want that process to be orderly and predictable. And so those are some of the ways that I would think this, this lays out our, you know, the way we-the way we're thinking about this. In terms of the timing, I can't really help you. You know, it just says after, after we get under way. So we're-I would say we are, we're going to have another discussion at, at the next meeting. And my guess is, we'll have at least one other discussion at the meeting after that. And, you know, we'll, we'll tell you as we make progress. And we'll, you know, we'll start the process of allowing runoff and shrinking the balance sheet at what we find to be the appropriate time. It's-I wish I could say more. But, honestly, we haven't made those decisions. And we actually haven't even really had the, the important discussions on a lot of the details that we will have at coming meetings. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Craig Torres. CRAIG TORRES. Chair Powell, Chair Powell. Good afternoon, Michelle and Chair Powell. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, at the beginning of the conversation, you said risks are two sided. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate on what are the risks to the elusive soft landing. Is Fed policy a risk? Overtightening? Or what are the risks? And then second, Chair Powell, I have a quick administrative question. You know, Robert Kaplan's disclosure of his securities transactions-and in a couple of months, Chair Powell, or maybe sooner, you and I will file our tax returns. And we'll list transactions and all kinds of things. And next to those transactions, we'll put dates. And Bloomberg asked for the dates of Mr. Kaplan's transactions. The Dallas Fed is not giving us the dates. And I don't see why this is a matter for the inspector general or anybody else. I mean, why can't he give us the dates? Will you help us get the dates of those transactions? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So you asked about the risks first. So I-you know, the one risk is that inflation risks are still to the upside in the views of most FOMC participants and, certainly, in my view as well. There's a risk that, that the high inflation we're seeing will be prolonged, and there's a risk that it will move even higher. So we don't-we don't think that's the base case, but you asked what the risks are. And that's-we have to be in a position with our monetary policy to address all of the plausible outcomes. And that calls for us to be in position. We, we have an expectation about the way the economy is going to be evolved, but we've got to be in a position to, to address different outcomes, including the one where inflation remains higher. And, of course, that is a risk to the-to the-to the expansion. You know, we've been saying that what we need here is another long expansion, which is the kind of thing we saw over the last [one], which was a record long expansion. We saw labor force participation rise. We saw wages persistently higher for people at the lower end, and there, there really was no obvious imbalance in the economy that threatened that expansion. It could have gone on for years were it not hit by the pandemic. So we'd love to find a way to get back to that. That's going to require price stability, and that's going to require the Fed to tighten interest rate policy and do our part in getting inflation back down to our 2 percent goal. So I mentioned two-sided risks. You know, a couple things. One, Omi-COVID is not over. And COVID can continue to evolve, and it's just-we have to accept that it's not over, and the risks to it can slow down growth. And that would be-that's sort of a downside risk from a growth standpoint. I would point to-you know, another, another risk is just further, further problems in the supply chains, which could slow down activity. And you see the situation in China as a situation there where that's-their no-COVID policy may cause more lockdowns, is likely to, and that may play into-may play into more problems in supply chains. In addition, there's what's going on in Eastern Europe and things like that. So there's plenty of risk out there. And we, you know, we can't-we can't forget that there are risks on both sides. So that's, that's there. That's what I would say. I know you've been all over this issue with, with my colleagues, Craig, on the issue of, of information. We don't-we don't have that information at the Board. And, you know, I hand-I asked the inspector general to do an investigation, and that is out of my hands. I play no role in it. I seek to play no role in it. And I don't-I really-I can't help you here today on this issue. And I'm sorry I can't. CRAIG TORRES. Okay, okay. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Jeanna now. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. And sorry for my tech issues. I wonder if you could tell us a little bit about where your thinking on inflation stands today. You know, the last time we saw an SEP back in September, we saw that you and your colleagues were projecting that inflation would sort of sink back down quite close to target by the end of the year. And I wonder if you still think that projection from December is a reasonable one. And if your thinking has changed at all, I wonder how you're thinking about that. And I also wonder if you could talk a little bit about the pathway to getting to that deceleration. Like, how do-how do we get from here, 7 percent CPI, to where you expect to be at the end of the year? CHAIR POWELL. So I'd say, you know, since, since the December meeting, I would say that the inflation situation is about the same but probably slightly worse. I'd be inclined to raise my own estimate of 2022 core PCE inflation-let's just go with that-by a few tenths today. But we're not writing, writing down an SEP at this meeting. But I think it's-it hasn't gotten better. It's probably gotten just a-just a bit worse, and that's been the pattern. That's been the pattern. So I think if you look at the-the FOMC participants are-there's a range there. And that range has been moving to the right for, for a year now. And, by the way, if you look at other forecasters, essentially all other macro forecasters who do this for a living, you've seen the same pattern. So, what do we think about that? Well, I think we, you know, we wrote down rate increases in the December meetings, each of us individually. And I think to the extent the situation deteriorates further, our policy will have to address that, if it deteriorates meaningfully further, either in the time dimension or in the size of the inflation dimension. So that's how we're thinking about it. I-as I mentioned, though, I think it's-part of this will be that us, the Fed, moving away from a very highly accommodative policy to a substantially less accommodative policy and then, over time, to a policy that's not accommodative, in time. I don't know when that will be. That's-those are the things that we're-that we're thinking about. That's, that's part of it. Another part of it is that fiscal policy provided an impulse to growth over the last two years. That impulse will be less, in fact, will be-will be negative this year. And so that's another thing. The other one is, we will eventually get relief on the supply side. And, you know, the ports will be cleared up. And there will be semiconductors and things like that. Now, what we're learning is, it's just taking much longer, so I think-longer than expected. And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent. I do think we'll come off of the highs that we saw in the early part of this episode in the-in the spring last year. But, really, what's-the question is going to be, what is inflation running at? And so we'll be watching that. And I, you know, we-our objective is to get inflation back down to 2 percent. It's also to provide enough support to keep the labor market healthy. The labor market is very, very strong right now, and I think that that strength will continue. There's a-there's really a shortage of workers. We see it particularly among production and nonsupervisory workers and people in the lowest quartile. You see very large wage increases. I mentioned some of the other indicators. So I think that's, that's what we're looking at. And we're also-you know, we realize, I think, as everyone does, that this outlook is quite uncertain and that we're going to have to adapt. And we're going to communicate as clearly as we can. But we're going to have to be adaptable and, you know, move, move as appropriate. JEANNA SMIALEK. Great. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Colby Smith. COLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, when you talk about being humble and nimble about the path forward for monetary policy, does that also include the possibility of raising interest rates by larger increments and, say, doing a 50 basis point hike at some point if inflation does not moderate sufficiently? And should we interpret this approach as a departure from the gradual pace that we saw during the last hiking cycle? CHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, we have not made these decisions. We really haven't. And, and what I can tell you now, though, is that we fully appreciate that this is a different situation. If you look back to where we were in 2015, '16, '17, '18 when we were raising rates, inflation was very close to 2 percent, even below 2 percent. Unemployment was, was not at our estimates of the natural rate. And growth was, you know, in the 2 to 3 percent range. Right now, we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and, and, you know, more persistently than we would like. We have growth-even in forecasts, even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022-we still see growth higher than, substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate. And we see a labor market where, by so many measures, it is historically tight. I think the-you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment. If you look at things like quits and job openings, as I mentioned earlier, and wages, you're seeing-and, and just the ratio of job openings to unemployed-you're seeing a very, very tight labor market. Now, we also know that labor force participation is significantly lower. It's 1Â½ percentage points lower than it was in February of 2020. Maybe a [full] percentage point of that is, is retirements. Some part of those retirements are, are, you know, related to COVID rather than just regular retirements. So we think there's, there's a pool of people out there who could come back into the labor force. But it's not happening very quickly, and it may not-it may continue to not happen very quickly as long as the pandemic is on[going]. So that's, that's, that's how we think about that. We haven't made-to your specific question-we really have not addressed those questions. And we'll begin to address them as we-as we move into the March meeting and meetings after that. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk to us about any metrics that the Fed uses to assess how inflation affects different groups of Americans, especially lower-, lower-income earners? And are you worried that the Fed underestimates, or can't effectively measure, the impact of inflation on some of the most vulnerable households? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So it's, it's more a matter of-I think the problem that we're-that we're talking about here is really that people who are on fixed incomes who are living paycheck to paycheck, they're spending most or all of their-of, of what they're earning on food, gasoline, rent, heating their-heating, things like that, basic necessities. And so inflation right away, right away forces people like that to make very difficult decisions. So that's really the point. I don't-I'm not aware of, you know, inflation literally falling more on, on different socioeconomic groups. It's-that's not the point. The point is, some people are just really in a-prone to suffer more. I mean, for people who are economically well off, inflation isn't good. It's bad. High inflation is, is bad, but they're going to be able to continue to eat and keep their homes and drive their cars and things like that. It's more-so that, that's really how I think of it. And, you know, we, we have to control inflation for the benefit of all Americans. But part of-part of it is just that it's particularly hard on people with fixed incomes and low incomes who spent most of their-of their income on necessities, which are-which are experiencing high inflation now. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Michelle, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question here. So year over year, inflation's at a 40-year high. The [increase in] input costs for producer price index for all of 2021 was the highest on record. Some investors fear that the Fed might be moving too late. Now, you said no decisions were made on the path of rate hikes, but was a rate hike more than 25 basis points discussed today? And as a follow to that-because I have problems with the mute button-as a follow to that, you testified that the supply chain issues could be worked out by the end of the year. You talked about that today. The CEO of Ford, though, told Fox Business today that the chip shortage will last into 2023. So today you said inflation will start to ease this year. I want to drill down and get a timeline that you see as to when we could see that relief. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I, I would not say that I would expect the supply chain issues to be completely worked out by the end of this year. I do not expect them, and I have not expected them. What I would say, and I have been saying, is that I expect progress to be made in the second half of this year, mainly-progress because we're not making much progress. If you look at a ton of metrics, you can find some that suggest that delivery times are shorter and inventories in some industries moving up. But, overall, we're not-we're not making progress. And, you know, things like the semiconductor issue are going to-they're going to be quite a long time. I would think they'll go more than through 2023. In terms of-so in terms of being too late, I would just say this. We-our policy needs to be positioned to address the full range of plausible outcomes, as I said, and particularly the possibility that inflation will continue to run higher, more persistently than we'd expected. And we think we are positioned to make the changes in our policy to do that, and, and we're committed to doing that. And that's, that's really where we are. In terms of your, your question about the, the size of rate increases, we haven't-we haven't faced those decisions. We haven't made them. It isn't possible to sit down here today and tell you with any confidence what the-what the precise path will be. But in-as we work our way through this, meeting by meeting, we are aware that this is a very different, different expansion, as I've said a couple times, with higher inflation, higher growth, a much stronger economy. And I think those differences are likely to be reflected in-in the policy that we implement. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Mike McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to sort of weave some of the strands of your answers together and ask you, as you start to reverse policy, what your goal is. Are you going to be raising interest rates until you get inflation to 2 percent? Do you want to go below 2 percent so that, on average, you get a 2 percent inflation rate? And because you said we have to protect the employment part of your mandate, is there some sort of circuit breaker that would stop you from raising interest rates on the employment side? CHAIR POWELL. So, no. There's no-there's nothing in our framework about having inflation run below 2 percent so that we would do that, try to achieve that outcome. So the answer to that is, is ""no."" What we're trying to do is get inflation, keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent. That's, that's always the, the ultimate goal. And we do that in the service of having inflation-we get to that goal by having inflation average 2 percent over time. And if inflation doesn't average 2 percent over time, then it's not clear why inflation expectations would be anchored at 2 percent. So that, that's the way we think about that. You know, it-what was the last part of your-of your question? MICHAEL MCKEE. I was asking if you're protecting the employment side of the mandate, whether there's some sort of circuit breaker there. CHAIR POWELL. Nothing like that. I mean, I would say you have a tremendously strong labor market. And you have growth this year at-forecast to be well above-well above potential. I mean, people who are forecasting growth think potential growth is around 2 [percent]. Most forecasts [of actual growth] are significantly above that for 2022, and that's even with, with policy becoming substantially less accommodative. So the labor market's going to be strong for some time. We're-ideally, what we're trying to achieve is inflation getting back down to 2 percent. And we're trying to do that in a process that, that, that accomplishes-you know, that will also leave the labor market in a very strong position. And no one really knows what that will take. Again, I would say that it isn't just monetary policy that's helping inflation get down. It'll be supply-side improvements, and it'll be less, less fiscal, you know, less fiscal impulse in all likelihood. So-but monetary policy will do our job. It is our job to get inflation down to 2 percent. And a situation where, where the two goals are-the two goals can be in tension is a difficult one. But I-but I don't really think they are here, though, because I think a really significant threat to further strengthening in the labor market in the form of higher participation over time is high inflation. And also, high inflation is taking away the benefits of some of these larger wage increases that we're seeing now. So we do hope to achieve, and our plan is to achieve, both of those goals. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could-if I could follow up, does the danger of tightening too much as policy works its way into the economy with a lag mean that you should go back to being more forecast dependent in making decisions, rather than the state dependency you've been using as a framework for the last year and a half or so? CHAIR POWELL. State dependency was particularly around the thought that if we-if we saw a very strong labor market, we would wait to see actual inflation-actual inflation before we tightened. And so that was a very state-dependent thought because, for a long time, we'd been tightening on the expectation of high inflation, which never appeared. And that was the case for, for a number of years. So in this particular situation, we will be clearly monitoring incoming data as well as the evolving outlook. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask you, with the benefit of hindsight, and I realize, I mean, that is what it is. But do you feel that, you know, monetary policy and fiscal policy maybe did too much to react to the crisis and that part of the inflation problem that we're having right now is because the government response, you know, collectively was more than what the economy ended up needing? CHAIR POWELL. So I think it's too soon to write that history, really. But what I would say is this. The-if you remember what it felt like at the beginning of the pandemic, literally the global economy shutting down in large part, including our own economy, and people going to their homes for weeks on end in masks, and there are no vaccines, and it could be a really long time to get them, you know. And then, you know, you have-economic activity drops by a shocking amount in one-so there was a real risk of lasting damage. And I think Congress responded remarkably with the-with the CARES Act, incredibly timely and very powerful. People will-there'll always be flaws in these things. But in real time, it was a remarkable achievement. And we responded. And what we were able to do was, you know, stave off a collapse of the financial system at the beginning and make time for what really needed to happen, which was the income replacement and then the recovery that Congress enabled with the CARES Act. So now, that was a lot of-that was a lot. And what we did was a lot. And, you know, now-so, what we have now is, we have the strongest recovery of any, any country. And we have-we have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we've had, because we've, we've put so much support behind the recovery. And we're managing the, the relatively high-class problems that come with that, which are high inflation and a labor shortage. So-and these are serious problems, very serious problems that we, you know, we're working as hard as we can on. Was it too much? Again, I'm going to leave that to the historians. And-but look, in 25 years, we'll look back at this incident, which will be a, you know, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-year period. And we'll say, you know, we'll have a-we'll have a much better basis to make a judgment about the actions that people took. But it was all founded, though, in a-in a very strong reaction to a, you know, to a unique historical event. And I guess I'll have to leave it at that. I look for-I hope I'll be around to see how that looks in 25 years. MICHAEL DERBY. Fair enough. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Jean Yung. JEAN YUNG. Thanks, Michelle. Chair Powell, some investors are expecting the yield curve could flatten, or even invert, after rate hikes begin. Would that worry you, and how important is that risk in the Fed's consideration for adjusting policy? CHAIR POWELL. So we, we do monitor the slope of the yield curve, but we don't control the slope of the yield curve. Many flat-many factors influence longer-term interest rates. But it is something that we watch, and, and you will know that from when we had this issue a few years ago. And we take it into account, along with many other financial conditions, as we try to assess the implications of all those conditions for the economic outlook. So that's, that's one thing I would say. Another is, currently, you've got a slope. If you think about 2s to 10s, 2-year Treasury to 10-year Treasury, I think that's around 75 basis points. That's well within the range of a normal-of a normal yield-curve slope. So it's something we're monitoring. We don't think of it as-I don't think of it as some kind of an iron law. But we do look at it and try to understand the implications and what it's telling us. And it's-but it's one of many things that we monitor. JEAN YUNG. Can I follow up real quick and ask, if it-if it did invert, would you tie it to U.S. fundamentals? Or would it be driven by a much broader set of factors? CHAIR POWELL. We'd-that's, that's a good question in, in real time. Obviously, U.S. long-term sovereign debt is an-is an important global asset. And it-and the fact that our rates are so much higher than, than other risk-free sovereign rates around the world may put something of a ceiling on our-on our rates. I don't know. But it would really depend on the-on the facts and circumstances at that time. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Cheung for the last question. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. Within the context of just the broad effort to normalize rates, would you describe what you want to do as a gradual hiking? And then, secondly, within the context of hiking cycles, it's often the talking point for financial stability and wanting to make sure that asset bubbles don't emerge. Is that something that has also factored into the conversation as you start to think about hiking rates? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. I would describe what we're doing along these lines. This is going to be a year in which we move steadily away from the very highly accommodative monetary policy that we put in place to deal with the-with the economic effects of the pandemic. And that's going to involve a number of things. It's going to involve and does involve finishing asset purchases. It's going to involve lifting off. And it's going to involve additional rate increases as appropriate. And we, we have-we're going to write down in March our next assessment of what that might be. It's going to continue to evolve as the data evolve. We need to be quite adaptable, I think, in our understanding of this. The last thing we're going to do is, we're going to have a couple more meetings, I think, to talk about allowing the balance sheet to begin to run off and [to] do so in a predictable manner. And that's, that's something that we will also be doing as appropriate. And I wouldn't-I don't think it's possible to say exactly how this is going to go. And we're, we're going to need to be, as I've mentioned, nimble about this. And the economy is quite different this time. I've said this several times now. The economy is quite different. It's stronger. Inflation is higher. The labor market is much, much stronger than it was. And growth is above trend, even this year, let alone last year. So all of those things are going to go into our thinking as we make-as we make monetary policy. And you asked about financial stability concerns. In connection with our policy-was that your question? BRIAN CHEUNG. Yes. Within the context of other hiking cycles, it seems like [a set of] worries about asset bubbles emerging as a result of easy rates has been part of that . I didn't know if that was part of the discussion today. CHAIR POWELL. I would just say this. We, we, of course, have a financial stability framework. And what it shows is a number of, of positive aspects of financial stability. But you mentioned, really, [the behavior of] asset prices is one of the four. So asset prices are somewhat elevated, and they reflect a high risk appetite and that sort of thing. I don't really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that's because households are in good shape financially than they have been. Businesses are in good shape financially. Defaults on business loans are low and that kind of thing. The banks are highly capitalized with high liquidity and quite resilient and strong. There are some concerns in the-in the nonbank financial sector around-still around money market funds, although the SEC is making-has made some very positive proposals there. And we also saw some things in the Treasury market during the acute phase of the crisis, which, which we're looking at ways to address. But, overall, the financial stability vulnerabilities are manageable-are manageable, I would say. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Jeanna at the New York Times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. I wonder if you could detail your thinking a little bit about how you're considering the, you know, the risks of going too fast and potentially tipping the economy into recession and how you're weighing those risks against the possibility of going too slowly, allowing inflation to become embedded, and kind of getting ""behind the curve."" CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would start by saying that, in my view, the probability of a recession within the next year is not particularly elevated. And why do I say that? Aggregate demand is currently strong, and most forecasters expect it to remain so. If you look at the labor market, [you find that it is] also very strong. Conditions are tight, and payroll job growth is continuing at very high levels. Household and business balance sheets are strong. And so all signs are that this is a strong economy and, indeed, one that will be able to flourish-not to say withstand, but certainly flourish-as well in the face of less accommodative monetary policy. So I guess that's how I would say I'm looking at that. Of course, the objective is to achieve price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. And that is our overall objective. But we do feel the economy is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Howard at Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering, in the SEPs, you have quite a markdown to GDP from 4 to 2.8 percent. I'm wondering, how much of that do you feel is the result of the Fed's stiffer-than-expected action here? You talk about monetary policy operating with a lag, but is this going to bite quicker than expected? CHAIR POWELL. I don't think that's a big piece of it, actually. I think some of that is just an early assessment of the effects of spillovers from the war in Eastern Europe, which will hit our economy through a number of channels. Highly uncertain, but, you know, you're looking at higher oil prices, higher commodity prices. It'll be-we think that will weigh on GDP to some extent. So that's part of what moved those assessments down. I don't think-I mean, I think, generally, monetary policy works with a lag, so some of that would also be in there. But remember, as well, that 2.8 percent is still very strong growth. If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth. It would have been one of the strongest years, in fact, of the last expansion. So, while it's lower than last year's 5.8 percent, it's still quite strong growth. So I would say it's quite a strong forecast. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, in that context, what would trigger you to go faster or slower on the rate hikes? ""Ongoing increases"" doesn't really tell us whether this is going to come in bigger chunks or evenly paced through the year. CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, the way we're thinking about this is that every meeting is a live meeting. And we're going to be looking at evolving conditions. And if we do conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly to remove accommodation, then we'll do so. I can't be perfectly specific about it, but that's certainly a possibility as we go through the year. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Rachel at the Washington Post. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm curious if you can be specific on when you expect to see inflation will start to come down, especially with the combination of rates going up, fiscal aid dissipating from the economy, and supply chains getting better? And if you don't start to see that, how will you signal it? What will you be looking for? And what will you be looking for over the course of the year? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say that at the-before the invasion of Ukraine by Russia-so let's go back to that. I would have said that the expectation was that inflation would peak sometime in the first quarter, maybe the end of the first quarter of this year, and then maybe stay at that level or a little bit lower and then start to come down in the back half of the year. So now we're, you know, we're getting-we're going-we're already seeing a little bit of short-term upward pressure in inflation due to higher oil prices, natural gas [prices] a little bit but not so much for us since we have our own natural gas supply, other commodities prices. The other thing is that you're seeing supply chain issues around shipping and around, you know, lots of countries and companies and people not wanting to touch Russian goods. So that's going to mean more tangled supply chains. So that could actually push out [in time] the relief we were expecting on supply chains generally. So I guess I would say that the expectation is still that inflation will begin to come down in the second half of the year. But if you look at where I read the SEP headline median, we still expect inflation to be high this year, lower than last year, and then we expect-though, particularly with the effects of the war, but also the data we've seen so far this year-we expect inflation to remain high through the middle of the year, begin to come down, and then come down more sharply next year. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, over the last six months, the Fed has shifted its policy stance quite a bit. Six months ago, you were still buying assets. Most officials weren't projecting any interest rate increases this year. And yet, despite the shift over the last six months, real rates are as negative today as they were then. So how concerned are you that further inflation surprises will offset the effects of recent policy firming by leading real rates to stay at levels that do not actually provide much restraint to the economy? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So that's one of many ways of capturing the situation, which is that we-the Committee really does understand that the time for rate increases and for shrinking the balance sheet has come. And I would just say, I would go back to ""the economy is very strong,"" as I mentioned. Tremendous momentum in the labor market. We expect growth to continue. As I-it's clearly time to raise interest rates and begin the balance sheet shrinkage. And I just wanted to say that as I looked around the table at today's meeting, I saw a Committee that's acutely aware of the need to return the economy to price stability and [is] determined to use our tools to do exactly that. You couched it in terms of real rates. I would say, if you look at the SEP, you've got people getting close to or even above, in many cases, their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate. So I understand that doesn't do it for real rates. But if you go out a year or two, many people are, in their forecasts, are having tight policy from a real interest rate standpoint. So that's something that we're focused on. Of course, it's a highly uncertain environment. And, you know, we don't know what's going to happen. But we do know that we're going to deploy our tools to achieve our goals-and that includes the price-stability goal. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Victoria at Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So, looking at the Summary of Economic Projections, you all have inflation coming down over the course of the year to 4.3 percent. And then you also have rates going up to what appears to still be below roughly what would be estimated to be the neutral rate, although I know that's a little bit uncertain. So I was just wondering, how much of inflation coming down do you see as actually being as a result of the Fed itself raising rates? And then also, if I could just ask, given that Sarah Bloom Raskin withdrew her nomination, what do you expect to do with the regulatory portfolio? Do you expect to assign a Governor in charge of that? CHAIR POWELL. Okay, sorry. Tell me again your first question. VICTORIA GUIDA. My first question is, how much do you expect inflation to come down as a direct result of the Fed's actions? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So part of inflation coming down at the very beginning is clearly to do with factors other than our policy, and those would include, potentially, the supply chain is getting a little bit better, certainly base effects. You're lapping-as you know, when you look at a 12-month trailing window, you're lapping very high inflation in March, April, May, June of last year. So there should be some effects from that in the 12-month picture. Really what we're looking for, though, is month-by-month inflation coming down. And so it's really, it's all the things we've been talking about, you know, that really haven't helped much, including the shift away from goods and back to services, including supply chains getting better, including labor force participation-all those things that have been sticky and not happening. But a big part of it is, though, is the base effects I mentioned as well. You know, I think monetary policy starts to bite on inflation, and on growth, with a lag, of course. And so you would see that more in '23 and '24. But also, remember we started talking about rate increases last year. For some months now, financial conditions have already incorporated a significant number of rate increases. So it doesn't start today. The effect, the moves are already priced into the market for a few months now. So the clock is running on that, and I think some of that will be seen in the second half of the year as well. So on the regulatory portfolio, I would just say this. You know, we have an obligation to carry out under the law in supervision and regulation, and we're doing that. That's what we're doing. The committee is not active. So what's happening is, things are coming to the full Board, and we're voting on them. We're getting our business done. You know, we got the stress tests done. We've looked at, you know, a number of proposals for mergers and things like that. So we're working ahead. Of course, we don't have a Vice Chair for Supervision, as you mentioned. But we're making do with the situation we have. And a good number of things have come straight to the Board for approval. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Neil Irwin at Axios. [Pause] Let's go to Neil Irwin. NEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. It's Neil Irwin at Axios. Thanks for taking our questions. In the statement of economic projections, we see a forecast of median 1.9 percent fed funds rate at the end of the year, 2.8 end of next year. Wondered whether that aligns with your own expectations, in particular on that point of overshooting the long-term neutral rate. And, also, if you can tell us anything about how that might be paced: front-loaded, back-loaded. How high is the bar for doing 50 at one meeting? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't-Neil, I've never talked about my own SEP projection. It's in there, but I, you know, I think Fed Chairs have generally not done that, because we just haven't done it. It's because we're, you know, we have to put together the consensus on the Committee and present that consensus. So I wouldn't talk about my individual one. And in terms of the pacing of it, I would just point out that that is-there's seven remaining meetings this year. This isn't something we discuss or debate or agree on. But there's seven remaining meetings, and there's seven rate hikes. I would add there's also the shrinkage of the balance sheet, which, you people do the math different ways, but that might be the equivalent of another rate increase just from the runoff of the balance sheet. So I don't-but I don't know. We haven't made any decisions on front-end loading or going steadily through the year. And, as I mentioned, you know, if you look at the SEP, a good number of participants do see more than seven or eight increases this year. And I can't give you, I'm not going to try to give you a really specific test for what it would take to do that. But I will say this, that we'll be looking at the data as they come in. We'll be looking to see whether the data show expected improvement on inflation. We'll be looking at the inflation outlook and making a judgement. And we'll be going-each meeting is a live meeting. And if we conclude that it would be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly, then we'll do so. MICHELLE SMITH. [Long pause] One second. Okay. We're going to try one more time. Colby Smith at the FT. [Long pause] Okay. We'll come back to Colby. Let's go to Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. Thank you, Chair Powell. Thank you, Michelle, for the question. I have a more basic question. The last time the CPI inflation-I know you look at PCE, but CPI inflation-was as high as it is was July of 1981, when the effective federal funds rate was 19.2 percent. But given the current data, how far behind the curve of inflation do you believe the Federal Reserve is, in your mind? CHAIR POWELL. So I just would say a couple things. We have the tools that we need, and we're going to use them. And, as you can see, we have a plan over the course of this year to raise interest rates steadily and also to run off the balance sheet. We will take the necessary steps to ensure that high inflation does not become entrenched, while also supporting a strong labor market. And, as I mentioned, if we conclude that it would be appropriate to move more quickly, we'll do so. I'll leave it to others to make the judgment you asked for. EDWARD LAWRENCE. And then just as a follow on that, I wanted to get you on the record on this. What impact has there been on your job, given the fact that [indaudible]- CHAIR POWELL. We lost you in the middle of the question. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward, can you repeat that question? EDWARD LAWRENCE. -the impact that-given you're not actually confirmed and Governor Brainard is not actually confirmed, has there been any impact on your job or the Fed's ability to handle inflation? CHAIR POWELL. None whatsoever. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let's go to Colby Smith at the FT. COLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, how concerned is the Committee about the notable pickup in services inflation, which is perhaps less likely to self-correct? And to what extent does it alter both the Committee's confidence that long-term inflation expectations will not de-anchor in the coming months as well as the balance of risks that the Fed may need to raise interest rates further above neutral than indicated in the dot plot? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, of course, that's something we're watching report by report. And we're certainly, we noticed it in the last meeting. And it's part of the overall picture. We have expected services inflation to move back up to where it was, and that's part of what's happening is, in the case of some services, prices are still getting back up to where they were before the crisis. In other cases, it's pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services. And, yes, that is concerning. In the meanwhile, we see some progress on the good side. But, really, in this latest report, it was confined to vehicles, which is, admittedly, a large category. So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Steve Liesman at CNBC. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you can help me understand the kind of logic, if there is one, in the SEP here. As I look at the median forecast, for example, for unemployment, it runs for the three-year window below the long-run rate. I look at inflation being above, over the three-year window, the long-run-or call it the neutral-rate, so the economy still runs hot. And that is all true in a regime when you run at least for two years the funds rate above the long-run rate. I guess my question is this: Are you not create-giving a forecast here that essentially suggests you will be continuing to run further ""behind the curve""-and never really get in front of inflation, because the economy will continue to run hot? And, kind of on a related issue: You said earlier [that] inflation will take longer to return to price stability than we had originally expected. Isn't that a choice you're making? And, if so, why are you making that choice to let inflation run above price stability longer than you'd like? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So our, if you look, our-first of all, there is no-you're looking at medians. But understand that there's no, it's not something we voted on. It's not a plan. But if you look, people do have their in-by the end of this year, broadly, people are at or close to or, in some cases, above their estimates of longer-run neutral interest rate. Okay. So that should stop pushing-that should, in other words, that should be a removal of accommodation for monetary policy, basically. At the same time, we will have done significant balance sheet runoff. And you can think of that as further. In the next year, and just looking at the median, you're now above the, you know, above the, what people estimate to be the longer-run median. And also, in many people's forecasts, that actually amounts to, you know, tight policy under, in real rates as well. So why does unemployment remain at 3.5 percent? You know, it-I mean, a couple points. One is the connection between-in the economy we had before the pandemic, the connection between inflation and the level of the unemployment rate was not very tight. But this is-clearly, what this is is an expectation that, really it amounts to that, the idea that wage increases, which are now running above the level that would be consistent over the long run with 2 percent inflation, will move back down to levels which are still very attractive, full-economy kind of-full-employment kind of wages, but not to a point where they're pushing up inflation anymore. And, as I mentioned, there are a lot of factors causing inflation to come down. And, you know, the reality is, there are many, many moving pieces, and we don't know what will actually happen. But no matter what happens, this is a Committee that is determined to use its tools to make sure that higher inflation does not become entrenched. And so we are determined on that front, and we'll deal with what comes. This is a modal, or most likely, expectation. But we'll deal with what comes, whether it's better or worse. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Chris Rugaber at the AP. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Well, let me follow up a bit on that. I mean, there are a lot of economists skeptical that you can reduce inflation as much as you've penciled in without raising the unemployment rate. And I'm wondering, just what are the mechanisms you see in reducing demand? I mean, outside housing and autos, how do higher fed [funds] rates reduce consumer demand unless it's through higher unemployment? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Well, if you take a look at today's labor market, what you have is 1.7-plus job openings for every unemployed person. So that's a very, very tight labor market-tight to an unhealthy level, I would say. So, in principle, if you were-let's say that our tools work about as you described, and the idea is, we're trying to better align demand and supply, let's just say in the labor market. So it would actually, if you were just moving down the number of job openings so that they were more like one to one, you would have less upward pressure on wages. You would have a lot less of a labor shortage, which is going on pretty much across the economy. We're hearing from companies that they can't hire enough people. They're having a hard time hiring. So that's really the thinking there, is, you know, these are fairly well-understood channels, interest sensitive. And, basically, across the economy, we'd like to slow demand so that it's better aligned with supply; give supply, at the same time, time to recover; and get into a better, you know, a better alignment of supply and demand. And that, over time, should bring inflation down. And I'll say again, though, you know, we don't have a perfect crystal ball about the future, and we're prepared to use our tools as needed to restore price stability. You know, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, without price stability, there-you really can't have a sustained period of maximum employment. It's our-one of our most fundamental obligations is to maintain and restore, in this case, price stability. So we're very committed to that. Of course, the plan is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. That is our intention, and we believe we can do that. But we have to restore price stability. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let's go to Scott Horsley at NPR. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks. And I apologize if this covers some of the same ground you just talked about, Mr. Chair. I think I missed some of your answer there. But I have a follow-up question on the labor force. We have seen some gains in the prime-age workforce in the last few months. I wonder what you anticipate when it comes to some of the older workers as the health outlook has changed. Are we going to see more recent retirees following Tom Brady back into the workforce? And what would that mean for wages and inflation? CHAIR POWELL. It's hard to say. You know, what we saw in the last cycle was that, over the course of a long, steady expansion, labor force participation outperformed expectations. And that was just a, you know, it was a tight labor market, but it wasn't-it was nowhere near as tight as this labor market. But it was a tight labor market, and so people stayed in the labor force longer. It wasn't so much people coming back in the labor force after retirement. That's not something that happens, in the aggregate, very much. But, so that's what was happening. And, you know, more labor force participation is tremendously welcome. And, of course, our policy does not in any way preclude that. This is a situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in a very long time. And people are able to quit their jobs and move to better-paying jobs in the same industry or different industries. So it's a really attractive labor market for people. And once, you know, as we get past COVID well and truly, it becomes an even more attractive one. So we hope that that will lead to more labor supply. That's a good thing for the country. It's a good thing for people. And it also will, we think, help relieve some of the wage pressures that do put inflation more at risk. That last part is, we'll have to see whether, empirically, it winds up, works out that way. But, in principle, it ought to help with inflation as well. It's not the only thing we're looking for, though, from inflation. We're looking for help from a number of different places and, most importantly, from our own policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let's go to Rich Miller at Bloomberg. RICH MILLER. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell. I'm sorry; I'm having some communication problems. So I missed some of the stuff you've said, and my apologies if this has been asked. Since the FOMC met last January, financial conditions have tightened markedly, equity prices down, Treasury yield's up, bond spread's risen, yield curve has flattened a lot, and even further just today, dollar's up. Is that welcome? And would you like to see more in order to achieve your goals? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, policy works through financial conditions. That's how it reaches the real economy-by just the mechanisms you mentioned. And remember that the financial conditions we had for the last couple of years were a function not only of very aggressive, and appropriately so, fiscal policy, but also highly accommodative monetary policy-the monetary policy settings that we put in place at the worst parts of the pandemic. So it is very appropriate to move away from those. And, yes, that will lead to some tightening in financial conditions in the form of higher interest rates and just the sorts of things-we're not targeting any one or more of those things, but financial conditions generally should move to a more normal level so that-because we know the economy no longer needs, or wants, these very highly accommodative, this stance, which, you know, so it's time to move to a more normal setting of financial conditions, and we do that by moving monetary policy itself to more normal levels. RICH MILLER. When you say ""move to a more normal setting"" for financial conditions, that suggests to me that you want financial conditions to tighten further from where we are now. Am I drawing the right inference from that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. So I would say, we look at a broad range of financial conditions. And, of course, when we tighten monetary policy, we do expect that they will adjust in sync over time with monetary policy. It's not any particular financial condition, but a broad range of financial conditions. They will reflect to some extent-they reflect any number of things. But, yes, we need our policy to transmit to the real economy. And it does so through financial conditions, which means that, as we tighten policy or remove accommodation so that it's at least less accommodative, that broader financial conditions will also be less accommodative. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Just a little housekeeping note: Those of you in this call may be having some tech issues. If so, I understand the broadcast is coming through clearly on www.federalreserve.gov. You might go there for the audio. And now we'll go to Jean Yung. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet discussion you had at this meeting. Can you give us any more details? Did you discuss whether to cap runoffs or whether to increase those caps over what period, if there were any details? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. Thank you for asking. So, at our meeting today and yesterday, we made excellent progress toward agreeing on the parameters of a plan to shrink the balance sheet. And I'd say we're now in a position to finalize and implement that plan so that we'll actually begin a runoff at a coming meeting. And that could come as soon as our next meeting in May. That's not a decision that we've made. But I would say that that's how well our discussions went in the last two days. So a couple things just to add. We'll be mindful of the broader financial and economic context when we make the decision on timing, and we always want to use our tools to support macroeconomic and financial stability. We want to avoid adding uncertainty to what's a highly uncertain situation already. So all of that will go into the thinking of the timing around this. In terms of the-I would say this. I don't want to get too much into the details, because we're literally just finalizing them. But the framework is going to look very familiar to people who are familiar with the last time we did this. But it'll be faster than the last time. And, of course, it's much sooner in a cycle than last time. But it will look familiar to you. And I would also say that there'll be-I'm sure there'll be a more detailed discussion of our-in the minutes to our meeting that come out in three weeks, where I expect that it will lay out, you know, pretty much the parameters of what we're looking at, which I think will look quite familiar. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, since September of 2020, you've been operating on a monetary policy framework that let the economy run hot to bring unemployment down. That seems to be over. But I'm wondering how you would describe your reaction function now. What is it that the Fed is trying to do other than bring inflation down? In other words, is it, we're going to keep raising rates until it comes down to an acceptable level? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I want to clear one thing up again. And that is that nothing in our new framework or in the changes that we made has caused us to wait longer to raise interest rates. What we said in the framework changes was-and this was really a reflection of what had happened for the preceding couple of decades, actually. What we said was, if we see, you know, low unemployment, high employment, but we don't see inflation, then we're not going to raise rates 'til we actually see inflation. That's what we said, and that was the sense of it. There was no sense in which, if we got a burst of really high inflation, we would wait to raise rates. That's simply not in the framework. In fact, quite the contrary. The framework is all about anchoring inflation expectations at 2 percent. So I do hear this, you know, that the framework-really, we can't blame the framework. It was a sudden, unexpected burst of inflation. And then it was the reaction to it, and it was what it was. But it was not in any way caused by or related to the framework. So, come to today. You know, I think our vision on this on the Committee is very, very clear. What we see is a strong labor market. We see a labor market with a lot of momentum, great job creation. And we see the underlying economy's strong. Balance sheets are strong. Yes, there are threats to growth from, you know, from what's going on in Eastern Europe. And, but, nonetheless, in the base case, there's a pretty broad expectation of strong growth. But inflation is far above our target. And, you know, the help we've been expecting and other forecasters have been expecting from supply-side improvement, labor force participation, bottlenecks, all those things getting better-it hasn't come. And so we're looking now to using our tools to restore price stability, and we're committed to doing that. And you see that, I think, in the Summary of Economic Projections. And you see that in the decision we make, and you'll continue to see it in the decisions we make, going forward. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up by asking-I guess what you'd call it is the ""Paul Volcker"" question: You don't think unemployment is going to rise significantly, but, if it does, does that temper your desire to keep raising rates? CHAIR POWELL. The goal, of course, is to restore price stability while also sustaining a strong labor market. We have a dual mandate, and they're sort of equal. But, as I said earlier, you know, price stability is an essential goal. In fact, it's a precondition, really, for achieving the kind of labor market that we want, which is a strong and sustained labor market. We saw the benefits of a long expansion, a sustained labor market. It pulled people back in, and there were really no imbalances in the economy that threatened the long expansion. It, just, the pandemic arrived; it was just a completely exogenous event. So that's how we're thinking about it. We, of course, want to achieve, you know, price stability with a strong labor market. But we do understand also that, really, you can't have maximum employment for any sustained period without price stability. So we need to focus on price stability particularly, because the labor market is so strong and the economy is so strong. We feel like the economy can handle tighter monetary policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Hopefully no tech issues here on this front. Wanted to ask just kind of the broad question about how you are communicating what the Fed's doing here today to the average American who might not be reading the dot plots or understanding what the SEP is. How is the 25 basis point hike today and then the signaling on future Fed policy going to address the inflation that they're feeling at the stores on a daily basis? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I guess I'd start by just assuring everyone that we're fully committed to bringing inflation back down and also sustaining the economic expansion. We do understand that these higher prices, no matter what the source, have real effects on people's well-being. And, really, high inflation takes a toll on everyone. But it's really, especially, on people who use most of their income to buy essentials like food, housing, and transportation, where-I mean, we've all seen charts that show, if you're a middle-income person, you've got room to absorb some inflation. If you're at the lower end of the income spectrum, it's very hard because you're spending most of your money already on necessities, and the price is going up. But it's punishing for everyone. So it has been a difficult time for the economy. But we do anticipate that inflation will move back down, as I mentioned earlier. It may take longer than we like, but I'm confident that we'll use our tools to bring inflation down. You asked about rates. So the way that works, I would explain, is, as we raise interest rates, that should gradually slow down demand for the interest-sensitive parts of the economy. And so what we would see is demand slowing down, but just enough so that it's better matched with supply. And that brings-that will bring inflation down over time. That's our plan. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Jo Ling Kent at NBC News. JO LING KENT. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking my question during this today. My question is a follow-up to what Brian just asked. What is your message to consumers out there who can no longer afford the basics due to this high inflation? CHAIR POWELL. Well, that is-yes, indeed. I mean, as I just said, you know, I think we do understand very much, and we very much take to heart, that it's our obligation to restore price stability. And, you know, we've had price stability for a very long time and maybe come to take it for granted. But now we see the pain. I'm old enough to remember what very high inflation was like. And, you know, we're strongly committed as a Committee to not allowing this higher inflation to become entrenched and to use our tools to bring inflation back down to more normal levels, which-our target is 2 percent inflation. So we will do that. And I just would want people to understand that, and that's-but the way we do that is by raising interest rates and by shrinking our balance sheet. And so financial conditions will become, at the margin, less supportive of various kinds of economic activity. That will slow the economy, while also allowing the labor market to remain very strong. And, you know, the good news is, the economy and the labor market are quite strong. And that means the economy, we think, can handle interest rate increases. JO LING KENT. And as a quick follow-up to that, you know, obviously, the Federal Reserve walking this very complicated fine line, trying to avoid a recession. For the consumers out there who are worried about their jobs in a possible recession, what do you say to that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I, you know, I say that our intention is to bring inflation back down to 2 percent, while still sustaining a strong labor market and that the economy is very strong. If you look at where forecasts are, people are forecasting growth that's strong within the context of U.S. potential economic output. So-and we expect that to continue. And to the extent the data come in different, then, of course, our policy will adapt. But we do believe that our policy is the appropriate one for this forecast, and we believe that we can bring down inflation. We believe that we can do so while sustaining a strong labor market. The labor market is-it's not strong in the ordinary sense of the word. We have not seen a labor market where there are 1.7 job openings for every unemployed person or where there, if you add job openings to those who are employed, that's actually substantially a larger number than the size of the workforce, than the number of people who actually count themselves as in the workforce. So this is a situation where demand is higher than supply. And when that happens, prices go up. And they-so we need to use our tools to move supply and demand back. And we don't think we need to do this alone. There will be other factors helping that happen. But we certainly are prepared to use our tools-and we will. JO LING KENT. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Simon at the Economist. SIMON RABINOVITCH. Hi. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Sorry to take you away from inflation for one minute. May I ask about the sanctions on Russia and, specifically, the freezing of the central bank assets? Of course, that raises a similar risk for other sovereigns around the world and their biggest companies, potentially. Any concerns about, in the long term, how this might affect the dollar's status as the preeminent global reserve currency? And in the past couple of weeks, have you had to deliver any kinds of reassurance to other central bankers around the world? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so, of course, central bankers around the world are generally very in favor of these sanctions. But let me say this: Sanctions are really the business of the elected government, and that's true everywhere. So the Administration and the Treasury Department, in particular, and other agencies-they create these sanctions. We're there to provide technical expertise, but they're not, it's not our decisions. And so I'm reluctant to comment on sanctions really much because, again, they're not for us [to decide]. We have a very specific mandate. And these are really the province of elected governments, as I mentioned. So I'd have to leave it at that. Sorry. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking the question. You've been talking a lot about rising wages, which, on the one hand, is a great thing, but are we possibly seeing the beginning of a wage-price spiral? CHAIR POWELL. So the way I would say it is this: We, first of all, I would agree with the premise that wages moving up is a great thing. You know, that's how the standard of living rises over time. And, generally, it's driven over long periods by rising productivity. But what we have now, if you look at these, the wage increases that we have, we look at a-we're blessed with a range of measures of wages that all measure different things. But right now, they're all showing the same thing, which is that the increases-not the levels, but the increases-are running at levels that are well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation, our goal, over time. And that may be-we don't know how persistent that phenomenon will be. It's very hard to say. And that's really, I think, the sense of your question about a wage-price spiral; is that something that's going to start happening and become entrenched in the system? We don't see that. You can see, for example, in some sectors that got very high wage increases early on, those wage increases looked like they may have slowed down to a normal level. But it comes back to, you know, what I'm saying here-which is, there's a misalignment of demand and supply, particularly in the labor market. And that is leading to wages moving up at ways that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And so we need to use our tools to, you know, guide inflation back down to 2 percent. And that would be in the context of an extraordinarily strong labor market. We think this labor market can handle, as I mentioned, tighter monetary policy. And the overall economy can as well. But, yes, wages are moving up faster than is consistent with 2 percent inflation, but it's good to see that moving up. But it wouldn't be sustainable over too long of a period to see them moving up that much higher. And that's because of this misalignment between supply and demand. We expect to get more labor supply. We did last time. We got more than we expected during the last cycle. This time, we've gotten much less than expected. So it's not easy to predict these things. But we do expect that we'll get people coming back in the labor market, particularly as COVID becomes less and less of a factor in many people's lives, something we all wish. But, so that's how we think about it. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we'll go to Don Lee at the L.A. Times. DON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. I think you said to the Senate earlier this month that, in hindsight, the Fed should have moved earlier. And it sounds like today that you don't think that the Fed is late. And, just wanted to get your clarification on that. And if it is, if you still think that the Fed is ""behind the curve,"" how much ""behind the curve"" is it? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So we are not-we don't have the luxury of 20/20 hindsight in actually implementing real-time decisions in the world. So, you know, so the question is-the right question is, did you make the right decisions based on what you knew at the time? But that's not the question I was answering, which is knowing what you know now. So I think if we knew now-of course, if we knew now that these supply blockages, really, and the inflation resulting from them in collision with, you know, very strong demand, if we knew that that was what was going to happen, then in hindsight, yes. It would have been appropriate to move earlier. Obviously, it would be. But, again, we don't have that luxury. And then, so, but that's a separate question from your other question, which is ""behind the curve."" And, you know, I don't have the luxury of looking at it that way. You know, we are, we have our tools-powerful tools-and the Committee is very focused on using them. We're acutely aware of the need to restore price stability while keeping a strong labor market. And what I saw today was a Committee that is strongly committed to achieving price stability, in particular, and prepared to use our tools to do that. We're not going to let high inflation become entrenched. The costs of that would be too high. And we're not going to wait so long that we have to do that. No one wants to have to really put restrictive monetary policy on, in order to get inflation back down. So, frankly, the need is one of getting back up, getting rates back up to more neutral levels as quickly as we practicably can and then moving beyond that, if that turns out to be appropriate. And, as you can see, it is appropriate in the sense that, [in] people's [contributions to the] SEPs, they do write down levels of interest rates that are above their estimate of the longer-run neutral rate. And there's also a range of estimates, too, as you will see if you look at the details of the SEP. But thanks for your question. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you all. Thanks, Mr. Chair. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you."

"NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the unemployment rate at 3.6 percent in March is now essentially at the level that the Committee had expected would prevail over the next three years and at the bottom end of FOMC participants' projections for the longer-run rate that you submitted in the projections at the last meeting. How has your outlook for further declines in the unemployment rate changed since March? What does this imply for your inflation forecast? And how has your level of confidence changed with regard to the feasibility of slowing hiring without pushing the economy into recession? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So you're right-3.6 percent unemployment is just about as low as it's been in 50 years. And I would say that I expect, and Committee members generally expect, that we'll get some additional participation. So people will be coming back into the labor force. We've seen that particularly among prime-age people. And that will, of course, tend to hold the unemployment rate up a little bit. I would also expect, though, that job creation will slow. Job creation has been, you know, more than half a million per month in recent months-very, very strong, particularly for this stage of the economy. And so we think-with fiscal policy less supportive, with monetary policy less supportive, we think that job creation will slow as well. So it is certainly possible that the unemployment would go down further. But so I would expect those to be relatively limited because of the additional supply and also just the slowing in job creation. Implications for inflation-really, the wages matter a fair amount for companies, particularly in the service sector. Wages are running high, the highest they've run in quite some time. And they are one good example, or good illustration, really, of how tight the labor market really is, the fact that wages are running at the highest level in many decades. And that's because of an imbalance between supply and demand in the labor market. So we think through our policies-through further healing in the labor market, higher rates, for example, of vacancy filling and things like that, and more people coming back in-we'd like to think that supply and demand will come back into balance and that, therefore, wage inflation will moderate to still high levels of wage increases, but ones that are more consistent with 2 percent inflation. That's our expectation. Your third question was? NICK TIMIRAOS. Your level of confidence that you can slow hiring without pushing the economy into a downturn. CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say it this way: There's a path. There's a path by which we would be able to have demand moderate in the labor market and therefore have vacancies come down without unemployment going up, because vacancies are at such an extraordinarily high level. There're 1.9 vacancies for every unemployed person, 11.5 million vacancies, 6 million unemployed people. So we haven't been in that place on the vacancy, sort of the vacancy/unemployed curve, the Beveridge curve. We haven't been at that sort of level of a ratio in the modern era. So, in principle, it seems as though by moderating demand, we could see vacancies come down and, as a result-and they could come down fairly significantly and, I think, put supply and demand at least closer together than they are. And that would give us a chance to get inflation down, get wages down, and then get inflation down without having to slow the economy and have a recession and have unemployment rise materially. So there's a path to that. Now, I would say, I think we have a good chance to have a soft or softish landing or outcome, if you will. And I'll give you a couple of reasons for that. One is, households and businesses are in very strong financial shape. You're looking at, you know, excess savings on balance sheets-excess in the sense that they're substantially larger than the prior trend. Businesses are in good financial shape. The labor market is, as I mentioned, very, very strong. And so it doesn't seem to be anywhere close to a downturn. Therefore, the economy is strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy. So, but I'll say, I do expect that this will be very challenging; it's not going to be easy. And it may well depend, of course, on events that are not under our control. But our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome, and that's what we're going to do. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You talked about using 50-basis-point rate hikes or the possibility of them in coming meetings. Might there be something larger than 50? Is 75 or a percentage point possible? And perhaps you could walk us through your calibration. Why one month should-or one meeting should we expect a 50? Why something bigger? Why something smaller? What is the reasoning for the level of the amount of tightening? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So a 75-basis-point increase is not something the Committee is actively considering. What we are doing is, we raised [the funds rate by] 50 basis points today. And we've said that, again, assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations, there's a broad sense on the Committee that additional 50-basis-point increases should be on the table for the next couple of meetings. So we're going to make those decisions at the meetings, of course, and we'll be paying close attention to the incoming data and the evolving outlook as well as to financial conditions. And, finally, of course, we will be communicating to the public about what our expectations will be as they evolve. So the test is really just as I laid it out-economic and financial conditions evolving broadly in line with expectations. And, you know, I think expectations are that we'll start to see inflation, you know, flattening out-and not necessarily declining yet, but we'll see more evidence. We've seen some evidence that core PCE inflation is perhaps either reaching a peak or flattening out. We'll want to know more than just some evidence. We'll want to really feel like we're making some progress there. And we're going to make these decisions, and there'll be a lot more information. I just think we want to see that information as we get there. It's a very difficult environment to try to give forward guidance 60, 90 days in advance. There are just so many things that can happen in the economy and around the world. So, you know, we're leaving ourselves room to look at the data and make a decision as we get there. STEVE LIESMAN. I'm sorry, but if inflation is lower one month and the unemployment rate higher, would that be something that we would calibrate toward a lower increase in the funds rate? CHAIR POWELL. I don't think the one month is-no. No. One month's reading doesn't tell us much. You know, we'd want to see evidence that inflation is moving in a direction that gives us more comfort. As I said, we've got two months now where core inflation is a little lower, but we're not looking at that as a reason to take some comfort. You know, I think we need to really see that our expectation is being fulfilled-that inflation, in fact, is under control and starting to come down. But, again, it's not like we would stop. We would just go back to 25-basis-point increases. It'll be a judgment call when these meetings arrive. But, again, our expectation is, if we see what we expect to see, then we would have 50-basis-point increases on the table at the next two meetings. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Let's go to Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith from the Financial Times. Given the expectation that inflation will remain well above the Fed's target at year-end, what constitutes a neutral policy setting in terms of the fed funds rate? And to what extent is it appropriate for policy to move beyond that level at some point this year? CHAIR POWELL. So-neutral. When we talk about the neutral rate, we're really talking about the rate that neither pushes economic activity higher nor slows it down. So it's a concept, really. It's not something we can identify with any precision. So we estimate it within broad bands of uncertainty. And the current estimates on the Committee are sort of 2 to 3 percent. And also, that's a longer-run estimate. That's an estimate for an economy that's at full employment and 2 percent inflation. So, really, what we're doing is, we're raising rates expeditiously to what we see as the broad range of plausible levels of neutral. But we know that there's not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there. So we're going to be looking at financial conditions, right? Our policy affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy. So we're going to be looking at the effect of our policy moves on financial conditions. Are they tightening appropriately? And then we're going to be looking at the effects on the economy. And we're going to be making a judgment about whether we've done enough to get us on a path to restore price stability. It's that. So if that path happens to involve levels that are higher than estimates of neutral, then we will not hesitate to go to those levels. We won't. But, again, there's a sort of false precision in the discussion that we as policymakers don't really feel. You know, you're going to raise rates, and you're going to be kind of inquiring how that is affecting the economy through financial conditions. And, of course, if higher rates are required, then we won't hesitate to deliver them. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Do you see evidence that inflationary psychology is changing in areas like workers' wage demands, businesses' willingness to raise prices? Do you see evidence that there is a psychological shift going on on inflation? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. We don't really see strong evidence of that yet, but that does not in any way make us comfortable. I think if you look at short-term inflation expectations, they're quite elevated. And you can look at that and say, ""Well, that's because people expect inflation to come down."" And, in fact, inflation expectations [at longer horizons] come down fairly sharply. Longer-term inflation expectations have been reasonably stable but have moved up to-but only to levels where they were in 2014, by some measures. So you can look at that. And I think that's a fair description of the picture. But it's really about the risks. We don't see a wage-price spiral. We see that companies have the ability to raise prices, and they're doing that, but there have been price shocks. So I just think it takes you back to the basic point-was that we know we need to expeditiously move our policy rate up to ranges of more normal, neutral levels. And we need to look around and keep going if we don't see that financial conditions have tightened adequately or that the economy is behaving in ways that suggest that we're not where we need to be. So, again, you don't see those things yet, but I would say there's no basis for feeling comfortable about that. It's a risk that we simply can't run. We can't allow a wage-price spiral to happen. And we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored. It's just something that we can't allow to happen, and so we'll look at it that way. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Great. Thanks, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. You mentioned in the statement both the upside risks to inflation from Russia and China. Obviously, those are very much supply shocks rather than demand side. And I wonder what you meant to convey by adding them-I wonder what you meant to convey by adding those. CHAIR POWELL. Well. So our tools don't really work on supply shocks. Our tools work on demand. And to the extent we can't affect, really, oil prices or other commodity prices or food prices and things like that, so we can't affect those. But there's a job to do on demand. And that-you can see that in the labor market, where demand is substantially in excess of supply of workers. And you can see it in the product markets as well. But I guess I'm just pointing out that-a couple of things. For both the situation in Ukraine and the situation in China, they're likely to, both, add to headline inflation. And people are going to be suffering from that, you know. People almost suffer more from food and energy shocks then, but-even though they don't actually tell us much about the future path. So the second thing is that they're both capable of preventing further progress in supply chains healing or even making supply chains temporarily worse. So they're going to weigh on the process of global supply chain healing, which is going to affect broader inflation, too. So, in a way, they're two further negative shocks that have hit really in the last, you know, 60 days, 90 days. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida from Politico. I want to follow up on that, because you all have obviously highlighted that there are both supply and demand issues at play in inflation. And I'm just wondering, you know, if these supply chain issues continue because of Russia, because of China, or just because these things take a while to work out, does getting back down to your 2 percent mandate require that the supply chain issues get resolved, since you can only handle the demand side, as you said? Or will you have to crimp demand maybe even further if the supply chain issues don't resolve themselves, in order to try and get inflation back down to where you want it to be? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, I'll just say: For now, we're focused on doing the job we need to do on demand, and there's plenty to be done there. Again, if you look at it, it's essentially almost two to one, job vacancies to unemployed people. There's a lot of excess demand. There're more than 5 million more employed plus job openings than there are the size of the labor force. So there's an imbalance there that we have to do our work on. A very difficult situation-you know, you would look at core inflation, which wouldn't include the commodity price shocks. And, you know, that's one of the reasons we would tend to focus on that, because we can have more of an effect on that, but it would be a very difficult situation. I mean, we have to be sure that inflation expectations remain anchored. And I mean, that's part of our job, too, so we'd be watching that carefully. And it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. And thanks, and nice to be back. So two questions. One quick one. You've cited the 1.9 to 1 figure so often now, I've got to ask you, what would be a good figure there? What would you like to see that come down to to think that you're in sort of a noninflationary vacancy-to-unemployed rate? And, secondly, on help from inflation, how much are you counting on wealth effects through stock market channels? Equity markets broadly down quite a bit since late fall, first of the year-how are you mapping that into household consumption? Have they come down enough? Do you need another leg down in equity values to think that households are going to stop spending at the rate we need them to stop spending? CHAIR POWELL. Okay, so in terms of the vacancies-to-unemployment ratio, we don't have a goal in mind. There's no specific number that we're saying, ""We've got to get to that."" It's really, you've got to get to a place where the labor market appears to be more in balance. And that depends not only on the level of those things-it also, it depends on how well the matching functions in the labor markets are working. Because, you know, the longer these expansions go on, you can get very efficient with all of that, and the Beveridge curve shifts out. And that also tends to, you know, to help. So there isn't a specific number. I will say we were-you know, I think, I think when we got to one-to-one in the, you know, in the late teens, we thought that was a pretty good number. But, again, we're not shooting for any particular number. What we'd like to see is progress, but we're not really looking at that. That's an intermediate variable. We're looking at wages, and we're looking at, ultimately, inflation. So, you know, there are a bunch of channels through which policy works. You can think of it as, you know, interest-sensitive spending, and then you can think of another big one as asset values broadly. And, you know, there're big models with, you know, a lot of different channels that are related to that. You know, we don't focus on any one market-the equity market or the housing market-we focus on financial conditions broadly. So we wouldn't be targeting any one market, as you suggest, for going up or down or taking a view on whether it's at a good level or a bad level. We just would be looking at very broad measures of financial conditions-all the different financial conditions indexes, for example, which include equity. But they also include debt and other, many other things-credit spreads, things like that-too. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel here from the Washington Post. To follow up from your message from the very beginning, what is your message to the American people about when they will start to feel the effects of, say, a 50-basis-point rate hike or multiple hikes? How do you explain to them what that does to their grocery bill or their rent or their gas bill? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, first, the first thing to say is that we understand. And some of us are old enough to have lived through high inflation, and many aren't. But it's very unpleasant. It's just something people don't-when they experience it for the first time, you're paying more for the same thing. If you're a normal economic person, then you probably don't have that much extra to spend. And it's immediately hitting your spending on groceries, on, you know, on gasoline, on energy, and things like that. So we understand the pain involved. So how do you get out of that? And it's our job to make sure that inflation of that unpleasant, high nature doesn't get entrenched in the economy. That's what we're here for, one of the main things we're here for-perhaps the most fundamental thing we're here for. And the way we do that is, we try to get supply and demand back in sync with each other, back in balance, so that the economy is under less stress and inflation will go down. Now, the process of getting there involves higher rates-so higher mortgage rates, higher borrowing rates, and things like that. So it's not going to be pleasant either. But in the end, everyone is better off. Everyone- particularly people on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices. And so we need to do everything we can to restore stable prices. We'll do it as quickly and effectively as we can. We think we have a good chance to do it without a significant increase in unemployment or, you know, a really sharp slowdown. But, ultimately, we think about the medium and longer term, and everyone will be better off if we can get this job done-the sooner, the better. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with the Fox Business Network. So you've talked in the past about consumer spending and how that drives the economy. Are you concerned, with this high level of inflation, that the consumer will stop spending-and what's the level of your concern-pushing us into a recession? CHAIR POWELL. So the economy is doing fairly well. We expect growth to be solid this year. And we see, you know, household spending and business investment as fairly strong-and even in the first quarter, which was relatively slow on some other fronts. So, and the labor market-if you look at the labor market, for people who are out of work and looking, there are lots of job opportunities for-wages are moving up and at rates that haven't been seen in quite a long time. So it's a good time to be a worker looking to, you know, either change jobs or get a wage increase in your current job. So it's a strong economy, and nothing about it suggests that it's close to, or vulnerable to, a recession. Now, of course, given events around the world and fading fiscal policy effects and higher rates, you could see some slower economic activity. Certainly, it will not be-last year was an extraordinarily strong growth year as we recovered from the pandemic. As I mentioned, growth [was] over 5 percent. But most forecasters have growth this year at, you know, at a solid pace above 2 percent. EDWARD LAWRENCE. But we've talked with economists who have advised Democrats and Republican Presidents who both said that the Fed is so far behind the curve on inflation that a recession is inevitable. CHAIR POWELL. So, and as I said, I think we have a good chance to restore price stability without a recession-without, you know, a severe downturn; without materially high, higher unemployment. And I mentioned the reasons for that. So I see a strong economy now. I see a very strong labor market, for example. Businesses can't find the people to hire-they can't find them. So, typically, in a recession, you would have unemployment. Now you have surplus demand. So there should be room, in principle, to reduce that surplus demand without putting people out of work. The issue will come that we don't have precision surgical tools. We have, essentially, interest rates, the balance sheet, and forward guidance, and they're famously blunt tools. They're not capable of surgical precision. So I would agree. No one thinks this will be easy, no one thinks it's straightforward, but there is certainly a plausible path to this, and I do think we've got a good chance to do that. And, you know, our job is not to rate the chances-it is to try to achieve it. So that's what we're doing. There are a range of opinions, though, and that's only appropriate. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve Dorsey. STEVE DORSEY. Thanks. Steve Dorsey, CBS. You mentioned earlier, just now, fading fiscal policy. Do you feel that the Fed has been supported enough from policies at the White House and in Congress in combating inflation? CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's really the Fed that has responsibility for price stability. And we take whatever arrives at the Fed in terms of fiscal activity, we take it as a given, and we don't evaluate it-it's not our job, really. We don't have an oversight function there. And we look at it as our job, given all the factors that are happening, to try to sustain maximum employment and price stability. So if Congress or the Administration has ways to help with inflation, I would encourage that, but I'm not going to get into making recommendations or anything like that. It's not, it's really not our role-we need to stay in our lane and do our job. When we get inflation back under control, then maybe I can, you know, give other people advice [laughter]. Right now, we need to focus on, just focus on doing our job. And I'll stick to that. Stick in our lane. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve Matthews. STEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg News. A number of your colleagues have said that the rates will need to go above neutral into a restrictive territory to bring down inflation. One, do you agree with that? And, two, you've recently spoken in great praise of Paul Volcker, who had the courage to bring inflation down with recessions in the 1980s. And while it's certainly not your desire-the soft landing is the big hope of everyone-would this FOMC have the courage to endure recessions to bring inflation down if that were the only way necessary? CHAIR POWELL. So I think it's certainly possible that we'll need to move policy to levels that we see as restrictive as opposed to just neutral. We can't know that today. That decision is not in front of us today. If we do conclude that we need to do that, then we won't hesitate to do it. I'll say again, there's no bright line, you know, that you're stepping over. You're really looking at what our policy stance is and what the market is forecasting for it. You're looking at financial conditions and how that's affecting the economy and making a judgment. You know, we won't be arguing about whose model of the neutral rate is better than the other one. It's much more about a practical application of our policy tools. And we're absolutely prepared to do that. It-wouldn't hesitate if that's what it takes. So I am, of course-who isn't an admirer of Paul Volcker? I shouldn't be singled out in this respect. But I knew him just a little bit and have tremendous admiration for him. And I-But I would phrase it this way: He had the courage to do what he thought was the right thing. That's what it was. It wasn't a particular thing. It was that he always did-he always did-what he thought was the right thing. If you read his last autobiography, that really comes through. So that's [what] the test is. It isn't, will we do one particular thing? I would say, we do see, though-we see restoring price stability as absolutely essential for the country in coming years. Without price stability, the economy doesn't work for anybody, really. And so it's really essential, particularly for the labor market. If you think about it, like if you look at the last cycle, we had a very, very-longest expansion cycle in our recorded history. In the last two, three years, you had the benefits of this tight labor market going to people in the lower quartiles. And it was, you know, racial, wealth, and income-not wealth, but income gaps were coming down, wage gaps. So it's a really great thing. We'd all love to get back to that place. But to get back to anything like that place, you need price stability. So, basically, we've been hit by historically large inflationary shocks since the pandemic. This isn't anything like regular business. This is, we have a pandemic, we have the highest unemployment, you know, in-since the Depression. Then we have this outsized response from fiscal policy and monetary policy. Then we have inflation. Then we have a war in Ukraine, which is cutting the commodity, you know, patch in half. And now we have these shutdowns in China. So it's been a series of inflationary shocks that are really different from anything people have seen in 40 years. So we have to look through that and look at the economy that's coming out the other side. And we need to somehow find price stability out of this. And it's obviously going to be very challenging, I think, because you do have, you know, numerous supply shocks, which are famously difficult to deal with. So I guess that's how I think about it. MICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Earlier, you just said that if necessary-I think were the words-that you would, or if it, if it turned out to be necessary, or you said that it's possible that we'll need to move policy to restrictive levels. Given where inflation is and the hot economy is-or, certainly, the hot labor market, as you described it-why still the hesitation? I mean, what else do you need to see in order to determine that? Wouldn't the Fed naturally be looking to go to a restrictive level at this point? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I didn't-if I said ""necessary,"" I meant to say ""appropriate."" We're not going to be erecting a high barrier for this. It's more, if we think it's appropriate. You know, the point is, we're a very long way from neutral now. We're moving there expeditiously, and we'll continue to do so. And we can't make that decision, really, today. The decision for about how high to go will be on the table to be made when we reach neutral. And, you know, I expect we'll get there expeditiously, as I've mentioned. So it's not that we don't want to-making that decision today wouldn't really mean anything. But I'll say again, if we do believe that it's appropriate to go to those levels, we won't hesitate. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mike McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. The balance sheet-why did you decide to wait until June 1st to begin letting securities roll off and not immediately start in the middle of this month, say? And do you have another, a newer or a better, estimate for the monetary policy impact of letting the balance sheet decline? And then, finally, I'm just curious why you felt the need to address the American people at the top of your remarks? Are you concerned about Fed credibility with the American people? CHAIR POWELL. So, why June 1? It was just, pick a date, you know, and that happened to be the date that we picked. It was-nothing magic about it. You know, it's not going to have any macroeconomic significance over time. We just picked that. Sometimes we publish these calendars on the first day of the month, and that's what we're doing. I wouldn't read anything into it. In terms of the effect, I mean, I would just stress how uncertain the effect is of shrinking the balance sheet. You know, we run these models-and everyone does in this field-and make estimates of what will be, how do you measure, you know, a certain quantum of balance sheet shrinkage compared to quantitative easing? And, you know, these are very uncertain. I really can't be any clearer. There won't be any clearer [estimates]. You know, people estimate that, broadly, on the path we're on-and this will be taken, probably, too seriously-but sort of Â¼ percent, one rate increase over the course of a year at this pace. But I would just say, with very wide uncertainty bands-very wide. We don't really know. There are other estimates that are much smaller than that, by the way. And some of you may read about that. That's kind of a mainstream estimate. We know that it is part of returning to more normal, more neutral financial conditions. And, you know, our strategy is to set up a plan and have it operate and really have, you know, have the interest rate be the active tool of monetary policy. In terms of speaking to the American people, so I feel like sometimes I just want to remind us, really, that that's who we work for, and that it's inflation that people are feeling all over the country. And it's very important that they know that we know how painful it is and that we are working hard on fixing it. I thought it was quite important to do that. And so that was really the thinking behind that. MICHAEL MCKEE. Do you think the Fed has a credibility problem? CHAIR POWELL. No, I don't. And a good example of why would be-in the fourth quarter of last year, as we started talking about tapering sooner and then raising rates this year, you saw financial markets reacting, you know, very appropriately. Not to bless any particular day's measure, but the way financial markets, the forward rate curve has tightened in response to our guidance and our actions really amplifies our policy. It's-monetary policy is working through expectations now, to a very large extent. We've only done two rate increases. But if you look at financial conditions, the two-year [rate] is at 280 [basis points] now. In September, I think it was at 20 basis points. And that's all through the economy. People are feeling those higher rates already. And so that shows that the markets think that our forward guidance is credible. And I think we want to keep it that way. MICHELLE SMITH. Scott Horsley. [No response] Okay. Brian Cheung. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. To expand on Steve's question about Paul Volcker, there was also a great pain that came with that as well-higher interest rates, obviously affecting households and businesses. I'm wondering how you kind of square what might be demand disruption. Are you already seeing that? Is the idea here to incentivize a lack of spending, to decrease consumption, to perhaps table business investments? Is that essentially what's happening through this hiking cycle? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Well, so, as I mentioned, you can see places where the demand is substantially in excess of supply. And what you're seeing as a result of that is prices going up and at unsustainable levels, levels that are not consistent with 2 percent inflation. And so what our tools do is that as we raise interest rates, demand moderates: it moves down. Interest rates, you know-businesses will invest a little bit less, consumers will spend a little bit less. That's how it works. But, ultimately, getting those, getting supply and demand back, you know, back in balance, is what gives us 2 percent inflation, which is what gives the economy a footing where people can lead successful economic lives and not worry about inflation. I mean, so, yes, there may be some pain associated with getting back to that. But, you know, the big pain over time is in not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become entrenched. MICHELLE SMITH. Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I was wondering if you could take a step back and talk about, in March the dot plot had, you know, looked like steady quarter-point rate hikes, get the funds rate up to 2 percent at the end of the year. Now-where it seems like you're much more aggressive. So could you talk about the thinking that's behind that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, look, I think what you've seen is-really, I would say, in the middle of last fall-there was a time when our policy stance was still pretty much in sync with what the data were saying. If you remember, there were a couple of weak jobs reports. And inflation-month by month, inflation had come down till September, a few months in a row, stayed low. And then around the end of October, we got three or four really strong readings that just said, no, this is a much stronger economy. And by the way-then, with the restatement of the jobs numbers, it looked like the job market was much more even and stronger in the second half of the year. But that hadn't happened yet. Anyway, we got an ECI reading-employment compensation, [employment cost] index reading-the Friday before the November meeting. Then we got a really strong jobs report. Then we got a really high CPI report. And so I think it became clear to the Committee that we needed to adjust and adapt. And we have. Ever since then, really ever since then, we've been adapting. We, you know-the Committee moved by the time of the December meeting to a median [in participants' 2022 projections] of three rate increases, then to a median of seven increases at the March meeting. And that process is going on. And it's clearly continuing. And that's why I say-and I actually mentioned this at the March meeting-that no one should look at any single SEP as sort of a real resting place for 90 days, because we're in a fast-evolving situation. And that's what's happened. You can see-unanimous vote today, of course. And I told you the guidance-that broad support on the Committee to have 50-basis-point hikes on the table at the next couple of meetings. So you're right. And by the way, other forecasters have been doing the same thing. And it's just us adapting to the data and to the situation and using our tools to deal with it. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We'll go to Nancy for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I want to ask how you're able to balance your dual mandate-stable prices and maximum employment-especially when the unemployment rate for Black workers is still roughly double, roughly twice the rate for white workers. CHAIR POWELL. So unemployment rates for all racial groups have come down a lot and are now much closer to where they were before the pandemic hit. So that's one thing I would say. And that's important. But the bigger point is this: I do not, at this time, see the two sides of the mandate as in tension. I don't, because you can see that the labor market is out of balance. You can see that there's a labor shortage. There aren't enough people to fill these job openings. And companies can't hire, and wages are moving up at levels that would not, over time, be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. And, of course, everyone loves to see wages go up. And it's a great thing, but you want them to go up at a sustainable level, because these wages are, to some extent, being eaten up by inflation. So, what that really means is, to get the kind of labor market we really want to get, we really want to have a labor market that serves all Americans, especially the people in the lower-income part of the distribution, especially them. To do that, you've got to have price stability. And we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion, too. That's-the good things you can have, as we have. We've had-several of the longest expansions in U.S. history have been in the last 40 years, and that's because it's been a time of low inflation. And long expansions are good for people and good for the labor market. So that's the way I think about it. I think we-you know, our tools work. We have to think in the, in the medium and longer term. And I do think that the best thing for everyone is for us to get back to price stability to support, really, a sustained period of strong labor market conditions. Thanks very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Two related questions. Chair Powell, do you feel you boxed yourself in with the language you used at the last press conference on 50 basis point hikes in June and July? And would you please give us as detailed a sense as you can of what role you played in reshaping market expectations so quickly on Monday? CHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, we always aim to provide as much clarity as we can about our policy intentions subject to the inherent uncertainty in the economic outlook, because we think monetary policy is more effective when market participants understand how policy will evolve, when they understand our objective function, our reaction function. And in the current highly unusual circumstances with inflation well above our goal, we think it's helpful to provide even more clarity than usual-again, subject to uncertainty in the outlook. And I think over the course of this year, financial markets have responded and have, generally, shown that they understand the path we're laying out. Of course, it remains data dependent. And so that's what we generally think about guidance, and that's why we offer it. And, of course, when we offered that-when I offered that guidance at the last meeting, I did say that it was subject to the economy performing about in line with expectations. I also said that if the economy performed-if data came in worse than expected, then we would consider moving even more aggressively. So we got the CPI data and also some data on inflation expectations late last week, and we thought for a while, and we thought, well, this is the appropriate thing to do. So then the question is, what do you do? And do you wait six weeks to do it at the next meeting? And I think the answer is, that's not where we are with this. So we decided we needed to go ahead, and so we did. And that's really-that's really how we made the decision. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. You-I guess I wonder if you could describe for us a little bit how you're deciding how aggressive you need to be. So, obviously, 75 today. What did 75 achieve that 50 wouldn't have, and why not just go for a full percentage point at some point? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So if you take a step back, what we're looking for is compelling evidence that inflationary pressures are abating and that inflation is moving back down. And we'd like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings-that's what we're looking for. And, by this point, we had actually been expecting to see clear signs of at least inflation flattening out and, ideally, beginning to decline. We've said that we'd be data dependent, focused on incoming data, highly attentive to inflation risks-the things that I mentioned to Howard moments ago. So contrary to expectations, inflation again surprised to the upside. Indicators-some indicators of inflation expectations have risen, and projections of [inflation] this year have moved up notably. So we thought that strong action was warranted at this meeting, and today we delivered that in the form of a 75 basis point rate hike, as I mentioned. So the point of it, really, is this: We've been moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and over the course of the seven months since we pivoted and began moving in this direction, we've seen financial conditions tighten, and appropriately so. But the federal funds rate, even after this move, is at 1.6 percent. So, again, the Committee is moving rates up expeditiously to more normal levels, and we came to the view that we'd like to do a little more front-end loading on that. So I think that the SEP gives you the levels that people think are appropriate at given points in time. This was really about the speed in which we would get there. So, as I mentioned, 75 basis points today-I said the next meeting could well be about a decision between 50 and 75. That would put us, at the end of the July meeting, in that range-in that more normal range, and that's a desirable place to be, because you begin to have more optionality there about the speed with which you would proceed going forward. Just talking about the SEP for a second: What it really says is that Committee participants widely would like to see policy at a modestly restricted-restrictive level at the end of this year. And that's six months from now, and so much data [can accrue] and so much can happen, so remember how highly uncertain this is. But so that is generally a range of 3 to 3Â½ percent. That's where people are, and that's what they want to see, knowing what they know now and understanding that we need to be-we need to show resolve but also be flexible [in responding] to incoming data as we see it. If things are better, we don't need to do that much, and if they're not, then we either do that much or possibly even more. But in any case, it will be very data dependent. Then you're looking at next year, and what you're seeing is, people see more-a bit more tightening and a range of maybe 3Â½ to 4 percent. And that's generally what people see as the appropriate path for getting inflation under control and starting back down and getting back down to 2 percent. So 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting, and that's what we did. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You have not used the phrase in a long time ""monetary policy is in a good place,"" which is a phrase that you used to use often. Now that the Committee is projecting 4 percent on a-or 3.8 percent next year in terms of the funds rate, which is similar to where the market is now, the futures market of 4 percent funds rate next year, do you think that's a level that is going to be sufficiently high enough to deal with and bring down the inflation problem? And just as a follow-up, could you break that apart for me? How much of that is restrictive, and how much of that is a normal positive rate that ought to be embedded or not, in your opinion, in the funds rate? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the question really is, how high does the rate really need to go? And this is-the estimates on the Committee are in that range of 3Â½ to 4 percent. And how do you think about that? Well, you can think about the longer-run neutral rate, you can compare it to that, and we think that's in the mid-2s. You can look, frankly, at broader financial conditions. You can look at asset prices, you can look at the effect they're having on the economy, rates, asset prices, credit spreads-all of those things go into that. You can also look at the yield curve and ask, all along the yield curve, where is the policy rate? So for much of the yield curve now, real rates are positive. That's not true at the short end. At the short end of the yield curve in the early years, you don't have real-you have negative rates still. So that really is one data point-it's one part of financial conditions. So I think-I have to look at it this way: We move the policy rate. That affects financial conditions. And that affects the economy. We have, of course, ways-rigorous ways to think about it, but, ultimately, it comes down to, do we think financial conditions are in a place where they're having the desired effect on the economy? And that desired affect is, we'd like to see demand moderating. Demand is very hot still in the economy. We'd like to see the labor market getting better in balance between supply and demand, and that can happen [as a result of developments coming] both from supply and demand. Right now, there's-demand is substantially higher than available supply, though, so we feel that there's a role for us in moderating demand. Those are the things we can affect with our policy tools. There are many things we can't affect, and those would be, you know, the things-the commodity price issues that we're having around the world due to the war in Ukraine and the fallout from that, and also just all of the supply-side things that are still pushing upward on inflation. So that's really how I think-how I think about it. STEVE LIESMAN. But does 3.8 percent, 4 percent get it done? Does it get the job done on breaking the back of inflation? CHAIR POWELL. I think it's certainly in the range of plausible numbers. I think we'll know when we get there really. I mean, honestly, though, that would be-you would have positive real rates, I think, and inflation coming down by then. I think you'd have positive real rates across the [yield] curve. I think that the neutral rate is pretty low these days. So I would think it would, but you know what? We're going to find that out empirically. We're not going to be completely model driven about this. We're going to be looking at this, keeping our eyes open, and reacting to incoming data both on financial conditions and on what's happening in the economy. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos. Chair Powell, you've said that you like your policy to work through expectations. And now, obviously, this decision was something quite different from how you and almost all of your colleagues had set those expectations during the intermeeting period. And I know you just said that what changed was really the inflation data-the inflation expectations data. But I'm wondering, on the inflation expectations data, was there something you saw that was unsettling enough to risk eroding the credibility of your verbal guidance by doing something so different from what you had ""socialized"" before? CHAIR POWELL. So if you look at a broad range of inflation expectations-so you've got the public, you've got surveys of the public and of experts, and you've also got market based. And I think if you look across that broad range of data, what you see is that expectations are still in the place, very much in the place, where short-term inflation is going to be high but comes down sharply over the next couple of years. And that's really where inflation expectations are. And also, as you get away from this episode, they get back down close to 2 percent. And so this is really very important to us-that that remain the case. And I think if you look for most measures, most of the time, that's what you see. If we even see a couple of indicators that bring that into question, we take that very seriously. We do not take this for granted-we take it very seriously. So the preliminary Michigan [survey] reading-it's a preliminary reading; it might be revised-nonetheless, it was quite eye-catching, and we noticed that. We also noticed that the index of common inflation expectations at the Board has moved up after being pretty flat for a long time, so we're watching that, and we're thinking, ""this is something we need to take seriously."" And that is one of the factors, as I mentioned-one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations. We're absolutely determined to keep them anchored at 2 percent. That was one of the reasons-the other was just the CPI reading. NICK TIMIRAOS. So if you saw a movement like that again, another tick-up in inflation expectations, would that put a 75 or even 100 basis point increase in play at your next meeting? CHAIR POWELL. We're going to-I'll just say, we're going to react to the incoming data and appropriately, I think. So I wouldn't want to put a number on what that might be. The main thing is to get rates up, and then pretty soon, we'll be in an area where we're-I think as you get closer to the end of the year, you're in a range where you've got restrictive policy, which is appropriate. Forty-year highs in inflation-we think that policy is going to need to be restrictive, and we don't know how restrictive. So I think that's how we'll take it. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. Thanks for taking our questions. The late-breaking kind of decision to go to 75 basis points-do you worry that that will make policy guidance a less effective tool in the future? And should we think of that as a kind of symmetrical reaction function if we start to get soft readings on inflation or if the labor market starts to roll over? CHAIR POWELL. To take your second question first, yes. I mean, I think we're-again, we're going, we're resolved to take this on, but we're going to be flexible in the implementation of it. Sorry-and your [first] question was [about] guidance. So, again, the overall exercise is that we try to be-provide as much clarity about our policy intentions as we can, because we think that makes monetary policy work better. There's always a tradeoff, because you have to live with that guidance, and so you do it, and it helps a lot of the time. I, frankly, think this year has been a demonstration of how well it can work. With us having really just done very little in the way of raising interest rates, financial conditions have tightened quite significantly through the expectations channel, as we've made it clear what our plans are. So I think that's been a very healthy thing to be happening. And I would hope that our-it's always going to be-any guidance that we give is always going to be subject to things working out about as we expect. And, in this particular situation, you know, we're looking for something specific, and that is progress on inflation. We want to see progress. We want to see-inflation can't go down until it flattens out, and that's what we're looking to see. And if we don't see that, then that's the kind of thing that will-even if we don't see progress for a longer period, that could cause us to react. But we will. Soon enough, we will be seeing some progress at some point. And we'll react [as] appropriate to that, too. But I would like to think, though, that our guidance is still credible, but it's always going to be conditional on what happens. This is an unusual situation, to get, you know, some data late in, during blackout, pretty close to-very close to our meeting. Very unusual to [have] one that would actually change the outcome. So I've only seen-in my 10-years-plus here at the Fed, I've only seen something like that, even close to that, one or two times. So I don't think it's something that'll come up a great deal. MICHELLE SMITH. Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the ""clear and convincing"" threshold for the inflation trajectory, what is the level of realized inflation that meets that criteria? And how is the Committee thinking about the potential tradeoff of much higher unemployment than even in what's forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at this acceptable pace? CHAIR POWELL. The second part I didn't get. COLBY SMITH. What's the potential tradeoff with higher unemployment than even what's forecasted in the SEP if inflation is not moderating at an acceptable pace? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So, what we want to see is a series of declining monthly readings for inflation, and we'd like to see inflation headed down. But, you know-and right now, our policy rate is well below neutral, right? So, soon enough, we'll have our policy rate-let's assume the world works out about like the SEP says: The policy rate will be up where we think it should be. And then the question would be: Do you slow down? Does it make you-you'll be making these judgments about, is it appropriate now to slow down-from 50 to 25, let's say-or speed up? So that's the kind of thinking we'll be doing, and, again, we're looking-ultimately, we're not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down. And that's what I mean by-that's what it would take for us to say, ""Okay, we think this job is done."" Because we saw-and, frankly, we saw last year-inflation came down over the course of the summer and then turned right around and went back up. So I think we're going to be careful about declaring victory. But our-again, the implementation of our policy is going to be flexible and sensitive to incoming data. COLBY SMITH. Are you more concerned now that to bring down inflation, it's going to require more than just some pain at this point? CHAIR POWELL. Again, I think that-I do think that our objective, and this is what's reflected in the SEP, but our objective, really, is to bring inflation down to 2 percent while the labor market remains strong. I think that what's becoming more clear is that many factors that we don't control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that's possible or not. And there I'm thinking, of course, of commodity prices, the war in Ukraine, supply chain [developments], things like that, where we really-the monetary policy stance doesn't affect those things. But having said that, there is a path for us to get there-it's not getting easier; it's getting more challenging because of these external forces-and that path is to move demand down, and you have a lot of surplus demand. Take, for example, in the labor market. So you have two job vacancies, essentially, for every person actively seeking a job, and that has led to a real imbalance in wage negotiating. You could get to a place where that ratio was at a more normal level, and you wouldn't-you would expect to see those wage pressures move back down to a level where people are still getting healthy wage increases, real wage increases, but at a level that's consistent with 2 percent inflation. So that's a possibility. And you could say the same thing about some of the product markets where there's just excess capacity and really where the strong demand has gone into-sorry, where they're capacity constrained, right? So you have, effectively, what we think of as a vertical supply curve or close to it. So demand comes in, and it's very strong, and it shows up in higher prices-not higher quantities, not more cars, because they can't make the cars because they don't have the semiconductors. So in principle, that could work in reverse. When demand comes down, you could see-and it's not guaranteed-but you could see prices coming down more than the typical economic relationships that you see in the textbooks would suggest, because of the unusual situation we're in on the supply side. So there's a pathway there. It is not going to be easy, and there-again, it's our objective, but, as I mentioned, it's going to depend to some extent on factors we don't control. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. So the new projections show the unemployment rate ticking up through 2024. Is a higher unemployment rate necessary in order to combat inflation? And what is lost if the unemployment rate has to go up and people lose their jobs in order to control inflation? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So you're right. In the SEP, we have unemployment going up to 4 point-the median is 4.1 percent-of course, [there is] a range of actual forecasts. And I would characterize that, if you were to get inflation down to, you know, on its way down to 2 percent and the unemployment rate went up to 4.1 percent, that's still a historically low level. We hadn't seen-we hadn't seen rates, unemployment rates below 4 percent until a couple years ago for-we'd seen it for, like, one year in the last 50. So the idea that-3.6 percent is historically low in the last century. So a 4.1 percent unemployment rate with inflation well on its way to 2 percent-I think that would be-I think that would be a successful outcome. So we're not looking to have a higher unemployment rate. But I would say that I would certainly look at that as a successful outcome. RACHEL SIEGEL. Would that include people losing their jobs? CHAIR POWELL. We're not-again, we're not, we don't seek to put people out of work, of course. We never think, ""Too many people are working, and fewer people need to have jobs."" But we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability. And we have to go back and establish price stability so we can have that kind of labor market, and that's a labor market where workers are getting wage increases-maybe the workers at the lower end of the spectrum are getting the biggest wage increases, as they were before the pandemic-where participation is high, where there's lots of job opportunities, where it's just a really-I mean, the labor market we had before the pandemic was-that's what we want to get back to. And you see disparities between various groups at historic lows. We'd love to get back to that place. But, to get there-it's not going to happen with the levels of inflation we have. So we have to restore that, and it really is in service, in the medium and longer term, of the kind of labor market we want and hope to achieve. MICHELLE SMITH. Matt. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg. So, as you just mentioned, the Committee is now projecting a Â½ percentage point rise in the unemployment rate and the SEPs over the next couple of years, and it removed a line from its policy statement about thinking that the labor market can remain strong while it tightens policy. You just mentioned that that is still your objective, though, so I'm wondering if you could explain why that line was removed from the statement-also whether this means the FOMC is trying to induce a recession now to bring inflation down. CHAIR POWELL. Not trying to induce a recession now. Let's be clear about that. We're trying to achieve 2 percent inflation consistent with a strong labor market. That's what we're trying to do. So let me talk about that sentence. Clearly, it's our goal to bring about 2 percent inflation while keeping the labor market strong, right? And that's kind of what the SEP says. The SEP has inflation getting down to 2, a little above 2 percent in 2024, with unemployment at 4.1 percent. And this is a strong labor market-this is a good labor market. And, as I mentioned, there are pathways to do it. But those pathways have become much more challenging due to factors that are not under our control. Again, thinking here of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which has brought a spike in prices of energy, food, fertilizer, industrial chemicals, and also just the supply chains more broadly, which have been larger and longer lasting than anticipated. So the sentence that we deleted said that we believe that appropriate monetary policy, effectively alone, can bring about the result of 2 percent inflation with a strong labor market. And so much of it is really not down to monetary policy. It just didn't-the sentence isn't-it kind of says on its face that monetary policy alone can do this. And that's not-that just didn't seem appropriate, so we took the sentence out. MATTHEW BOESLER. And given the new projections for the unemployment rate, could you talk a little bit about what accounts for such reduced confidence against, say, a month ago or three months ago that inflation will largely normalize on its own as these supply-side issues get worked out? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Well, yeah, I think you've seen-again, we've been expecting progress, and we didn't get that. We got sort of the opposite. So I also think the situation, really-since the consequences of the Ukraine war become more and more clear, what you're seeing is the situation getting more difficult. And you look around the world-I mean, lots of countries are-lots of countries are looking at inflation of 10 percent, and it's largely due to commodities prices. But all over the world, you're seeing these effects. And so-and we're seeing them here: gas prices at all-time highs, and things like that. That's not something we can do something about. So that is really-and, by the way, headline inflation, headline inflation is important for expectations. People-the public's expectations, why would they be distinguishing between core inflation and headline inflation? Core inflation is something we [on the Committee] think about because it is a better predictor of future inflation. But headline inflation is what people experience. They don't know what core is. Why would they? They have no reason to. So that's-expectations are very much at risk due to high headline inflation. So it's become-the environment has become more difficult, clearly, in the last four or five months, and hence the need for the policy actions that we took today. Hence our resolution to get rates up and, ultimately, get them to where we think they need to be in coming months. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. I wanted to ask you-you talked about CPI going to 8.6 percent, that retail sales surprised the market by falling and then revisions to the previous months were down. Are you hearing from contacts about consumers slowing spending or changing their habits? CHAIR POWELL. So we're, of course, watching very, very carefully for that and looking at the retail-the big store numbers and all that kind of thing. And so I-but I think the fair summary of what we see is, you see continuing shifts in consumption, you see some things getting-sales going down, but overall spending is very strong. The consumer's in really good shape financially. They're spending. There's no sign of a broader slowdown that I can see in the economy. People are talking about it a lot-consumer confidence is very low. That's probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people. But that's what we're seeing. We're not seeing a broad slowdown. We see job growth slowing, but it's still at quite robust levels. We see the economy slowing a bit but still growth levels-healthy growth levels. EDWARD LAWRENCE. So then as you are raising rates in this economy, how closely are you watching consumer spending, or is there something-another indicator that you're watching more closely? CHAIR POWELL. It would be hard to watch anything much more closely than we watch consumer spending, but we watch everything. We watch business fixed investment, which actually has softened a bit. And we watch-we're responsible for watching everything. Consumption is 60-some percent of the economy, two-thirds of the economy, so, naturally, we spend a lot of time on that. And, again, there's a lot going on-there are a lot of flows back and forth-but, ultimately, it does appear that the U.S. economy is in a strong position and well positioned to deal with higher interest rates. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Are you targeting headline inflation now or core inflation? In other words, how far would you chase oil prices if they keep going up? If that's going to be the component that drives expectations, would you risk recession for a headline rate if the core rate is holding steady or starting to go down? CHAIR POWELL. So the-we're responsible for inflation in the law. And inflation means headline inflation. So that's our ultimate goal. We, of course, like all central banks do, look very, very carefully at core inflation because it is-it's a much better predictor, and it's much-it's a much better predictor of where inflation is going, and it's also more relevant to our tools. As I mentioned, the parts that don't go into core are mostly outside the scope of our tools, so we look at that. But it's-the current situation is particularly difficult because of what I mentioned about expectations. We can't affect, really-I mean, the energy prices are set by global commodity prices. And most of food-not all of it, but most food prices are pretty heavily influenced by global commodity prices, too. Also other things. So we can't really have much of an effect. But we have to be mindful of the potential effect on inflation expectations [coming] from headline [inflation readings]. So it's a very difficult situation to be in, and we-again, we can't do much about the difference between [headline and core inflation rates due to] the elements that make up headline that are not in core. MICHAEL MCKEE. Could I just, as a follow-up, get a clarification on the SEP? When the members gave their forecasts, when were they inserted into the record? Were they revised after the CPI or Michigan numbers came out? In other words, does the SEP, as we have it now, reflect the same factors that led you to go to a 75 basis point move? CHAIR POWELL. The SEP is of one piece. It reflects all of the economic readings. It also reflects the 75 basis point increase. This is important. So people had that in hand when they-when their SEPs were submitted. So it's-in other words, it's not in addition to what's in the SEP. The SEP-everyone's SEP reflects their thinking about this rate increase and what's going forward. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida from Politico. I wanted to ask about how you're measuring progress, especially since you've now started front-loading rate hikes more. You've talked about how you want to see inflation coming down over a series of reports, and I guess I'm curious whether you think inflation data itself is a really good indicator or whether you might be concerned that it's a lagging indicator or that it might send confusing signals given that, as you've talked about, there are sort of supply and demand aspects. And I guess my question is, do you think that inflation will tell you-inflation data will tell you when you've gone to where you need to go, or do you just feel like maybe it's better to overshoot than to undershoot? CHAIR POWELL. So I think the role that we can play-maybe the way to get at this is to say that the role that we can play is around demand, right? And we'll be able to see-the areas that we can affect are those associated with excess demand, and we'll be able to see our effect on, for example, job openings in real time. And that would tell us what's-that would tell us about wages. Wages are not principally responsible for the inflation that we're seeing, but, going forward, they would be very important, particularly in the service sector. Sorry, I'm not sure I'm getting to your question. VICTORIA GUIDA. My question is, is inflation data itself the best indicator for when you're getting to where you need to go, or might it lead you to go too far? CHAIR POWELL. There's always a risk of going too far or going not far enough, and it's going to be a very difficult judgment to make, or maybe not-maybe it'll be really clear. But we're-and we're quite mindful of the dangers. But I will say, the worst mistake we could make would be to fail, which-it's not an option. We have to restore price stability. We really do, because everything-it's the bedrock of the economy. If you don't have price stability, the economy's really not going to work the way it's supposed to. It won't work for people-their wages will be eaten up. So we want to get the job done. This inflation happened relatively recently. We don't think that it's affecting expectations in any kind of fundamental way. We don't think that we're seeing a wage-price spiral. We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent, and that's critical. It's absolutely key to the whole thing that we sustain that confidence. So that's how we're thinking about it. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I just want to expand, I guess, on what you just said now about the general public feeling like you can get this done. You talk about consumer sentiment being down, also inflation expectations being up, recession just broadly being dinner table talk. Does the general feel among American households and also businesses square with your explanation of the economy, given that the description of inflation in the statement didn't change between May and June? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So, clearly, people don't like inflation-a lot. And many people are experiencing it, really, for the first time, because we haven't had anything like this kind of inflation in 40 years. And it's really something people don't like. And they're experiencing that, and that's showing up in their-in surveys and in all kinds of ways. And we understand that, and we understand the hardship that people are experiencing from high inflation, and we're determined to do what we can to get inflation back down. So that's really what we're saying. We're not-I'm not-clearly, it's an incredibly unpopular thing, and it's very painful for people. I guess what I'm saying is, the question, the really critical question from the perspective of doing our job is making sure that the public does have confidence that we have the tools and will use them and they do work to bring inflation back down over time. It will take some time, we think, to get inflation back down, but we will do that. MICHELLE SMITH. Chris. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. You have talked about inflation a few times and mentioned oil prices, China lockdowns. But aside from rises in commodity prices such as gas prices, we're also seeing stickier measures of inflation increasing, such as the Cleveland Fed's median and trimmed mean CPIs. I mean, how persistent do you see those underlying measures of inflation, and how do you expect to-where do you see those going in the near future? CHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, I think, in my opening statement, inflation has started-it started off in quite narrow, very directly pandemic-related areas, and it's spread now broadly across the economy and into the services sector as well. It was really in the goods sector at the beginning. And, particularly, you're seeing in travel now, if you've flown on a plane lately-planes are very full, and plane tickets are very expensive. Some of that will be pass-through of energy prices, but it's-so you're experiencing services inflation. Shelter inflation is high. So the question-and then you see the Cleveland measure going up, and many other measures are going up. So it's a time when we're not seeing progress and we want to see progress, and that's really another part of why we did what we did today and why the SEP looks like it does. We see it as appropriate to get the policy rate up to restrictive levels, which would be, in the thinking of the Committee, somewhere in the range of 3 to 3Â½ percent by year-end. And then after that, you see what the rest of the SEP says. So I hope that's responsive to your question. MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Do you still think a softish landing is possible, and how would you define that at this point considering the revised projections for unemployment, GDP, inflation? CHAIR POWELL. So I think what's in the SEP would certainly meet that test. If you see-you're looking at getting back down to almost a 2 percent inflation by 2024, and the unemployment rate is still as low as 4.1 percent. That would be-I would call that as meeting that test. Do I still think that we can do that? I do. I think there's-I think there's-I don't want to be the handicapper here. I just-that is our objective, and I do think it's possible. Like I said, though, I think that events of the last few months have raised the degree of difficulty, created great challenges. And, again, the answer to the question, can we still do it-there's a much bigger chance now that it'll depend on factors that we don't control, which is, fluctuations and spikes in commodity prices could wind up taking that option out of our hands. So we just don't know, but we're focused on-very, very focused on getting inflation back down to 2 percent, which we think is essential for the benefit of the public and also to put us on a path back to a sustainably strong labor market like the one we had before the pandemic. MICHELLE SMITH. Greg. GREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chair Powell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more-economists are worried that you're kind of hitting the economy with a sledgehammer and that now there's even more risk of a recession than a 50-50 path of rates. So could you talk a little bit more about that? And what evidence would get you to stop rate hikes and maybe even reverse them? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, as I mentioned, financial conditions have tightened over the last seven months, and that's a good thing, we think. But the federal funds rate, even after this increase, is at 1.6 percent. So it's hard to see how that is too high of a rate. And even if we did another-so we're going to get here by the end of the summer, somewhere in the 2s probably. Still, that's still a low rate. So that's not a rate that is calculated to bring a recession on. And we'll-by then, we'll have seen a whole lot more data. As I mentioned a couple times, the Committee's views are around a modestly restrictive stance, which will be in the 3 to 3Â½ percent range by the end of this year, but that's conditioned on that being the appropriate thing to do. If we see data going in a different direction, it'll be reflected in our policy, as you see today. We'll be watching-if things go in a direction we don't expect, then we're going to adapt. And I would say, this is a highly uncertain environment-extraordinarily uncertain environment. So, again, we'll be determined and resolved, but flexible. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Evan. EVAN RYSER. Evan Ryser, Market News International. Thank you, Chair Powell. I was wondering if the Fed has initiated a review of the conduct of monetary policy over the last two years or so, given the inflation, and will that be shared with the public? And then, secondly, given the illiquidity and the extraordinary volatility in financial markets, are you concerned that QT will make that worse? CHAIR POWELL. Sorry, what was your question on QT? EVAN RYSER. Just given the illiquidity and extraordinary volatility in financial markets, whether QT will make things worse. CHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we've been looking very carefully and hard at why inflation picked up so much more than expected last year and why it proved so persistent. We-it's hard to overstate the extent of interest we have in that question morning, noon, and night. But you have to understand the context. For-really, the context is this: For decades before the pandemic and the reopening, you had a world where inflation was dominated by disinflationary forces such as declining population or aging demographics, let's call it that, globalization enabled by technology, other factors, low productivity. So and that's how all the models work is, decades and decades of data-they look at that. It's a very flat Philips curve world, and the supply shocks tend to be transient, right? So we have now experienced an extraordinary series of shocks, if you think about it: the pandemic, the response, the reopening, inflation, followed by the war in Ukraine, followed by shutdowns in China-the war in Ukraine potentially having effects for years here. So we're aware that a different set of forces are driving the economy-we have been, obviously, for quite a while. But this is a different-these forces are different. Inflation is behaving differently, and, in our thinking, it really is a question of very strong demand. But you couldn't get this kind of inflation without a change on the supply side, which is there for anybody to see, which is these blockages and shortages and people dropping out of the labor force and things like that. So that's how we're looking at it. And we've done a lot of work internally on, and thinking about, what all that means. You don't-the thing is, you don't know whether those forces are-to what extent are they going to be sustained? In other words, will we go back to a world where it looks a little more like the old world, or are we really going to be in a world where major supply shocks go on and on? The history is, you see these waves of supply shocks, as you did in the '70s, and then they go away, and sort of there's a ""new normal,"" and things settle down. But, honestly, we don't know what that's going to be. In the meantime, we have to find price stability in this new world and maximum employment in this new world where, clearly, inflationary forces are-you're seeing them everywhere. Again, if you look around the world at where inflation levels are, it's absolutely extraordinary. It's not just here. In fact, we're sort of in the middle of the pack, although I think we have, of course, a different kind of inflation than other people have, partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered. So that's what we're doing. We've done a lot of introspection and work on that and-sorry, on QT, we've communicated really clearly to the markets about what we're going to do there. Markets seem to be okay with it. We're phasing in-Treasury [security] issuance is down quite a lot, quite a lot from where it's been, so I have no reason to think-markets are forward looking, and they see this coming. I have no reason to think it will lead to illiquidity and problems. It seems to be kind of understood and accepted at this point. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. For the last question, we'll go to Mark Hamrick. MARK HAMRICK. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. I wonder what your assessment is about the outlook for the housing market, given the years-long increase in home prices and now the sharp rise in mortgage rates. And all that, of course, given the heightened sensitivity around the housing market given the fact that it was a trigger for the great financial crisis over a decade ago. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So rates were very low-a good place to start is that rates were very, very low for quite a while because of the pandemic and the need to do everything we could to support the economy when unemployment was 14 percent and the true unemployment rate was well higher than that. And that was a-rates are low, and now they're coming back up to more normal, or above, levels. So, in the meantime, while rates were low and while demand was really high, obviously demand for housing changed from wanting to live in urban areas to some extent to living in single-family homes in the suburbs, famously. And so the demand was just suddenly much higher. And we saw prices moving up very, very strongly for the last couple of years. So that changes now, and rates have moved up-we're well aware that mortgage rates have moved up a lot-and you're seeing a changing housing market. We're watching it to see what will happen. How much will it really affect residential investment? Not really sure. How much will it affect housing prices? Not really sure. It's-I mean, obviously, we're watching that quite carefully. You would think over time-I mean, so there's a tremendous amount of supply in the housing market of unfinished homes, and as those come on line-whereas the supply of finished homes, inventory of finished homes that are for sale, is incredibly low, historically low. So it's still a very tight market. So prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up. So it's a complicated situation. We watch it very carefully. I would say if you're a homebuyer, somebody or a young person looking to buy a home, you need a bit of a reset. We need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and where inflation is down low again and mortgage rates are low again. So this will be a process whereby we-ideally, we do our work in a way that the housing market settles in a new place and housing availability and credit availability are at appropriate levels. So thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Let's start with Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. I'm wondering if you can walk us through your thinking around the decision not to go for a full percentage point increase. We saw a ramp-up after the May CPI report came in hotter than usual and then, obviously, the June figure did, too. Was there any discussion of a stronger hike at this meeting? Yes. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we did judge that a 75 basis point increase was the right magnitude in light of the data and in the context of the ongoing increases in the policy rate that we've been making. I'd say that we wouldn't hesitate to, to make an even larger move than we did today if the Committee were to conclude that that was-that that were appropriate. That was not the case at this meeting. There was very broad support for the move that we made. You mentioned the-the June meeting. We, we had said many times that we were prepared to move aggressively, more aggressively, if inflation continued to disappoint. And that's why we did move to a more aggressive pace at the June meeting, as we said we would do. At this meeting, we continued at that more aggressive pace, as inflation has continued to disappoint, in the form of the June CPI reading. MICHELLE SMITH. Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you so much for taking our questions. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. As the Committee considers the policy path forward, how will it weigh the expected decline in headline inflation, which might come as a result of the drop in commodity prices, against the fact that we are likely to see some persistence in core readings, in particular? And given that potential tension and signs of, you know, any kind of activity weakening here, how has the Committee's thinking changed on how far into restrictive territory rates might need to go? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I'd start by saying we've been saying we would move expeditiously to get to the range of neutral. And I think we've done that now. We're at-we're at 2.25 to 2.5 [percent], and that's right in the range of what we think is neutral. So the question is, how are we thinking about the path forward? So one thing that hasn't changed is that-won't change-is that our focus is continuing to-is going to continue to be on using our tools to bring demand back into better balance with supply in order to bring inflation back down. That'll continue to be our overarching focus. We also said that we expect ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate and that we'll make decisions meeting by meeting. So what are we going to be looking at? You know, we'll be looking at the incoming data, as I mentioned, and that'll start with economic activity. Are we seeing the slowdown that we-the slowdown in economic activity-that we think we need? And there's some evidence that we are at this time. Of course, we'll be looking at labor market conditions. And we'll be asking whether we see the alignment between supply and demand getting better, getting closer. Of course, we'll be looking closely at inflation. You mentioned headline and core. Our mandate is for headline, of course; it's not for core. But we look at core because core is, is actually a better indicator of headline and of all inflation going forward. So we'll be-we'll be looking at both. And we'll be looking at them for-at those both, really-for what they're saying about the outlook rather than just simply for, for what they say. But we'll be asking: Do we see inflationary pressures declining? Do we see actual readings of inflation coming down? So, in light of all that data, the question we'll be asking is whether the stance of policy we have is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent target. And it's also worth noting that these rate hikes have been large, and they've come-they've come quickly. And it's likely that their full effect has not been felt by the economy. So there's probably some additional tightening, significant additional tightening, in the pipeline. So where are we going with this? I think the best-I think the Committee broadly feels that we need to get policy to at least to a moderately restrictive level. And maybe the best data point for that would be what we wrote down in our SEP at the-at the June meeting. So I think the median [federal funds rate] for the end of this year, the median would've been between 3Â¼ and 3Â½ [percent]. And, then, people wrote down 50 basis points higher than that for 2023. So that's-even though that's now six weeks old, I guess, that's-that's the most recent reading. Of course, we'll update that reading at the-at the September meeting in eight weeks. So that's how we're thinking about it. As I mentioned, as it relates to September, I said that another unusually large increase could be appropriate, but that's not a decision we're making now. It's one that we'll make based on the data we see. And we're going to be making decisions meeting by meeting. We think it's-we think it's time to just go to a meeting-by-meeting basis and not provide, you know, the kind of clear guidance that we had provided on the way to neutral. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you've said that your policy works through influencing expectations and that policy needs to be at least moderately restrictive, which means you need financial conditions to stay tight. Futures market pricing currently implies you will raise rates this year along the lines of your June SEP but then lower them a few months later next year. Are these expectations consistent with the need to keep financial conditions tight in order to moderate purchasing power and bring inflation back to 2 percent? CHAIR POWELL. So I'm going to start by pointing out that it's very hard to say with any confidence in normal times-in normal times-what the economy's going to be doing in 6 or 12 months. And to try to predict what the appropriate monetary policy would respond-response would be-of course, we do that in the SEP, but, nonetheless, you've got to take any estimates of what rates will be next year with a grain of salt, because there's so much uncertainty. These are not normal times. There's significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than I think there ordinarily is, and, ordinarily, it's quite high. So, again, I would-the best data, the only data point I have for you really is the June SEP, which I think is just the most recent thing that the Committee's done. Since then, inflation has come in higher; economic activity has come in weaker than expected. But at the same time, I would say that's probably the best estimate of where the Committee's thinking is still, which is that we would get to a moderately restrictive level by the end of this year-by which I mean somewhere between 3 and 3Â½ percent-and that when the Committee sees further rate increases in 2023, as I mentioned, we'll update that, of course, at the September meeting. But that's really the best I can do on that. NICK TIMIRAOS. You said inflation had been a little bit hotter than anticipated. Has your view of the terminal rate changed since June? CHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn't say it was-I think we didn't expect a good reading, but this one-this one was even worse than expected, I would say. I don't talk about my own personal estimate of, of what the terminal rate would be. I do-I will write down that in-it's going to evolve. Obviously, it has evolved over the course-I think, for all participants, it has evolved over the course of the year as we learn how persistent inflation's going to be. And by the time of the September meeting, we will have seen two more CPI readings and two more labor market readings and a significant amount of readings about economic activity and perhaps geopolitical developments, who knows. It'll be-it'll be a lot. It's an eight-week intermeeting period, so I think we'll see quite a lot of data. And we'll make our decision at that meeting based on that data. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. You kind of alluded to this earlier, but I wonder in the event that you see several months of very weak headline inflation numbers because oil prices are coming down so much, but core inflation continues to be strong or even picks up, I wonder how you would think about that. CHAIR POWELL. So it's hard to deal with hypotheticals, but I just would say this. We, you know, we would look at both, and we would ask-we'd be asking ourselves, are we confident that inflation is on a path down to 2 percent? That's really the question. And we'll be making-you know, our policy stance will be set at a level, ultimately, at which we are confident that inflation is going to be moving down to 2 percent. So you would-it would depend on a lot of things. Of course, as I mentioned, core inflation is a better predictor of inflation going forward. Headline inflation tends to be volatile. So, in ordinary times, you, you look through volatile moves in commodities. The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work-to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations. The public doesn't distinguish between core and headline inflation in their thinking. So it's something we have to take into consideration in our policymaking even though our tools don't really work on, on some aspects of this, which are the supply-side issues. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. Earlier this week, the President said, ""We are not going to be in a recession."" So I have two questions off of that. Do you share the President's confidence in not being in a recession? And, second, how would or would not a recession change policy? Is it a bright line, sir, where, where contraction of the economy would be a turning point in policy? Or is there some amount of contraction of the economy the Committee would be willing to abide in its effort to reduce inflation? CHAIR POWELL. So, as I-as I mentioned, we think it's necessary to have growth slow down. And growth is going to be slowing down this year for a couple of reasons, one of which is that you're coming off of the very high growth of the reopening year of 2021. You're also seeing tighter monetary policy. And you should see some slowing. We actually think we need a period of growth below potential in order to create some slack so that-so that the supply side can catch up. We also think that there will be, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions. And those are things that we expect. And we think that they're probably necessary if we were to have-to get inflation-if we were to be able to get inflation back down on a path to 2 percent and ultimately get there. STEVE LIESMAN. The question was whether you see a recession coming and how that might or might not change policy. Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So we're going to be-again, we're going to be focused on getting inflation back down. And we-as I've said on other occasions, price stability is really the bedrock of the economy. And nothing works in the economy without price stability. We can't have a strong labor market without price stability for an extended period of time. We all want to get back to the kind of labor market we had before the pandemic, where differences between, you know, racial and gender differences and that kind of thing were at historic minimums, where participation was high, where inflation was low. We want to get back to that, but that's not happening. That's not going to happen without, without restoring price stability. So that's something we see as, as something that we simply must do. And we think that in the-we don't see it as a tradeoff with, with the employment mandate. We see it as a way to facilitate the sustained achievement of the employment mandate in the longer term. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Particularly in regard to expectations, it's been said the last few months that the risks of doing too little outweighed the lists-the risks of doing too much. Does that remain the bias? CHAIR POWELL. So we're trying to do just the right amount, right? We're not-we're not trying to have a recession. And we don't think we have to. We think that there's a path for us to be able to bring inflation down while sustaining a strong labor market, as I mentioned, along with-in all likelihood-some, some softening in labor market conditions. So that is-that's what we're trying to achieve, and we continue to think that there's a path to that. We know that the path has, has clearly narrowed, really based on events that are outside of our control. And it may narrow further. So, you know, I do think-as I said just now-that restoring price stability is just something that we have to do. There, there isn't an option to fail to do that because that is the thing that enables you to have a strong labor market over time. Without restoring price stability, you won't be able, over the medium and longer term, to actually have a strong-a sustained period of very strong labor market conditions. So, of course, we serve both sides of the dual mandate, but we actually see them as well aligned on this. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. But as a-as a follow-on to that, given the uncertainty and that sort of paradoxical flow of data you've been getting, if you're going to make a mistake, would you rather make the mistake on doing too much, raising too much, than raising too little? CHAIR POWELL. We're trying not to make a mistake. Let me put it this way: We do see that there are two-sided risks. There would be the risk of doing too much and, you know, imposing more of a downturn on the economy than, than was necessary, but the risk-the risk of doing too little and leaving the economy with this entrenched inflation, it only raises the cost. If you fail to deal with it in the near term, it only raises the cost of, of dealing with it later to the extent people start to see it as just part of their economic lives. They start to factor high inflation into their decisions-when that-on a sustained basis. When that starts to really happen, and we don't think that's happened yet, but when that starts to happen, it just gets that much harder. And the pain will be that much greater. So I really do think that it's important that we-that we address this now and get it done. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. To build a little bit on what Steve was asking, do you believe the United States is currently in a recession? Will the GDP reading tomorrow affect that judgment one way or the other? And has your assessment of the risk of recession changed any in recent weeks? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't-I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession. And the reason is, there are just too many areas of the economy that are-that are performing, you know, too well. And, of course, I would point to the labor market, in particular. As I mentioned, it's true that growth is slowing for reasons that we understand. Really, the growth was extraordinarily high last year, 5Â½ percent. We would have expected growth to slow. There's also more slowing going on now. But if you look at the labor market, you've got growth-I think, payroll jobs averaging 450,000 per month. That's a remarkably strong level for, for this state of, of affairs. The unemployment rate at near a 50-year low at 3.6 percent. All of the wage measures that we track are running very strong. So this is a very strong labor market, and it's just not consistent with-you know, 2.7 million people hired in the first half of the year. It doesn't make sense that the economy would be in recession with, with this kind of thing happening. So I don't think the U.S. economy's in recession right now. NEIL IRWIN. GDP? GDP tomorrow? CHAIR POWELL. Ah, haven't seen it, and, and we'll just have to see what it says. I don't-I mean, I would say, generally, the GDP numbers do have a tendency to be revised pretty significantly. It's just-it's just that it's very hard-it's very hard to cumulate [to an estimate of] U.S. GDP. It's a large economy. And a lot of-a lot of work and judgment goes into that. But you tend to take first GDP reports, I think, with a-with a grain of salt. But, of course, it's something we'll be looking at. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the new conflict-of-interest rules that you all rolled out. Some senators have written asking for those rules to have more teeth and to have sort of more transparency about Fed's financial-the Fed officials' financial activity. I was wondering if you could speak to that and whether you intend on, you know, toughening those rules in any way. CHAIR POWELL. So those are-those are the toughest rules in place, you know, at any comparable institution that I'm aware of. We think-you know, we've thought about this carefully, and we put them in place. And we're building the infrastructure so that-so that, you know, the enforcement will be tight, that, actually, you won't be able to make trades unless they're precleared. And the amount of trades you make, they'll have to be 45 days or more before any FOMC meeting. It's just-I think we've really, you know, created a very strong and robust set of rules that will, you know, support public trust in the institution. And, again, we're just now-the system is just now up and running. And I'm proud of what we did. MICHELLE SMITH. Catarina. CATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair Powell. Hi. Catarina Saraiva, Bloomberg News. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the 75 basis points versus 50 versus 25. Can you talk a little bit about what, what kind of goes into your thinking for, you know, making the decision on how much to raise rates and, you know, just talking about a very large amount that you alluded to? Could that possibly be 100 basis points? And then, kind of along those lines, is there any sort of weakness in the economy, outside of inflation measures, that would lead you to slow your hiking pace? CHAIR POWELL. So I'm going to-I'm going to take that as a question about the next meeting and thereafter. So, as I mentioned, we're going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation. And we're going to be thinking about our policy stance and where does it really need to be. And I also mentioned that, as this process-now that we're at neutral-as the process goes on, at some point, it will be appropriate to, to slow down. And we haven't made a decision when that point is, but intuitively that makes sense, right? We've been front-end-loading these very large rate increases, and now we're getting closer to where we need to be. So that's how we're thinking about it. And in terms of September, we're going-we're going to watch the data and the evolving outlook very carefully and factor in everything and make a decision in September about what to do. And I'm not really going to provide any specific guidance about what that might be. So, you know, but I mentioned that we might do another unusually large rate increase. But that's not a decision that we've made at all. So we are-you know, we're going to be guided by the data. And I think you can still think of the, the destination as broadly in line with the September-sorry, the June SEP, because it's only six weeks old. And sometimes, sometimes SEPs can get old really quick. I think in this one-this one I would say is probably, probably the best guide we have as to where the Committee thinks it needs to get at the end of the year and then into next year. So I would point you to that. MICHELLE SMITH. Chris. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. I wanted to ask about right now, there's a sort of growing gap between the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the PCE, PCE index, and the one that's followed by the public, the CPI, of course. How do you expect to handle this divergence if the PCE starts to come down enough for you to consider slowing rate hikes, even if the public is still seeing much higher CPI ratings? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So it's an interesting, interesting situation. Of course, we've, we've long used PCE because we think it's just better at capturing the inflation that people actually face in their lives. And I think that that view is pretty widely understood. That said, the public really reads about CPI. And the difference really is because the CPI has higher weights on things like food, gasoline, motor vehicles, and housing than the PCE index does. And so that accounts for a lot of the difference. However, over time, they tend to come together. You know, we-given the importance in the public eye of CPI, we are calling it out and noticing it and everything like that. But remember, we do target PCE. That is because we think it's a better measure. They will come together eventually. The typical gap was really about 25 basis points for a very long time. And if it went-if it got to 40 basis points, that would be very noticeable. And now it's-now it's much larger than that because of the things I mentioned. So we'll be watching both, but, again, the one that we think is the best measure always has been PCE, at least since I think we-some 20 plus years ago-moved to PCE. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. I'd like to weave a couple of things together, Mr. Chairman. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. You said that the destination pretty much remains the same in terms of your end-of-the-year target. But where are you in the journey? We've now seen the federal stimulus programs end. You mentioned consumer spending, business investment have slowed. Are they moving at a pace you would expect? Or is demand still greater than supply-too much greater than supply that you need to do significantly more? And I ask because there are lags in the impact of monetary policy, as you mentioned. And a lot of this might hit in 2023. The strong dollar effect may hit in 2023, when the economy might be weak. How, how do you know where you are and where you think you need to get to? CHAIR POWELL. Well, just talking about demand for a second: As I mentioned in my remarks, I think you pretty clearly do see a slowing now in demand in the second quarter-consumer spending, business fixed investment, housing, places like that. I think, you know, people widely looked at the first-quarter numbers and thought they didn't make sense and might have been misleading in terms of the overall direction of the economy-[that was] not, not true of the second quarter. But at the same time, you have this labor market. So there are plenty of experiences where GDP has been reported as weak and the labor market as strong. And the economy has gone right through that and been fine. So that-that's happened many times. And it used to happen-if you remember, in the first quarter of every year, for several years in a row, GDP was negative, and the labor market was moving on just fine. And it turned out to just be measurement error. It was called residual seasonality. We don't know the situation. The truth is, though, we, we think that demand is moderating. We do. How much is it moderating? We're not sure. We're going to have to watch the data carefully. There are-there is a great deal of money on people's balance sheets that they can spend. The unemployment rate is very low. The labor market's very hot. There are many, many job openings. Wages are high. So it's the kind of thing where you think that the-that the economy should actually be, be doing pretty well in the second half of the year. But we'll have to see. We don't know that because you do see a marked slowing in the second quarter that does-that is fairly broad. So we'll be watching that. We'll be watching that. Of course, as I mentioned, we do want to see demand running below potential for a sustained period to create slack and, and give inflation a chance to come down. MICHELLE SMITH. Nicole. NICOLE GOODKIND. Hi, thank you, Chairman. Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business. When does the Committee expect to see a meaningful slowdown in the labor market? And how much weakness will it accept with regard to slower job growth and higher unemployment before it pauses or begins to think about cutting rates? CHAIR POWELL. So I think you're already seeing-you've seen, in the labor market, what you've seen is a decline from very high levels of job creation last year and earlier this year to modestly slower job creation-still, still quite robust, as I mentioned. So you're seeing that. You're seeing some increase-some increase in initial claims from insurance, although that may actually have to do with seasonal adjustments. We're not sure that that's actually real. There's some evidence that wages-if you look at average hourly earnings, they appear to be moderating, not so yet from the other wage measures. And we'll be getting the employment compensation index measurement, I think, on Friday, I guess. And that's a very important one because it adjusts for compensation-composition. So I'd say you-and also, anecdotally, you hear much-the sort of level of concern on the part of businesses that they simply can't find workers is probably down a little bit from what it was, say, for example, late in the latter parts of last year. So there's a feeling that the labor market is moving back into balance. If you look at-if you look at job openings or quits, you see them moving sideways or perhaps a little bit down. But it's only the beginning of an adjustment. But I think most-also, if you look at-I mean, once you start citing these things, you can't stop. If you look at the household survey, you see much lower job creation, and the household survey can be quite volatile, but it has no jobs created in the last three months. So that might be a signal that job creation's actually a little bit slower than we're seeing in the-in the establishment survey. So executive summary [is]: I would say there's some evidence that labor demand may be slowing a bit-labor supply, not so much. We have been disappointed that labor force participation really hasn't moved up since January. That may be related to yet another big wave of COVID. And there's evidence that that's the case. But-So we're not seeing much in the way of labor supply. Nonetheless, I would say some, some progress on demand and supply getting back in alignment. NICOLE GOODKIND. And then how much weakness would you be willing to accept before you think about pausing rate cuts? CHAIR POWELL. So I think we're looking-we're going to be looking at, at inflation as well. You know, as I mentioned, we need to see inflation coming down. We need to be confident that inflation is going to get back down to mandate-consistent levels. That's not something we can avoid doing. That really needs to happen. And, but we do think, though, that the labor market can adjust because of the huge overhang of job openings, of excess demand, really. There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than-perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment-lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level-the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience. And that suggests that this time could be different. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. So you said that the path may be narrowed to avoiding a recession. So how, how close are we to a recession? And then how do forecasts of possible recession from banks and economists, how does that make a soft landing you've talked about more difficult? CHAIR POWELL. So as, as I mentioned, it doesn't seem that the U.S. economy is in recession right now. And I think you do see weakening, some slowdown-let's put it that way-in growth. And you see it across some of the categories that I mentioned. But there's also just the very strong data coming out of the labor market, still. So, overall, you would say that, in all probability, demand is still strong, and, and the economy is still on track to continue to grow this year. But the slowdown in the second quarter is notable. And we're-you know, we're going to be watching that carefully. Sorry, what was the- EDWARD LAWRENCE. Forecasts. You know, how do bank forecasts of possible recessions, economists, does that affect the soft landing? CHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, we've said since the beginning, I think, that, that having a soft landing is what we're aiming for. Of course, that has to be our goal. It is our goal. And we'll keep trying to achieve it. I think-I do think events-at the beginning, we said it was not going to be easy. It was going to be quite challenging to do that. It's unusual. It's an unusual event. It's not a typical event, given where we are. If there is a path to it, and we think there is, it is the one I mentioned, that the labor market actually is-has such a large amount of surplus demand that you could see-you could see that demand coming down in a way that didn't translate into a big increase in unemployment as you would expect in the ordinary course because, frankly, the imbalance is so much greater. And, but we don't know that. I mean, this is a-this is a case of first impression. So anyone who is really sure that it's impossible or really sure that it will happen is probably underestimating the level of uncertainty. And so I would certainly say it's an uncertain, uncertain thing. Nonetheless, it's our goal to achieve it, and we'll keep trying to do that. MICHELLE SMITH. Jean. JEAN YUNG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet reduction program. It's been working for a couple months now and in a different environment than the last time the Fed did it. What are you learning about how it's working and how markets are reacting? And is reaching the minimum level of reserves needed in the system still several years away at the current pace? CHAIR POWELL. So we think it's working fine. As you know, we, we tapered up into it. And, and in September, we'll go to full strength. And the markets seem to have accepted it. By all assessments, the markets should be able to absorb this. And we expect that'll be the case. So I would say the plan is broadly on track. It's a little bit slow to get going because some of these trades don't settle until-for a bit of time. But it'll be picking up steam. So I guess your second question was getting-the process of getting back down to the new equilibrium will take a while. And that time, it's hard to be precise, but, you know, the model would suggest that it could be between two, two and a half years, that kind of thing. And this is a much faster pace than the last time. Balance sheet's much, much bigger than it was. But we looked at this carefully, and we thought that this, this was the sensible pace. And we have no reason to think it's not. MICHELLE SMITH. Brian. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. Looking at financial conditions, it seems like the tightening has slowed as of late with the 10 year coming down, 30-year fixed mortgage rates also going a bit sideways, when we talk about a hot housing market still. Just wondering if you find financial conditions tight enough, especially as you continue to raise rates. CHAIR POWELL. So a big piece of that is inflation expectations-you know, breakevens coming down, which, you know, is a good thing. It's a good thing that markets do seem to have confidence in, in the Committee's commitment to getting inflation back down to 2 percent. So we like to see market-based, you know, readings of inflation expectations come down. You know, broader financial conditions have tightened, tightened a good bit. I mean, the way this works is we, we set our policy, and financial conditions react, and then financial conditions are what affects the economy. And we don't control that second step. We're just going to do what we think needs to be done. We're going to-we're going to get our policy rate to a level where we're confident that inflation will be moving back down to 2 percent. Confident. So that's how we're going to take it. And, of course, we'll be watching financial conditions to see that they are appropriately tight and that they're having the effect that we would hope they're having, which is to see demand moderate and inflationary pressures recede and, ultimately, inflation come down. MICHELLE SMITH. Greg. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I wonder if you can go back a little bit in time to before there was this outbreak of inflation, when the Committee put in place forward guidance on tapering asset purchases. I think it was December 2020. There's a recent speech by Fed Governor Waller talking about that and saying that maybe that was too tight, that kind of condition, and it put you a little bit behind-not his words but maybe, you know, were kind of late to react to some of that inflation. So could you talk about that decision, and have you looked at it in hindsight at all? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, yes, we said that we wouldn't lift off until we had basically achieved our dual-mandate goals. And the reason we did it in real time was that, the first look at the new framework that we'd rolled out, plenty of people were saying, ""It's not credible. You'll never get inflation to 2 percent."" Some of our critics now who say inflation's too tight-too high were the same ones who were saying, ""You'll never get to 2 percent."" Well, but anyway, that's what happened. So we, we thought we needed to really make a strong statement with that. It wasn't part of the framework. The December '20 guidance was not part of our overall new framework. It was just guidance that we put in place. So I would say two things. One, I don't think that that has materially changed the situation. But I have to admit, I don't think I would do that again. I don't think I would do that again. We-you know, ultimately, the situation evolved in a highly unexpected way for all of us. And, you know, maybe the learning is that leave a little more flexibility than that. But did it matter in the end? You know, we-if you look at-I really don't think it did. I'm not sure it would've mattered if we'd been raising rates three months earlier. Does anybody think that would've made a big difference? I mean, lots of central banks were raising rates three months earlier, and it didn't matter. I mean, this is a-this is a global phenomenon that's happening now-admittedly, different in the United States, but anyway. MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. GREG ROBB. Can I follow up? MICHELLE SMITH. Sorry about that, Greg. GREG ROBB. Just a lot of people talk about that time, and they talk about a taper tantrum. I know you haven't talked about it too much but that you were worried at the time about repeating that taper tantrum that you had experienced as a Governor. So was that part of that? Where did that fit into all those decisions? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I think we learned-there've been multiple taper tantrums, right? So there was the famous one in 2013. There's what happened at the December '18 meeting, where, you know, markets can ignore developments around the balance sheet for years on end and then suddenly react very sharply. So we just had developed a practice of moving predictably and doing it in steps and things like that. It was just like that's how we did it. And so we did it that way this time. We were-we were careful to, to take steps and communicate and all that kind of thing. Yes, we were trying to avoid a tantrum because they can be quite destructive. They can tighten financial conditions and knock the economy off kilter. And, you know, when it happens, you have to-really, in both '13 and '18, it really had consequences for the real economy, you know, two, three, four months later. So we were trying to avoid that. That was part of it. Again, I don't think that's-the real issue of 2020 and '21 was just trying to understand what was happening with the reopening economy. That, that was where the big uncertainty was. And, you know, our view was that these supply-side issues would get better: that people would go back to work, that labor force participation would come back, everyone would get vaccinated, schools would open, kids would be in school, and labor force participation would jump back up. That's what we were-that was very broadly thought to be the case: these supply-side issues would get solved reasonably quickly. And they just haven't. They still haven't. So that's really the learning, I think, is around how complicated these supply-side issues can be. We haven't seen this before in a long, long time. And so that's really, you know, what accounts for the pace at which we moved, and we did. When inflation changed direction, really, in October, we've moved quickly since then. I think people would agree. But before then, inflation was coming down month by month. And, you know, we kind of thought we had the story-probably had the story right. But then, I think in October, you started to see a range of data that said ""No. This is a much stronger economy and much higher inflation than we've been thinking."" And, again, we've pivoted, and here we are. GREG ROBB. Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, I just want to pin you down a little bit more on the issue of recession. So if we get a negative GDP number tomorrow for the second quarter, would the Fed consider the U.S. in a recession? And just remind us, what is your definition for the start of a recession? CHAIR POWELL. So the Fed doesn't make a-doesn't make a judgment on that. You know, we're focused on the dual mandate and using our tools to achieve maximum employment and price stability. We don't-we don't say ""There is now a recession"" and that kind of thing. So that wouldn't be something we'd do. We would look at the data tomorrow-and no doubt, we'll look at it very carefully-and draw whatever implications we can. As I mentioned, though, you know, if you think about what an inflation-sorry, what a recession really is, it's a broad-based decline across many industries that, you know, is sustained for more than a couple of months, and there are a bunch of specific tests in it. And it just doesn't-this just doesn't seem like that now. What we have right now doesn't seem like that. And the real reason is that the labor market is just sending such a signal of economic strength that it makes you really question the GDP data. But, again, that's not a decision that we-that we make. And we won't-we won't reach a conclusion one way or another on that. MICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you very much. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. You said that some softening in the labor market is needed. Within the Fed, there are staff economists who've argued that NAIRU, the noninflationary rate of unemployment, might be as high as 5 to 6 percent right now, which obviously is a lot higher than the current rate of 3.6. What's your assessment of NAIRU? Is that something that came up in discussion with the Committee? CHAIR POWELL. So I think, broadly, a lot of economists think that the-that the natural rate of unemployment will have moved up to some significant extent above where we think it was before. And the reason is there's-it's the usual matching issue, where matching has become less effective, and that kind of thing when you have the kind of turbulent downturn and the big switches in demand from services to goods and all that. So it could be higher. And my own instinct is that the natural rate of unemployment is higher. Of course, I would add that we don't know it. We can never know where these star variables are in real time with any confidence. But I would say it must have moved up materially. But the other side of that is, as all these jobs get created and people go back to work and unemployment is so low, I think you could, in principle, you could see it coming back down pretty significantly. And that would also, by the way, take pressure off of inflation because it's that gap-it's the gap between actual unemployment and the-and the natural rate that really is relevant for, you know, the negative slack we have in the economy with the overtight labor market. So if you were to-you wouldn't observe this. It's an unobservable, but you could actually be seeing inflationary pressures coming down if that does happen. And we don't-we don't control that. But that's something that, logically, if the pandemic and the disorder in the labor market caused the natural rate to move up, then as the labor market settles down, in principle, you should see it move back down. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeff. JEFF COX. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. Just a question about-hate to keep banging the drum about recession. But most of the polls that we're seeing now from the public, people believe that we're already in a recession or heading for one-economists, pretty much the same thing. They're being told by folks like you and the Administration that we're not in a recession, we're not heading for a recession-frankly, coming from the same people who told them inflation was transitory, telling them now that we're not heading for a recession. So what would you tell the public to reassure them now that you feel confident in your forecast going forward and the Fed is ready to respond to a-to a potential downturn in the economy? CHAIR POWELL. No, all I've really said is I don't think it's likely that the U.S. economy's in a recession now. And I've explained why that is the case. It's, it's because you do see a very strong labor market. And I think the public will see that as well. You know, going forward, what we've seen is a-is a slowing in spending, as I mentioned. We've seen the very beginnings of perhaps a slight lessening in the-in the tightness of the labor market, but it would only be the beginnings. So, and I mentioned that, that-I also said that our goal is to bring inflation down and have a so-called soft landing, by which I mean a landing that doesn't require a significant increase, a really significant increase in unemployment. We're trying to achieve that. I have said, on many occasions, that we understand that's going to be quite challenging and that it's got more challenging over recent months. MICHELLE SMITH. Kyle. KYLE CAMPBELL. Thanks, Chair Powell. Kyle Campbell with American Banker. The FOMC has historically tried to avoid the kind of rapid monetary policy tightening that has happened so far this year. How concerned are you that the rate hikes that we've seen thus far might increase risks to financial stability not just domestically, but globally? CHAIR POWELL. I mean, there are precedents for the FOMC moving very quickly-for example, in 1994, and in 1980, even more so. So we've been known to do that when it's the appropriate thing to do. And this year, it clearly is. I would say that, given how quickly we've moved, I'm gratified that while-that, basically, markets have been working. They've been orderly. There's been some volatility, but that's only to be expected. For a financial stability perspective, you know, asset values are down, which in some-in some sense lowers vulnerabilities. It's when they're really high that you would worry that they're-that they're vulnerable to a fall, actually. Many asset values have come down. I think you've got a well-capitalized banking system. I think you have-households are generally in about as strong as financial shape as they've been in a very long time or perhaps ever given the money that's on people's balance sheets. So you have a pretty-from a financial stability standpoint, you have a pretty decent picture. Now, the macroeconomic, there are plenty of macroeconomic issues that don't rise to the level of financial stability concerns. By financial stability, you know, we think of that as things that might undermine the working of the financial system, so big, serious things. That's not to say that people at the lower end of the income spectrum aren't, aren't suffering, because they are. They're suffering from high inflation. They're going to the-to the grocery store and finding that, in many cases, their paycheck doesn't cover the food they're accustomed to buying. We're seeing actual, you know, real declines in food consumption. And, you know, it's very concerning. It's very unfortunate. And that's why we're-we're really committed to bringing down inflation-one of the reasons. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Mark for the last question. MARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. I can remember when you held your first news conference, and you vowed to be a very plainspoken Chairman, and we're thinking today about the impacts of Fed policy on individuals as well. What would you say to individuals or households who may yet lose their jobs in this tightening cycle in the fight against inflation as they try to translate what Fed policy means to them in this complicated economic landscape? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I guess the first thing I would say to, to every household is that we know that inflation is too high. We understand how painful it is, particularly for people who are living paycheck to paycheck and spend most of that paycheck on necessities, such as food and gas and heating their homes and clothing and things like that. We do understand that, that those people suffer the most. Middle-class and better-off people have some resources, where they can absorb these things. But people, many people, don't have those resources. So, you know, we-it is our job. It is our institutional role. We are assigned uniquely and unconditionally the obligation of, of providing price stability to the American people. And we're going to use our tools to do that. As I mentioned, there will be some, in all likelihood, some softening in labor market conditions. We need growth to slow to below potential growth. We don't want to-we don't want this to be bigger than it needs to be. But, ultimately, if you think about the medium and longer term, price stability is the thing that, that makes the whole economy work. It's what can-it can give us a strong labor market and wages that aren't being eaten up by high inflation. If you talk to people-again, people who are making, you know, wages, relatively low wages-they're the ones who are suffering the most from inflation. So it's all the more reason why we need to move, move on this. Thank you very much."

"JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. I wonder if you could give us a little detail around how you'll know when to slow down these rate increases and how you'll eventually know when to stop. CHAIR POWELL. So I will answer-I will answer your question directly, but I want to start here today by saying that my main message has not changed at all since Jackson Hole. The FOMC is strongly resolved to bring inflation down to 2 percent, and we will keep at it until the job is done. So the way we're thinking about this is, the overarching focus of the Committee is getting inflation back down to 2 percent. To accomplish that, we think we'll need to do two things, in particular: to achieve a period of growth below trend; and also some softening in labor market conditions to foster a better balance between demand and supply in the labor market. So on the first, the Committee's forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year. On the second, though, so far there's only modest evidence that the labor market is cooling off. Job openings are down a bit, as you know; quits are off their all-time highs; there's some signs that some wage measures may be flattening out but not moving up; payroll gains have moderated but not much. And in light of the high inflation we're seeing, we think we'll need to-and in light of what I just said, we think that we'll need to bring our funds rate to a restrictive level and to keep it there for some time. So, what will we be looking at, I guess, is your question. So we'll be looking at a few things. First, we'll want to see growth continuing to run below trend, we'll want to see movements in the labor market showing a return to a better balance between supply and demand, and, ultimately, we'll want to see clear evidence that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent. So that's what we'll be looking for. In terms of reducing rates, I think we'd want to be very confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent before we would consider that. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Can you talk about how you factor in the variable lags on inflation and the extent to which the outlook for rates should be seen as linear in the sense that you keep raising rates? Well, can you envision a time when there's a pause to kind of look at what has been wrought in the economy from the rate increases? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, of course, monetary policy does, famously, work with long and variable lags. The way I think of it is, our policy decisions affect financial conditions immediately. In fact, financial conditions have usually been affected well before we actually announce our decisions. Then, changes in financial conditions begin to affect economic activity fairly quickly, within a few months. But it's likely to take some time to see the full effects of changing financial conditions on inflation. So we are very much mindful for that. And that's why I noted in my opening remarks that, at some point, as the stance of policy tightens further, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of rate hikes while we assess how our cumulative policy adjustments are affecting the economy and inflation. So that's how we think about that. Your second question-sorry-was? STEVE LIESMAN. Is there a point in time you could see pausing? Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates, or is there-oh, sorry, I should know better than to not talk with a microphone. CHAIR POWELL. I should know better than to answer your second question. [Laughter] STEVE LIESMAN. Well, there you go. Is it linear? Do you keep raising rates, or is there a pause that you could envision where you kind of figure out what has happened to the economy and give time to catch up in the real economy-the rate increase time to catch up in the real economy? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I think it's very hard to say with precise certainty the way this is going to unfold. As I mentioned, what we think we need to do and should do is to move our policy rate to a restrictive level that's restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2 percent, where we have confidence of that. And what you see in the SEP numbers is people's views as of today, as of this meeting, as to the kind of levels that will be appropriate. Now, those will evolve over time, and I think we'll just have to see how that goes. There is a possibility, certainly, that we would go to a certain level that we're confident in and stay there for a time. But we're not at that level. Clearly, today we're, we've just moved, I think, probably, into the very lowest level of what might be restrictive, and, certainly, in my view and the view of the Committee, there's a ways to go. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank you for taking our questions. The projections show the unemployment rate rising to 4.4 percent next year, and, historically, that kind of rise in the unemployment rate would typically bring a recession with it. Should we interpret that to mean no soft landing, and is that kind of rise necessary to get inflation down? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So you're right-in the SEP, there's what I would characterize as a relatively modest increase in the unemployment rate from a historical perspective, given the expected decline in inflation. Now, why is that? So, really, that is what we generally expect because we see the current situation as outside of historical experience in a number of ways, and I'll mention a couple of those. First-and you know these-but first, job openings are incredibly high relative to the number of people looking for work. It's plausible, I'll say, that job openings could come down significantly-and they need to-without as much of an increase in unemployment as has happened in earlier historical episodes. So that's one thing. In addition, in this cycle, longer-run inflation expectations have generally been fairly well anchored, and, as I've said, there's no basis for complacency there. But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability. And I guess the third thing I would point to that's different this time is that part of this inflation is caused by this series of supply shocks that we've had, beginning with the pandemic, and, really, with the reopening of the economy, and more recently amplified and added to by Russia's invasion of Ukraine-have all contributed to the sharp increase in inflation. So these are the kinds of events that are not really seen in prior business cycles, and, in principle, if those things start to get better-and we do see some evidence of the beginnings of that. It's not much more than that, but it's good to see that. For example, commodity prices look like they may have peaked for now; supply chain disruptions are beginning to resolve. Those developments, if sustained, could help ease the pressures on inflation. So let me just say, how much these factors will turn out to really matter in this sequence of events-it remains to be seen. We have always understood that restoring price stability while achieving a relatively modest decline-or, rather, increase-in unemployment and a soft landing would be very challenging. And we don't know-no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or, if so, how significant that recession would be. That's going to depend on how quickly wage and price inflation pressures come down, whether expectations remain anchored, and whether, also, do we get more labor supply, which would help as well. In addition, the chances of a soft landing are likely to diminish to the extent that policy needs to be more restrictive or restrictive for longer. Nonetheless, we're committed to getting inflation back down to 2 percent-because we think that a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain later on. RACHEL SIEGEL. Just to follow up on one small thing-are vacancies still at the top of your list in terms of understanding the labor market and how much room there is there? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, vacancies are still almost a 2-to-1 ratio to unemployed people. That and quits are really very good ways to look at how tight the labor market is and how different it is from other cycles, where, generally, the unemployment rate itself is the single best indicator. We think those things have, for quite a time now, really added value in terms of understanding where the labor market is. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. You said not too long ago, in describing the policy destination, there's still a way to go. But I imagine you have to have some idea about how you're thinking about your destination, whether it's a stopping point or a pausing point. And so I was wondering if you could discuss how you are thinking about, as the data come in, where that destination is, how it's moving up. If inflation doesn't perform as you expect, do you want to have a policy rate that's above the underlying inflation rate, for example, and do you have an estimate for where you think the underlying inflation rate might be in the economy right now? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so, again, we believe that we need to raise our policy stance overall to a level that is restrictive-and by that I mean, is meaningfully, putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation. That's what we need to see in the stance of policy. We also know that there are long and variable lags, particularly as they relate to inflation. So it's a challenging assessment. So, what do you look at? You look at broader financial conditions, as you know; you look at where rates are, real and nominal in some cases; you look at credit spreads; you look at financial conditions indexes. We also, I would think-and you see this in the-this is something we talked about today in the meeting and talk about in all of our meetings. And you see this, I think, in the Committee forecast. You want to be at a place where real rates are positive across the entire yield curve. And I think that would be the case if you look at the numbers that we're writing down and think about-you measure those against some sort of forward-looking assessment of inflation, inflation expectations. I think you would see at that time-you'd see positive real rates across the yield curve, and that is also an important consideration. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for the opportunity. I just want to be clear on the SEPs. You say it's meeting by meeting, but it sure looks like we're going 75-50-25. Is 75 next month the baseline? CHAIR POWELL. So we make one decision per meeting, and the decision we made today was to raise the federal funds rate by 75 [basis points]. You're right that the median for the year-end suggests another 125 basis points in rate increases, but there's also, there's another fairly large group that saw a 100 basis points addition to where we are today. So that would be 25 basis points less. So we're going to make that decision at the meeting. We didn't make that decision today; we didn't vote on that. I would say that we're committed to getting to a restrictive level for the federal funds rate and getting there pretty quickly, and that's what we're thinking about. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, just as a follow-up to that, I'm wondering about the sort of risk-management considerations here, given there's some discussion now of overdoing it. What's the incentive to continue front-loading right now? Is it lack of progress on inflation seen in the CPI reports? Or is it a motivation to get as much done while the job market is still as strong as it is? CHAIR POWELL. So, what we've seen is, inflation has-our expectation has been that we would begin to see inflation come down, largely because of supply-side healing. By now we would have thought that we'd have seen some of that. We haven't. We have seen some supply-side healing, but inflation has not really come down. If you look at core PCE inflation, which is a good measure of where inflation is running now, if you look at it on a 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing annualized basis, you'll see that inflation is at 4.8 percent, 4.5 percent, and 4.8 percent. So that's a pretty good summary of where we are with inflation. And that's not where we expected or wanted to be. So, what that tells us is that we need to continue, and we can-keep doing these, and we did today-do another large increase as we approach the level that we think we need to get to. And we're still discovering what that level is. But people are writing that down in their SEP where they think policy needs to be. So that's how we're thinking about it. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Chair Powell, how should we interpret the fact that core inflation is still not forecast in the SEP to be back to target in 2025, and yet the dot plot projects cuts as early as 2024? And does that mean there's a level of inflation above the 2 percent target that the Fed is willing to tolerate? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess core is at 2.1 in 2025-in the median-and headline is at 2.0, so that's pretty close. I mean, we write down our forecasts, and we figure out what the median is, and we publish it. So it's not-I mean, I would say that if, actually, if the economy followed this path, this would be a pretty good outcome. But you're right-it is a tenth higher than 2 percent. COLBY SMITH. Okay. Just as a quick follow-up: I mean, if the concern is that underlying inflation is becoming more entrenched, perhaps, each month, then why forgo the more aggressive 100 basis point increase today, and does that risk having to do more later on? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we, as we said at the last press conference and in between that one and this one, we said that we would make our decision based on the overall data coming in. So, if you remember, we got a surprisingly low reading in July and then a surprisingly high reading for August. So I think you have to-you can't really-you never want to overreact too much to any one data point. So if you look at them together-and, as I just mentioned, if you really look at this year's inflation, 3-, 6-, and 12-month trailing, you see inflation is running too high. It's running 4.5 percent or above; you don't need to know much more than that. If that's the one thing you know, you know that this Committee is committed to getting to a meaningfully restrictive stance of policy and staying there until we feel confident that inflation is coming down. That's how we think about it. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the balance sheet. You all have left open the possibility that you might sell mortgage-backed securities, but we've seen significant slowing in the housing market. Mortgage rates have gone up significantly, and I'm just wondering whether conditions there might affect your plans for how quickly you have the runoff on the MBS side. CHAIR POWELL. So we, what we said, as you know, was that we would consider that once balance sheet runoff is well under way. I would say it's not something we're considering right now and not something I expect to be considering in the near term. It's just, it's something I think we will turn to, but that time, the time for turning to it, has not come and is not close. VICTORIA GUIDA. Will conditions in the housing market affect that decision? CHAIR POWELL. I think a number of things might affect that decision, really. The main thing is, we're not considering that decision, and I don't expect that we will any time soon. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Neil Irwin with Axios. A number of commentators have come to the view, including over at the World Bank, that simultaneous global tightening around the world is, creates a risk of a global recession that's worse than is necessary to bring inflation down. How do you see that risk? How do you think of coordination with your fellow central bankers? And is there much risk of overdoing it on a global level? CHAIR POWELL. So we, actually, my colleagues and I, a number of my FOMC colleagues and I, just got back from one of our frequent trips to Basel, Switzerland, to meet with other senior central bank officials from around the world. We are in pretty regular contact, and we exchange, of course-we all serve a domestic mandate, domestic objectives-in our case, the dual mandate, maximum employment and price stability. But we regularly discuss what we're seeing in terms of our own economy and international spillovers, and it's a very ongoing, constant kind of a process. So we are very aware of what's going on in other economies around the world and what that means for us, and vice versa. The forecasts that we put together, that our staff puts together, and that we put together on our own always take all of that-try to take all of that into account. I mean, I can't say that we do it perfectly, but it's not as if we don't think about the policy decisions-monetary policy and otherwise-the economic developments that are taking place in major economies that can have an effect on the U.S. economy. That is very much baked into our own forecast and our own understanding of the U.S. economy, as best we can. It won't be perfect. So I don't see-it's hard to talk about collaboration in a world where people have very different levels of interest rates. If you remember, there were coordinated cuts and raises and things like that at various times, but, really, we're all, we're in very different situations. But I will tell you, our contact is more or less ongoing, and it's not coordination, but there's a lot of information sharing. And we all, I think, are informed by what other important economies-economies that are important to the United States-are doing. MICHELLE SMITH. Craig. CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. Chair Powell, you talked about some ways the higher interest rates are affecting the economy, but we've also seen a resilient labor market with durable consumption, strong corporate profits, and I'm wondering what your story is on the resilience of the economy. After all, you and your colleagues said, ""Well, we started tightening in March when we were talking about interest rates in the future."" And, indeed, Treasury rates moved up, so we should have had a lot of tightening taking effect. Why is the economy, in your view, so resilient, and does it mean that we might need a possibly higher terminal rate? CHAIR POWELL. You're right, of course-the labor market, in particular, has been very strong. But there are-the sectors of the economy that are most interest rate sensitive are certainly showing the effects of our tightening, and, of course, the obvious example is housing, where you see declining activity of all different kinds and house price increases moving down. So we're having an effect on interest-sensitive spending. I think, through exchange rates, we're having an effect on exports and imports. I think-so all of that's happening, but you're right, and we've said this: This is a strong, robust economy. People have savings on their balance sheet from the period when they couldn't spend and where they were getting government transfers. There's still very significant savings out there, although not as much at the lower end of the income spectrum-but still, some savings out there to support growth. The states are very flush with cash, so there's good reason to think that this will continue to be a reasonably strong economy. Now, the data sort of are showing that growth is going to be below trend this year. We think of trend as being about 1.8 percent, or in that range. We're forecasting growth well below that, and most forecasters are. But you're right-there's certainly a possibility that growth can be stronger than that. And that's a good thing, because that means the economy will be more resistant to a significant downturn. But, of course, we are focused on the thing I started with, which is getting inflation back down to 2 percent. We can't fail to do that. I mean, if we were to fail to do that, that would be the thing that would be most painful for the people that we serve. So for now, that has to be our overarching focus, and you see that, I think, in the SEP, in the levels of rates that we'll be moving to reasonably quickly, assuming things turn out roughly in line with the SEP. So that's how we think about it. MICHELLE SMITH. Mike. Thank you. MICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In a world of euphemisms that we live in here, with ""below-trend growth"" and ""modest increase in unemployment,"" I'm wondering if I can ask you a couple of direct questions for the American people. Do the odds now favor, given where you are and where you're going with interest rates, favor a recession? Four point four percent unemployment is about 1.3 million jobs. Is that acceptable job loss? And then, given that the data you look at is backward looking, and the lags in your policy are forward looking, and you don't know what they are, how will you know, or will you know, if you've gone too far? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't know what the odds are. I think that there's a very high likelihood that we'll have a period of what I've mentioned is below-trend growth, by which I mean much lower growth, and we're seeing that now. So the median forecast, I think, this year among my colleagues and me was 0.2 percent growth. So that's very slow growth. And then below trend next year. I think the median was 1.2, also well below. So that's a slower, that's a very slow level of growth, and it could give rise to increases in unemployment. But I think that's, so that is something that we think we need to have, and we think we need to have softer labor market conditions as well. We're never going to say that there are too many people working, but the real point is this: Inflation-what we hear from people when we meet with them is that they really are suffering from inflation. And if we want to set ourselves up, really light the way to another period of a very strong labor market, we have got to get inflation behind us. I wish there were a painless way to do that. There isn't. So, what we need to do is get rates up to the point where we're putting meaningful downward pressure on inflation, and that's what we're doing. And we certainly don't hope, we certainly haven't given up the idea that we can have a relatively modest increase in unemployment. Nonetheless, we need to complete this task. MICHAEL MCKEE. But how will you know, or will you know, if you've gone too far? CHAIR POWELL. It's hard to hypothetically deal with that question. I mean, again, our really tight focus now continues to be ongoing rate increases to get the policy rate up where it needs to be. And, as I said, you can look at this SEP as today's estimate of where we think those rates would be. Of course, they will evolve over time. MICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber. CHRIS RUGABER. Thanks. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. I wanted to follow up with what you just mentioned about the labor market. You've said several times that to have the labor market we want, we need price stability, and you suggested maybe there isn't a tradeoff in the long run. But in the short run, there is a lot of concern, as people have been expressing here, about higher unemployment as a result of these rate hikes or as a result of rate hikes. So can you explain, though, what about high inflation now threatens the job market? I mean, you seem to suggest inflation, high inflation, will eventually lead to a weaker job market. So can you spell that out a little more for the general public on how that would work? CHAIR POWELL. So, for starters, people are seeing their wage increases eaten up by inflation. So if your family is one where you spend most of your paycheck, every paycheck cycle, on gas, food, transportation, clothing, basics of life, and prices go up the way they've been going up, you're in trouble right away. You don't have a cushion, and this is very painful for people at the lower end of the income and wealth spectrum. So that's what we're hearing from people is, you know, very much-that inflation is really hurting. So how do we get rid of inflation? And, as I mentioned, it would be nice if there were a way to just wish it away, but there isn't. We have to get supply and demand back into alignment, and the way we do that is by slowing the economy. Hopefully, we do that by slowing the economy, and we see some softening in labor market conditions, and we see a big contribution from supply-side improvements, and things like that. But none of that is guaranteed. In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think-you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time. We really saw that for a long time. The United States had 2 percent inflation, didn't move around much, and that was enormously beneficial to the public that we serve. And we have to get back to that and keep it for another long period of time. To pull back from the task of doing that is, you're just postponing-the record shows that if you postpone that, the delay is only likely to lead to more pain. So I think we're moving to do what we need to do and do our jobs, and that's what you see us doing. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you for taking the question, Mr. Chairman. Edward Lawrence for Fox Business. So you had said that Americans and businesses need to feel some economic pain as we go forward. How long from here should Americans be prepared for that economic pain? CHAIR POWELL. How long? I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down. And so what you see in our projections today is that inflation moves down significantly over the course of next year and then more the next year after that. And I think once you're on that path, that's a good thing. And things will start to feel better to people-they'll feel lower inflation, they'll feel that the economy is improving. And also, if our projections are close to right, you'll see that the costs in unemployment are, they're meaningful, and they're certainly very meaningful to the people who lose their jobs. And we talk about that in our meetings quite a lot. But, at the same time, we'd be setting the economy up for another long period-this era has been noted for very long expansions. We've had three of the four longest in measured history since we got inflation under control. And that's not an accident. So when inflation is low and stable, you can have these 9, 10, 11-10-year, anyway, expansions, and you can see what we saw in 2018, '19, and '20, which was very low unemployment, the biggest wage gains going to people at the low end of the spectrum, the smallest racial gaps that we've seen since we started keeping track of that. So we want to get back to that. But, to get there, we're going to have to get supply and demand back in alignment, and that's going to take tight monetary policy for a period of time. EDWARD LAWRENCE. As a follow-up, what is that economic pain in your mind? Is it job losses? Is it higher interest rates on credit cards? What is that economic pain? CHAIR POWELL. So it's all of those things. Higher interest rates, slower growth, and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve. But they're not as painful as failing to restore price stability and then having to come back and do it down the road again and doing it at a time when, actually, now people have really come to expect high inflation. If the concept of high inflation becomes entrenched in people's economic thinking about their decisions, then sort of getting back to price stability-the cost of getting back to price stability just rises, and so we want to avoid that. We want to act aggressively now and get this job done and keep at it until it's done. MICHELLE SMITH. Nicole, from CNN. NICOLE GOODKIND. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business. Existing home sales have fallen for seven months straight, mortgage rates are at their highest level since 2008, yet mortgage demand increased this week, and housing prices are still elevated. Now, at the end of your June press conference, you mentioned plans to reset the housing market. I was wondering if you could elaborate on what you mean when you say ""reset"" and what you think it will take to actually get there. CHAIR POWELL. So when I say ""reset,"" I'm not looking at a particular, specific set of data or anything. What I'm really saying is that we've had a time of a red-hot housing market all over the country, where, famously, houses were selling to the first buyer at 10 percent above the ask, before even seeing the house. That kind of thing. So there was a big imbalance between supply and demand. Housing prices were going up at an unsustainably fast level. So the deceleration in housing prices that we're seeing should help bring sort of prices more closely in line with rents and other housing market fundamentals, and that's a good thing. For the longer term, what we need is supply and demand to get better aligned so that housing prices go up at a reasonable level-at a reasonable pace-and that people can afford houses again. And I think we-so we probably, in the housing market, have to go through a correction to get back to that place. There's also, there are also longer-run issues, though, with the housing market. As you know, we're-it's difficult to find lots now close enough to cities and things like that, so builders are having a hard time getting zoning and lots and workers and materials and things like that. But from a sort of business cycle standpoint, this difficult correction should put the housing market back into better balance. NICOLE GOODKIND. Just to follow, though, shelter made up such a large part of this hot CPI report that we saw. Do you think that there is a lag and that we will see that come down in the coming months? Or do you think that there's still this imbalance that needs to be addressed? CHAIR POWELL. I think that shelter inflation is going to remain high for some time. We're looking for it to come down, but it's not exactly clear when that will happen. So it may take some time, so I think, hope for the best, plan for the worst. So I think, on shelter inflation, you've just got to assume that it's going to remain pretty high for a while. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, we'll go to Jean for the last question. JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Market News. You've talked about the need to get real rates into positive territory, and you said earlier that policy is just moving into that territory now. So I'm curious, how restrictive is rates at 4.6 percent expected-is that expected to be next year? How restrictive? CHAIR POWELL. So I think if you look, when we get to-if we-let's assume we do get to that level, which I think is likely. What you're going to do is, you're going to adjust that for some forward-looking measure of inflation. And that could be-you pick your measure. It could be-there are all kinds of different things you could pick and you get-but what you'll get is a positive number. In all cases, you will get forward inflation expectations in the short term, I think, that are going to be, assuming that we're doing our jobs appropriately, that will be significant. So you'll have a positive [real] federal funds rate at that point, which could be 1 percent or so, but-I mean, I don't know exactly what it would be. But it would be significantly positive when we get to that level. And let me say, we've written down what we think is a plausible path for the federal funds rate. The path that we actually execute will be enough. It will be enough to restore price stability. So this is something that, as you can see, they've moved up, and we're going to continue to watch incoming data and the evolving outlook and ask ourselves whether our policy is in the right place as we go. Thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. On the need to slow the pace of rate increases at some point: Is a downshift contingent on a string of better inflation data specifically between now and, let's say, the December meeting? Or is that something that the Fed could potentially proceed with, independent of that data, given the lagged effects that you mentioned? CHAIR POWELL. So a couple things on that. We do need to see inflation coming down decisively, and good evidence of that would be a series of down monthly readings. Of course, that's what we'd all love to see, but that's-I've never thought of that as the appropriate test for slowing the pace of increases or for identifying the appropriately restrictive level that we're aiming for. We need to bring our policy stance down to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. How will we know that we've reached that level? Well, we'll take into account the full range of analysis and data that bear on that question, guided by our assessment of how much financial conditions have tightened, the effects that that tightening is actually having on the real economy and on inflation, taking into consideration lags, as I mentioned. We will be looking at real rates, for example, all across the yield curve and all other financial conditions as we make that assessment. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I'm sure there's going to be tons of confusion out there about whether this means you're going to slow in December or not. Would you say that the bias right now is not for another 75 basis point increase? CHAIR POWELL. So, what I want to do is put that question of pace in the context of our broader tightening program, if I may, and talk about the statement language along the way. So I think you can think about our tightening program as really addressing three questions, the first of which was, and has been, how fast to go. The second is how high to raise our policy rate. And the third will be, eventually, how long to remain at a restrictive level. So on the first question-how fast to tighten policy-it's been very important that we move expeditiously, and we have clearly done so. We've moved 3 percent since March, admittedly from a base of zero. It's a historically fast pace, and that's certainly appropriate given the persistence and strength in inflation and the low level from which we started. So now we come to the second question, which is how high to raise our policy rate. And we're saying that we'd raise that rate to a level that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation to our 2 percent target over time, and we put that into our postmeeting statement because that really does become the important question, we think now, is how far to go. And I'll talk more about that. We think there's some ground to cover before we meet that test, and that's why we say that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate. And, as I mentioned, incoming data between the meetings, both a strong labor market report but particularly the CPI report, do suggest to me that we may ultimately move to higher levels than we thought at the time of the September meeting. That level is very uncertain, though, and I would say we're going to find it over time. Of course, with the lags between policy and economic activity, there's a lot of uncertainty, so we note that in determining the pace of future increases, we'll take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy as well as the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation. So I would say, as we come closer to that level, move more into restrictive territory, the question of speed becomes less important than the second and third questions. And that's why I've said at the last two press conferences that at some point, it will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases. So that time is coming, and it may come as soon as the next meeting or the one after that. No decision has been made. It is likely we'll have a discussion about this at the next meeting, a discussion. To be clear, let me say again [that] the question of when to moderate the pace of increases is now much less important than the question of how high to raise rates and how long to keep monetary policy restricted, which really will be our principal focus. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, to what degree was there an importance or weight given to a need to signal this possibility now, given all the concerns, really around the globe, about Fed policy sort of driving ahead and everybody else dealing with their own stress as a result? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think I'm pleased that we have moved as fast as we have. I don't think we've overtightened. I think there's-very difficult to make a case that our current level is too tight, given that inflation still runs well above the federal funds rate. So I think that at this meeting, as in the last two meetings, as I've mentioned, I've said that we-that there would come a point, and this was a meeting at which we had a discussion about what that might mean. And we did discuss this, and, as I mentioned, we'll discuss it again in December. But there's no-I don't have any sense that we've overtightened or moved too fast. I think it's been good and a successful program that we've gotten this far this fast. Remember, though, that we still think there's a need for ongoing rate increases, and we have some ground left to cover here, and cover it we will. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, core PCE inflation on a 3- or 6-month annualized basis and on a 12-month basis has been running in the high 4s, close to 5 percent. Is there any reason to think you won't have to raise rates at least above that level to be confident that you are imparting enough restraint to bring inflation down? CHAIR POWELL. So this is the question of, does the policy rate need to get above the inflation rate? And I would say, there are a range of views on it. That's the classic ""Taylor principle"" view. But I would think you'd look more at a forward, a forward-looking measure of inflation to look at that. But I think the answer is, we'll want to get the policy rate to a level where it is, where the real interest rate is positive. We will want to do that. I do not think of it as the single and only touchstone, though. I think you put some weight on that; you also put some weight on rates across the curve. Very few people borrow at the short end-at the federal funds rate, for example. So households and businesses, if they're [borrowing]-[there are] very meaningfully positive interest rates all across the curve for them, credit spreads are larger, so borrowing rates are significantly higher, and I think financial conditions have tightened quite a bit. So I would look at that as an important feature. I'd put some weight on it, but I wouldn't say it's something that is the single, dominant thing to look at. NICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up: What is your best assessment, or the staff's best assessment right now, of the current rate of underlying inflation? CHAIR POWELL. I don't have a specific number for you there. There are many, many models that look at that. And, I mean, one way to look at it is that it's a pretty stationary object and that when inflation runs-above that level, for sure-substantially above for some time, you'll see it move up, but the movement will be fairly gradual. So I think that's what the principal models would tend to say. But I wouldn't want to land on any one assessment. There are many different-as you know, many different people publish an assessment of underlying inflation. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. I wondered, do you see any evidence at this stage that inflation is, or is at risk of becoming, entrenched? CHAIR POWELL. Is inflation becoming entrenched? So I guess I would start by pointing to expectations. So if we saw longer-term expectations moving up, that would be very troubling. And they were moving up a little bit at the middle part of this year, and they've moved now back down. That's one piece of data. Shorter-term inflation expectations moved up between the last meeting and this meeting, and we don't think those are as indicative, but they may be important in the wage-setting process. There's a school of thought that believes that. So that's very concerning. I guess the other thing I would say is that the longer we have-we're now 18 months into this episode of high inflation, and we don't have a clearly identified, scientific way of understanding at what point inflation becomes entrenched. And so the thing we need to do from a risk-management standpoint is to use our tools forcefully but thoughtfully and get inflation under control-get it down to 2 percent-get it behind us. That's what we really need to do and what we're strongly committed to doing. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. The statement points to lag times. I'm wondering if you can walk us through how you judge those lag effects, what that timeline looks like over the coming months or even a year, and where you would expect it to show up in different parts of the economy. CHAIR POWELL. So the way I would think about that is, it's commonly, for a long time, thought that monetary policy works with ""long and variable lags,"" and that it works first on financial conditions and then on economic activity and then perhaps later than that even on inflation. So that's been the thinking for a long time. There was an old literature that made those lags out to be fairly long. There's newer literature that says that they're shorter. The truth is, we don't have a lot of data [consisting] of inflation of [rates] this high in what is, now, the modern economy. One big difference now is that it used to be that you would raise the federal funds rate, financial conditions would react, and then that would affect economic activity and inflation. Now financial conditions react well before in expectation of monetary policy [actions]. That's the way it has moved for a quarter of a century-in the direction of financial conditions, then monetary policy-because the markets are thinking, what is the central bank going to do? And there are plenty of economists that also think that once financial conditions change, that the effects on the economy are actually faster than they would have been before. We don't know that. I guess the thing that I would say is: It's highly uncertain-highly uncertain. And so from a risk-management standpoint-but we do need, it would be irresponsible not to, to ignore them. But you want to consider them but not take them literally. So I think it's a very difficult place to be, but I would tend to be-want to be in the middle looking carefully at what's actually happening with the economy and trying to make good decisions from a risk-management standpoint, remembering, of course, that if we were to overtighten, we could then use our tools strongly to support the economy, whereas if we don't get inflation under control because we don't tighten enough, now we're in a situation where inflation will become entrenched and the costs, the employment costs in particular, will be much higher potentially. So from a risk-management standpoint, we want to be sure that we don't make the mistake of either failing to tighten enough or loosening policy too soon. RACHEL SIEGEL. And if I could follow up: Should we interpret the addition to the statement to mean that more weight is put into those lag effects than they would have been after previous rate hikes? CHAIR POWELL. I think as we move now into restrictive territory, as we make these ongoing rate hikes and policy becomes more restrictive, it'll be appropriate now to be thinking more about lags. Of course, we think about lags-the lags are just sort of a basic part of monetary policy. But we will be thinking about them, but we won't be-I think we'll be considering them but because it's appropriate to do so. Let me say this: It is very premature to be thinking about pausing. So people, when they hear lags, they think about a pause. It's very premature, in my view, to think about or be talking about pausing our rate hike. We have a ways to go. Our policy-we need ongoing rate hikes to get to that level of sufficiently restrictive. And we don't-of course, we don't really know exactly where that is. We have a sense, and we'll write down in September-sorry, in the December meeting, a new Summary of Economic Projections, which updates that. But I would expect us to continue to update it based on what we're seeing with incoming data. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil Irwin. NEIL IRWIN. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin, Axios. As you look around the economy, the clearest impact of your tightening so far has been on housing, maybe some venture-funded tech companies. It's been relatively narrow in terms of the labor market, consumer demand; a lot of sectors, you don't see a ton of effect. Is the pathway and channels through which monetary policy works changing? Is it narrower than it used to be? And on housing in particular, are you at all worried that you're cramping housing supply in ways that might cause problems down the road? CHAIR POWELL. I don't know that the channels through which policy works have changed that much. I would say a big channel is the labor market, and the labor market is very, very strong. Very strong. And households, of course, have strong balance sheets. So we go into this with a strong labor market and excess demand in the labor market, as you can see through many different things, and also with households who have strong spending power built up. So it may take time, it may take resolve, it may take patience. It's likely to, to get inflation down. It may-I think you see, from our forecasts and others, that it will take some time for inflation to come down. It'll take time, we think. So, sorry, was I getting to your question there? NEIL IRWIN. Housing. CHAIR POWELL. Oh, housing-the housing part of it. Yes, so we look at housing-of course, housing is significantly affected by these higher rates, which are really back where they were before the Global Financial Crisis-they're not historically high, but they're much higher than they've been. And you're seeing housing activity decline, and you're seeing housing prices growing at a faster rate and, in some parts of the country, declining. You know, I would say housing was-the housing market was very overheated for the couple of years after the pandemic as demand increased and rates were low. We all know the stories of how overheated the housing market was, prices going up. Many, many bidders and no conditions, that kind of thing. So the housing market needs to get back into a balance between supply and demand. We're well aware of what's going on there. From a financial stability standpoint, we didn't see in this cycle the kinds of poor credit underwriting that we saw before the Global Financial Crisis. Housing credit was very carefully-much more carefully managed by the lenders. So it's a very different situation and doesn't present potential financial-doesn't appear to present financial stability issues. But, no, we do understand that that's really where a very big effect of our policy is. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the labor market. You mentioned early on, again, that job openings are very high compared to available workers, and I'm just curious to what extent you do and don't draw signal from that. So, for example, if wage growth is slowing and if maybe the unemployment rate starts to tick up, will that make you sort of decrease your focus on job openings? What do you see-are wages what's really important? How are you thinking about the labor market as it relates to inflation? CHAIR POWELL. So we talk a lot about vacancies in the-vacancy-to-unemployed rate, but it's just one, it's just another data series. It's been unusually important in this cycle because it's been so out of line. But so has quits. So have wages. So we look at a very wide range of data on the unemployment-on the labor market. So I'd start with unemployment, which is typically the single statistic you would look to, is at a 50-year low, 3Â½ percent. We're getting really nothing in labor supply now. We had, I think, very small increase this year, which we had really thought, we thought we would get that back. Most analysts thought we would get some labor supply coming in. You mentioned wages, so I guess I would characterize that as sort of a mixed picture. It's true, with average hourly earnings, you see-so I would call it a flattening out at a level that's well above the level that would be consistent over time with 2 percent inflation, assuming a reasonable productivity. With the ECI reading this week, again, a mixed picture. The headline number was a disappointment. Let's just say it was high. It didn't show a decline. There's some rays of light inside that if you look at private-sector workers-that did come down, that compensation did come down. Overall, though, the broader picture is of an overheated labor market where demand substantially exceeds supply. Job creation still exceeds sort of the level that would hold the market where it is. So that's the picture. Do we see-we keep looking for signs that sort of the beginning of a gradual softening is happening. And maybe that's there, but it's not obvious to me, because wages aren't coming down-they're just moving sideways at an elevated level, both ECI and average hourly earnings. We want to see-we would love to see vacancies coming down, quits coming down. They are coming down. Vacancies are below their all-time high but not by as much as we thought, because-and the data series is volatile, we never take any one reading, we always look at two or three. So it's a mixed picture. I don't see the case for real softening just yet. But we look at, I guess as I just showed you, we look at a very broad range of data on the labor market. VICTORIA GUIDA. So do you see wages as being a significant driver of inflation? CHAIR POWELL. I think wages have an effect on inflation and inflation has an effect on wages. I think that's always been the case. There's always-going back and forth, the question is, is that really elevated right now? I don't think so. I don't think wages are the principal story of why prices are going up. I don't think that. I also don't think that we see a wage-price spiral, but, again, it's not something you can-once you see it, you're in trouble. So we don't want to see it. We want wages to go up-we just want them to go up at a level that's sustainable and consistent with 2 percent inflation. And we think we can-we do think that, given the data that we have, that this labor market can soften without having to soften as much as history would indicate through the unemployment channel. It can soften through job openings declining. We think there's room for that. But we won't know that-that'll be, that'll be discovered empirically. KAYLA TAUSCHE. Thank you so much. Kayla Tausche from CNBC. Earlier last month, the United Nations warned that there could be a global recession if central banks didn't change course. The new U.K. prime minister warned of a profound economic crisis there. And I'm wondering how the Fed is weighing international developments in light of a very strong economy here in the U.S. that would seem to be bucking those trends. CHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we, we keep close tabs on economic developments and also geopolitical developments that are relevant to the economy abroad. We're in very frequent contact with our foreign counterparts both through the IMF meetings and the regular meetings with central banks that we have, and I have one this weekend with many, many central bankers. So we're in touch with all of that. So I guess what-it's clearly a time, a difficult time in the global economy. We're seeing very high inflation in Europe, significantly because of high energy prices related to the war in Ukraine. And we're seeing China's having issues with the zero-COVID policy and much slower growth than we're used to seeing. So we're seeing-we see those difficulties. The strong dollar is a challenge for some countries. But we haven't-we take all of that into account in our models. We think about the spillovers and that sort of thing. Here in the United States, we have a strong economy, and we have an economy where inflation is running at 5 percent. Core PCE inflation-which is a really good indicator of what's going on for us, the way we see it-is running at 5.1 percent on a 12-month basis and sort of similar to that on a 3-, 6-, and 9-month basis. So we know that we need to use our tools to get inflation under control. The world's not going to be better off if we fail to do that. That's a task we need to do. Price stability in the United States is a good thing for the global economy over a long period of time. Price stability is the kind of thing that pays dividends for our economy-for decades, hopefully-even though it may be difficult to get it back. Getting it back is something that gives-that provides value to the people we serve for the long run. KAYLA TAUSCHE. If I could just follow up up on that-thank you. The Fed has acknowledged in the past that the tools that you have don't affect things like energy and food prices that stem from some of those conflicts overseas, and they're some of the biggest pain points for consumers. So as you pursue the current path that you've outlined, is there a risk that some of those prices simply don't come down? CHAIR POWELL. So we don't directly affect, for the most part, food and energy prices, but the demand channel does affect them just at the margin. The thing about the United States is that we also have strong-in many other jurisdictions, the principal problem really is energy. In the United States, we also have a demand issue. We've got an imbalance between demand and supply, which you see in many parts of the economy. So our tools are well suited to work on that problem, and that's what we're doing. You're right, though. We don't-the price of oil is set globally, and it's not something we can affect. I think by the actions that we take, though, we help keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and keep the public believing in 2 percent inflation by the things that we do, even in times when energy is part of the story of why inflation is high. MICHELLE SMITH. Jonnelle. JONNELLE MARTE. Hi, Chair Powell. Jonnelle Marte with Bloomberg. So the Fed is facing two more ethics-related incidents with the revision of the financial statements from President Bostic and President Bullard speaking at a closed event. So some senators, like Elizabeth Warren, are saying that this is a sign of greater ethics problems at the Fed. Could you talk about what this does to the public's trust in the bank and what the Fed is doing to prevent this kind of behavior from becoming common? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So you're right-the public's trust is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset, and any time one of us, one of the policymakers, violates or falls short of those rules, we do risk undermining that trust, and we take that very seriously. We do. So at the beginning of our meeting yesterday, actually, we had a Committee discussion of the full Committee on the importance of holding ourselves individually and collectively accountable for knowing and following the high standard that's set out in our existing rules with respect to both personal investment activities and external communications. And we've taken a number of steps, and I would just say we do understand how important those issues are. I would say that our new investment program that we have is up now and running, and, actually, it was through that that the problems with President Bostic's disclosures were discovered, when he filed his new disclosure. We now have a central group here at the Board of Governors that looks into disclosures and follows them and approves people's disclosures and also all of their trades. Any trade anyone has to make is covered, has to be approved, preapproved, and there's a lag-it has to be preapproved 45 days before it happens, so there's no ability to game markets. So it's a really good system. It worked here. And we-I think we all said to each other today-yesterday, actually, yesterday morning, we recommitted to each other and to this institution to hold ourselves to the highest standards and avoid these problems. JONNELLE MARTE. Do you have an update on the investigations that are pending? CHAIR POWELL. I don't. So, as you know, I referred the matter concerning President Bostic to the inspector general, and once that happens, I don't discuss it with the inspector general or with anybody. It's just-the inspector general has, he has the ability to do investigations. We don't really have that. So that's what he's doing. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. Earlier this year, you touted the three-month bill yield out to 18 months as the yield curve with 100 percent explanatory power. And you said, quote, ""If it's inverted, that means the Fed's going to cut, which means the economy is weak."" That curve is only 2 basis points away from inversion now, so I'm wondering why you are so confident that you have not overtightened, particularly given that rates work with a lag. CHAIR POWELL. Well, so we do monitor the near-term forward spread-you're right. And it's-that's been our preferred measure. We think, just empirically, it dominates the ones that people tend to look at, which is 2s, 10s, and things like that. So it's not inverted. And, also, you have to look at why things-why the rate curve is doing what it's doing. It can be doing that because it affects-it expects cuts or because it expects inflation to come down. In this case, if you're in a situation where the markets are pricing in significant declines in inflation, that's going to affect the forward curve. So, yes, we monitor it. You're right. And that's what I would say. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up: You also said several meetings ago that the risk of doing too little outweighed the risk of doing too much. Is what you're trying to tell us today is that that risk assessment has changed a little bit? CHAIR POWELL. Well, what's happened is, time has passed, and we've raised interest rates by 375 basis points. I would not-I would not change a word in that statement, though. I think until we get inflation down, you'll be hearing that from me. Again, if we overtighten-and we don't want to, we want to get this exactly right-but if we overtighten, then we have the ability with our tools, which are powerful, to, as we showed at the beginning of the pandemic episode, we can support economic activity strongly if that happens, if that's necessary. On the other hand, if you make the mistake in the other direction and you let this drag on, then it's a year or two down the road, and you're realizing, inflation behaving the way it can, you're realizing you didn't actually get it, you have to go back in. By then, the risk, really, is that it has become entrenched in people's thinking. And the record is that the employment costs-the cost to the people that we don't want to hurt-they go up with the passage of time. That's really how I look at it. So that isn't going to change. What has changed, though-you're right-is, we're farther along now. And I think as we're farther along, we're now focused on that. What's the place, what's the level we need to get to rates? And I don't know what we'll do when we get there, by the way. It doesn't-we'll have to see. There's been no decision or discussion around exactly what steps we would take at that point. But the first thing is to find your way there. MICHELLE SMITH. Chris Rugaber. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Just to go back to housing for a minute: You mentioned the impact that rate increases have had on housing-home sales are down 25 percent in the past year, and so forth-but none of this is really showing up in, as you know, in the government's inflation measures. And as we go forward, private real-time data is clearly showing these hits to housing. Are you going to need to put a greater weight on that in order to ascertain things like whether there's overtightening going on, or will you still focus as much on the more lagging government indicators? CHAIR POWELL. So this is an interesting subject. So I start by saying, I guess, that the measure that's in the CPI and the PCE, it captures rents for all tenants, not just new leases. And that makes sense, actually, because for that reason-conceptually, that is-that's sort of the right target for monetary policy. And the same thing is true for owners' equivalent rent, which comes off of-it's a reweighting of tenant rents. The private measures are, of course, good at picking up, at the margin, the new leases, and they tell you a couple things. One thing is, I think right now, if you look at the pattern of that series of the new leases, it's very pro-cyclical, so rents went up much more than the CPI and PCE rents did. And now they're coming down faster. But what you're-the implication is that there are still, as people, as non-new leases roll over and expire, right, they're still in the pipeline, there's still some significant rate increases coming, okay? But at some point, once you get through that, the new leases are going to tell you-what they're telling you is, there will come a point at which rent inflation will start to come down. But that point is well out from where we are now. So we're well aware of that, of course, and we look at it. But I would say that in terms of-the right way to think about inflation, really, is to look at the measure that we do look at, but considering that we also know that at some point, you'll see rents coming down. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great, and just a quick follow. It looks like stock and bond markets are reacting positively to your announcement so far. Is that something you wanted to see? Is that a problem or what-how that might affect your future policy to see this positive reaction? CHAIR POWELL. We're not targeting any one or two particular things. Our message should be-what I'm trying to do is make sure that our message is clear, which is that we think we have a ways to go, we have some ground to cover with interest rates before we get to, before we get to that level of interest rates that we think is sufficiently restrictive. And putting that in the statement and identifying that as a goal is an important step. And that's meant to put that question, really, as the important one now, going forward. I've also said that we think that the level of rates that we estimated in September-the incoming data suggests that that's actually going to be higher, and that's been the pattern. I mean, I would have little confidence that the forecast-if we made a forecast today, if we were doing an SEP today, the pattern has been that, one after another, they go up, and that'll end when it ends, but there's no sense that inflation is coming down. If you look at the-I have a table of the last 12 months of 12-month readings, and there's really no pattern there. We're exactly where we were a year ago. So I would also say, it's premature to discuss pausing. And it's not something that we're thinking about. That's really not a conversation to be had now. We have a ways to go. And the last thing I'll say is that I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon. So those-I control those messages, and that's my job. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. Thank you, Fed Chairman. So how big of a headwind is all the fiscal spending to what the Federal Reserve's trying to do to get inflation back to the 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL. In theory, it was a headwind this year, but I do think the broader context is that you have households that have these significant amounts of savings and can keep spending even in-so I think those two things do tend to wage-to sort of counterbalance each other out. It appears, consumer spending is still positive-it's at pretty modest growth levels. It's not shrinking. The banks that deal with retail customers and many retailers will tell you that the consumers are still buying and they're still-they're fine. So I don't know how big the fiscal headwinds are, and they haven't shown up in the way that we thought they would in restraining spending. So it must have to do with the savings that people have. EDWARD LAWRENCE. So, what about the spending? There's tens of billions yet to be spent, I mean, from the Inflation Reduction Act, the American Rescue Plan, CHIPS Act, bipartisan infrastructure bill. How does that play into your thinking about the future? CHAIR POWELL. Demand is going to have some support from those savings and also from the strong demand that's still in the labor market. We still see pretty significant demand and a tightening labor market in some respects, although I think, overall, I would say it's not really tightening or loosening. So we see those things, and what those things tell us is that our job is going to require some resolve and some patience over time. We're going to have to stick with this. And that's just-we take all that as a given, but we know what our objective is, and we know what our tools can do, and that's how we think about it. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We'll go to Nancy for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace. I'm wondering, has the window for a soft landing narrowed? Do you still think it's possible? CHAIR POWELL. Has it narrowed? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. We've always said it was going to be difficult, but I think to the extent rates have to go higher and stay higher for longer, it becomes harder to see the path-it's narrowed. I would say the path has narrowed over the course of the last year, really. Hard to say. Hard to say. Again, I would say that the sort of array of data in the labor market is highly unusual and, to many economists, there is a path to-ordinarily there's a relationship to GDP going down and vacancies declining, translating into unemployment, or there's Okun's law. So all those things are relationships that are in the data, and they're very real. Data's a little bit different this time, though, because you have this tremendously high level of vacancies and, we think, on a very steep part of the Beveridge curve. All I would say is that the job losses may turn out to be less than would be indicated by those traditional measures, because job openings are so elevated and because the labor market is so strong. Again, that's going to be something we discover empirically. I think no one knows whether there's going to be a recession or not and, if so, how bad that recession would be. And our job is to restore price stability so that we can have a strong labor market that benefits all over time. And that's what we're going to do. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Just real quickly-why do you feel like the window has narrowed? CHAIR POWELL. Because we haven't seen inflation coming down. The implication of inflation not coming down. What we would expect by now to have seen is that as the-really, as the supply-side problems have resolved themselves, we would have expected goods inflation to come down by now, long since by now. And it really hasn't. Actually, it has come down, but not to the extent that we had hoped. At the same time, now you see services inflation, core services inflation moving up, and I just think that the inflation picture has become more and more challenging over the course of this year, without question. That means that we have to have policy be more restrictive, and that narrows the path to a soft landing, I would say. Thanks very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thanks for taking my question, Mr. Chairman. You just talked about the importance of market conditions reflecting the policy restraint you put in place. Since the November meeting, the 10-year has declined by 60 basis points, mortgage rates have come down, high-yield credit spreads have come in, the economy's accelerated, and the stock market's up 6 percent. Is this loosening of financial conditions a problem for the Fed in its effort, and its fight, against inflation? And, if so, do you need to do something about that? And how would you do something about that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we're putting in place to bring inflation down to 2 percent. We think that financial conditions have tightened significantly in the past year. But our policy actions work through financial conditions. And those, in turn, affect economic activity, the labor market, and inflation. So what we control is our policy moves in the communications that we make. Financial conditions both anticipate, and react to, our actions. I would add that our focus is not on short-term moves, but on persistent moves. And many, many things, of course, move financial conditions over time. I would say it's our judgment today that we're not at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance yet, which is why we say that we would expect that ongoing hikes would be appropriate. And I would point you to the SEP again for our current assessment of what that peak level will be. As you will have seen, 19 people filled out the SEP this time, and 17 of those 19 wrote down a peak rate of 5 percent or more-in the 5s. So that's our best assessment today for what we think the peak rate will be. December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 6 of 23 You will also know that, at each subsequent SEP during the course of this year, we've actually increased our estimate of what that peak rate will be. And today we're-the SEP that was published shows again that, overwhelmingly, FOMC participants believe that inflation risks are to the upside. So I can't tell you confidently that we won't move up our estimate of the peak rate again at the next SEP. I don't know what we'll do. It will depend on future data. What we're writing down today is our best estimate of what we think that peak rate will be, based on what we know. Obviously, if data-if the inflation data come in worse, that could move up. And it could move down if inflation data are softer. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. The SEP, like you mentioned, suggests that the Fed will be making another percentage points worth of rate increases in 2023. I wonder if you would foresee that being in 25 basis point increments, 50 basis point increments-sort of how you see the speed playing out going forward. And then I wonder what you're looking at as you determine when to stop. CHAIR POWELL. So, as I've been saying, as we've gone through the course of this year, as we lifted off and got into the course of the year and we saw the-how strong inflation was and how persistent, it was very important to move quickly. In fact, the speed-the pace with which we're moving was the most important thing. I think now that we're coming to the end of this year, we've raised 425 basis points this year, and we're into restrictive territory. It's now not so important how fast we go. It's far more important to think, what is the ultimate level? And then it's-at a certain point, the question will become, how long do we remain restrictive? That will become the most important question. But I would say the most important question now is no longer the speed. So-and that applies to February as well. So I December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 7 of 23 think we'll make the February decision based on the incoming data and where we see financial conditions, where we see the economy. And that'll be the key thing, but-I mean, for that decision. But, ultimately, that question about how high to raise rates is going to be one that we make looking at our progress on inflation, looking at where financial conditions are, and making an assessment of whether policy is restrictive enough. [As] I've told you today, we have an assessment that we're not at a restrictive enough stance, even with today's move. And we've laid out our own-our individual assessments of what we would need to do to get there. At a certain point, though, we'll get to that point. And then the question will be, how long do we stay there? And there, the strong view on the Committee is that we'll need to stay there, you know, until we're really confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way. And we think that that will be some time. Now, why do I say that? If you look at-you can break inflation down into three, sort of, buckets. The first is goods inflation, and we see now, as we've been expecting, really, for a year and a half, that supply conditions would get better. And, ultimately, supply chains get fixed, and demand settles down a little bit and maybe goes back to services a little bit. And we start to see goods inflation coming down. We're now starting to see that in this report and the last one. Then you go to housing services. We know the story there is that housing services inflation has been very, very high and will continue to go up, actually. As rents expire and have to be renewed, they're going to be renewed into a market where rates are higher than they were when the original leases were signed. But we see that the new leases that are-that the rate for new leases is coming down. So, once we work our way through that backlog, that inflation will December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 8 of 23 come down sometime next year. The third piece, which is something like 55 percent of the index, PCE core inflation index, is non-housing-related core services. And that's really a function of the labor market, largely. The biggest cost, by far, in that sector is labor. And we do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven't seen much softening, where job growth is very high, where wages are very high. Vacancies are quite elevated, and, really, there's an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand. So that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down. The other-you know, the goods inflation has turned pretty quickly now after not turning at all for a year and a half. Now it seems to be turning. But there's an expectation, really, that the services inflation will not move down so quickly, so that we'll have to stay at it, so that we may have to raise rates higher to get to where we want to go. And that's really why we are writing down those high rates and why we're expecting that they'll have to remain high for a time. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thanks for taking the question. You describe GDP growth in the SEPs as moderate or modest, I believe. Yet it's really approaching stall speed. Half a percentage point is not much. You described labor market unemployment rate as representing some softening. But it's nearly a full percentage point rise, and that's well in excess of what has historically been associated with recession. Why wouldn't this be considered a recessionary projection by the Fed? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I'll tell you what the projection is. I don't think it would qualify as a recession, though, because you've got positive growth. The expectations in the SEP are basically as you said, which is, we've got growth at a modest level, which is to say that December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 9 of 23 Â½ percentage point, that's positive growth. It's slow growth. It's well below trend. It's not going to feel like a boom. It's going to feel like very slow growth, right? In that condition, labor market conditions are softening a bit. Unemployment does go up a bit. I would say that many analysts believe that the natural rate of unemployment is actually elevated at this moment. So it's not clear that those forecasts of inflation are really much above the natural rate of unemployment. We can never identify its location with great precision. But that 4.7 percent is still a strong labor market. If you look-you know, you've got-the reports we get from the field are that companies are very reluctant to lay people off, other than the tech companies, which is, you know, a story unto itself. Generally, companies want to hold onto the workers they have because it's been very, very hard to hire. So you've got all these vacancies out there-far in excess of the number of employed people. That doesn't sound like a-you know, a labor market where a lot of people will need to be put out of work. So that we-you know, there are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment, we believe. None of that is guaranteed, but that is what their forecast reflects. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I want to follow up on Jeanna's question. The decision to step down the pace of rate increase-rate rises appears to have been socialized at your last meeting, largely before the past two CPI reports showed inflation decelerating in line with the Committee's forecasts this year. You just now talked about making decisions meeting by meeting and being mindful of the lags of policy. Does that mean, all things equal, you would feel more comfortable probing where the terminal rate is by moving in 25 basis point increments, including beginning at your next meeting? December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 10 of 23 CHAIR POWELL. So I haven't made a judgment on what size rate hike to make at the last meeting. But, you know, what you said is broadly right, which is, having moved so quickly and having now so much restraint that's still in the pipeline, we think that the appropriate thing to do now is to move to a slower pace. And, you know, that will allow us to feel our way and- you know, and get to that level, we think, and better balance the risks that we face. So that's the idea. It makes a lot of sense, it seems to me-particularly if you consider how far we've come. But, again, I can't tell you today what the actual size of that will be. It will depend on a variety of factors, including the incoming data in particular, the state of the economy, the state of financial conditions. NICK TIMIRAOS. With the CPI report, if it did come out last week, do you think it would have changed some of those forecasts in today's estimate? CHAIR POWELL. No. Absolutely not. No. As a-just a matter of practice, the SEP reflects any data that's-that comes out during the meeting. And participants know that they have the-they know this-that they can make changes to their SEP during the meeting, you know, well in advance of the press conference so that we're not running around. But that's not the case. It's never the case that the SEPs don't reflect an important piece of data that came in on the first day of the meeting. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thank you for taking our questions. I'm wondering if we could talk about the projection for the unemployment rate. Why has the Fed raised its unemployment projection? Is it because the model suggests that a higher terminal rate would automatically cause a higher unemployment December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 11 of 23 rate? Or are you seeing signs that the labor market isn't quite as strong as we think it is now? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. No. It's not about the strength of the labor market. The labor market is clearly very strong. It is more just that, you know, by now, we had expected-we've continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have, ultimately. And that's why the peak rate for this year goes up between this meeting and the September meeting. You see that-you see the fact that we've made less progress than expected on inflation. So that's why that goes up. And that's why unemployment goes up, because we're having to tighten policy more. And so it didn't go up by much in the meeting, I don't think. But that's the idea, is slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates probably held for longer just to get to where you-the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent. RACHEL SIEGEL. Do you have a sense of, in order to get to that number, how much of that could be caused by layoffs versus vacancies, trimming, or changes to the labor force population rate? CHAIR POWELL. It's very hard to say. You know, there-you can look at history, right? And history would, you know, would say that, in a situation like this, the declines in unemployment would be more meaningful, I think, than what you see written down there. But why do we think that is the case? So, I'll give you a few reasons. First just is that there's this huge overhang of vacancies, meaning that vacancies can come down a fair amount. And we're hearing from many companies that they don't want to lay people off-so that they'll keep people because it's been so hard. I mean, I think we've-it feels like we have a structural labor shortage out there where there are, you know, 4 million fewer people, a little more than 4 million who were in the December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 12 of 23 workforce available to work than there's demand for workforce. So the fact that there's a strong labor market, you know, means that companies will hold on to workers. And it means that it may take longer, but it also means that the costs in unemployment may be less. Again, that we're going to find out empirically. But I think that's a reasonably possible outcome. And you do hear, you know, many, many labor economists believe that it is. So we'll see, though. MICHELLE SMITH. Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. How should we interpret the higher core inflation forecast for 2023 in the SEP? Does that not then suggest that the policy rate currently forecasted for next year should actually be higher than the 5.1 median estimate penciled in? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think that's why one of the reasons it went up was that core came in stronger this year. Yeah. What you see is our best estimate, as of today-really, as of today-for how high we need to raise rates to-how much we need to tighten policy to create enough, you know, restrictive policy to slow economic activity and slow-soften the labor market and bring inflation down through those channels. That's all-that is the estimate-best estimate-we make today. And, as I mentioned, we'll make another estimate for the next SEP. And we'll, you know, of course, between meetings, we do the same thing, but we don't publish it. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to make sure I understand specifically what's going on in the SEP, because you all expect rates to go higher, but you're also more pessimistic about what inflation is going to look like next year. And I was just December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 13 of 23 wondering, you know, given that we have seen some cooling in inflation, you know, is it-is that primarily because of wage growth, that you expect wage growth to be sort of a headwind? CHAIR POWELL. We're going into next year with higher inflation than we had thought, right? So we're actually moving down to-the level that we're moving down to next year is still a very large drop in inflation from where inflation is running now, well more than 1 percent change in inflation. But remember that the jump[ing]-off point at the beginning of the year is higher. So, you know, we-we're moving down still by a very large chunk. I don't think it's having-I don't think the policy is having any less effect. It's just starting from a higher level at the end of 2022. So we're getting down. I believe the median is 3Â½ percent. That would be-that's a pretty significant drop in inflation. And, you know, where's it coming from? It's coming from the goods sector, clearly. By the middle of next year, we should begin to see lower inflation from the housing services sector. And then, you know, the big question is, when we-how much will you see from the largest, the 55 percent of the index, which is the non-housing services sector? And, you know, that's where you need to see-we believe you need to see a better balancing of supply and demand in the labor market so that you have-it's not that we don't want wage increases. We want strong wage increases. We just want them to be at a level that's consistent with 2 percent inflation. Right now that-if you put into-if you factor in productivity estimates, standard productivity estimates, wages are running, you know, well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Thanks. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. Some of your colleagues have been pretty explicit that they can't imagine rate cuts happening in 2023. That's December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 14 of 23 certainly not implied by the SEP. But futures markets have priced in some easing in the back half of next year. What's your view of the likelihood of any kind of rate cuts next year? What circumstances might make that plausible? CHAIR POWELL. You know, our focus right now is really on moving our policy stance to one that is restrictive enough to ensure a return of inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. It's not on rate cuts. And we think that we'll have to maintain a restrictive stance of policy for some time. Historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. I guess I would say it this way: I wouldn't see us considering rate cuts until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2 percent in a sustained way. So that's the test I would articulate. And you're correct. There are not rate cuts in the SEP for 2023. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Let me ask you about China. In the last few weeks, China has abandoned its COVID policy and been reopening pretty strongly. I'm wondering if you see that as disinflationary because you're seeing supply chains improve or inflationary because it obviously brings a lot more demand globally, improves the global outlook for growth and for commodities prices. CHAIR POWELL. So you're right. Those two things will offset each other. Weaker output in China will push down on commodity prices, but it could interfere with supply chains ultimately. And that could push inflation up in the West. It's very hard to say, you know, how much-how those two will offset each other. And it doesn't seem likely, actually, that the overall net effect would be material on us. But, to your point, China faces a very challenging situation in reopening. You know, we've seen, waves of COVID all around the world can interfere with economic activity. China, a very critical manufacturing-place for manufacturing December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 15 of 23 and exporting. Their supply chain is very important. And China faces a reopening. They've- you know, they've backed away from their COVID restriction policies. There could be very significant increases in COVID. And we'll just have to see. It's a risky situation. It-but, again, it doesn't seem like it's likely to have material overall effects on us. MICHELLE SMITH. Chris. CHRIS RUGABER. Hi. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. Thank you for taking my question. I wondered if you could comment a bit more about yesterday's inflation report. I mean, it showed inflation cooling in all three of the categories that you laid out at Brookings. Are you starting to see-are you confident that you're seeing real progress on getting inflation under control? Are you still worried it could slip into some kind of unentrenched, you know, upward spiral? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So the data that we've received so far for October and November, we don't have the-some of the-we have some remaining data to get in November, but they clearly do show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. As I mentioned in my opening statement, it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path. So the way we think about this is this: This report is very much in line with what we've been expecting and hoping for. And what it does is, it provides greater confidence in our forecast of declining inflation. As I mentioned, we've been expecting significant-forecasting significant declines in overall inflation and core inflation in the coming year. And this is the kind of reading that it will take to support that. So, really, this gives us greater confidence in our forecasts rather than, at this point, changing our forecast. In terms of the pieces, we have been expecting goods inflation to come down as supply chain pressures eased. That's happening now. Housing services-as I December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 16 of 23 mentioned, there's good news in the pipeline. As long as housing-new housing leases show declining inflation, that will show up in the measure around the middle of next year. So that should help. And the big piece, again, is core services, ex housing, which is very important. And we have a ways to go there. You do see some beginning signs there. But, ultimately, that's the big-the more than half, as I mentioned, of PCE core index. And it's very fundamentally about the labor market and wages. If you look at wages, look at the average hourly earnings number we got with the last payrolls report, you don't really see much progress in terms of average hourly earnings coming down. Now, there may be composition effects and other effects in that. So we don't put too much weight on any one report. These things can be volatile month to month. But we will be looking for wages moving, you know, down to more normal levels where workers are doing well and, ultimately, their gains are not being eaten up by inflation. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. There's a-excuse me, Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. There's a little bit of a disconnect between the optimistic view you just expressed about the economy and the changes that you've made in the SEP. And I'm wondering if you're reacting to the fact that the markets have loosened financial conditions or if you feel the Fed may be a little bit behind on inflation, whether the recent disinflation we're seeing is transitory or not, and how this affects the idea of a soft landing if you're projecting just Â½ percent growth for this year. CHAIR POWELL. So if I-I think I got your question. So, you know, one thing is to say is, I think our policy's in-getting into a pretty good place now. We're restrictive, and I think we're-you know, we're getting close to that level of sufficient-we think-sufficiently December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 17 of 23 restrictive. We laid out today what our best estimates are to get there. And, I mean, it boils down to, how long do we think this process is going to take? And, of course, we're-we welcome these better inflation reports for the last two months. They're very welcome. But I think we're realistic about the broader project. So that's all. That's the point I would make. It's-you know, we see goods prices coming down. We understand what will happen with housing services. But the big story will really be the rest of it, and there's not much progress there. And that's going to take some time. I think my view and my colleagues' view is that this will take some time. We'll have to hold policy at a restrictive level for a sustained period so that, you know, two good-you know, two good monthly reports are, you know, very welcome. Of course, they're very welcome. But we need to be honest with ourselves that there's, you know, inflation-12-month core inflation is 6 percent CPI. That's three times our 2 percent target. Now, it's good to see progress. But let's just understand we have a long ways to go to get back to price stability. MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, do you think the soft landing is no longer achievable? CHAIR POWELL. No, I wouldn't say that. No. I don't say that. I mean, I would say this: You know, to the extent we need to keep rates higher and keep them there for longer and inflation, you know, moves up higher and higher, I think that narrows the runway. But lower inflation readings, if they persist, in time, could certainly make it more possible. So I just-I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to have a recession or not and, if we do, whether it's going to be a deep one or not. It's just, it's not knowable. And certainly, you know, lower inflation reports, were they to continue for a period of time, would increase the likelihood of a- put it this way, of a return to price stability that involves significantly less of an increase in unemployment than would be expected given the historical record. December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 18 of 23 MICHELLE SMITH. Brian. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, NBC News. You warned Americans of pain earlier this year as the Fed hikes rates. But with the Fed now expected to raise rates higher than you thought when you first said that, just wondering where we are in that pain. How would you describe that to Americans if the projections on unemployment find themselves-that'd be 1.6 million Americans out of jobs? CHAIR POWELL. So the largest amount of pain-the worst pain would come from a failure to raise rates high enough and from us allowing inflation to become entrenched in the economy so that the ultimate cost of getting it out of the economy would be very high in terms of employment, meaning very high unemployment for extended periods of time, the kind of thing that had to happen when inflation really got out of control and the Fed didn't respond aggressively enough or soon enough in a prior episode, you know, 50 years ago. So that's really-the worst pain would be if we failed to act. What we're doing now is, you know, it's raising interest rates for people. And so people are paying higher rates on mortgages and that kind of thing. There will be some softening in labor market conditions. And I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability. There isn't. And this is the best we can do. I do think, though, that-and markets are pretty confident, it seems to me-that we will get inflation under control. And I believe we will. We're certainly highly committed to do that. MICHELLE SMITH. Grady. GRADY TRIMBLE. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Grady Trimble with Fox Business. You've reiterated today and the Committee has reiterated its commitment to that 2 percent inflation December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 19 of 23 target. I wonder, is there ever a point where you actually reevaluate that target and maybe increase your inflation target if it is stickier than even you think it is? CHAIR POWELL. That's just-so, changing our inflation goal is just something we're not thinking about, and it's something we're not going to think about. It's-we have a 2 percent inflation goal, and we'll use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent. I think this isn't the time to be thinking about that. I mean, there may be a longer-run project at some point. But that is not where we are at all. The Committee-we're not considering that. We're not going to consider that under any circumstances. We're going to keep our inflation target at 2 percent. We're going to use our tools to get inflation back to 2 percent. MICHELLE SMITH. Nicole. NICOLE GOODKIND. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Nicole Goodkind, CNN Business. As you monitor wage growth and unemployment data, I wonder if you're paying close attention to a sector or even income level? Like, how do you factor potential exacerbations of inequality into your risk calculations, especially given the K-shaped recovery of 2020? CHAIR POWELL. So the-I would go back to the labor market that we had in 2018, '19, '20. So, what that looked like was, wage increases for the people at the lowest end of the income spectrum were the largest. The gaps between racial groups and gender groups were at their smallest in recorded history. That's-and all of that because of a tight labor market, a tight labor market which had inflation running, you know, just a tick below 2 percent and the economy growing right at its potential. So that seems like something that would be really good for the economy and for the country, if we could get back to that. And so that's what all of us want to do. We want to get back to a long expansion where the labor market can remain strong over an extended period of December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 20 of 23 time. That's a really good thing for workers in the economy. And we'd love to get back to that. That's what our goal is. You know, there's-in the near term, we have to use our tools to restore price stability. But we, you know, we can't-what we have to think about is the medium and longer term. If you think about it, the country went through a difficult time-I think much more difficult than we can think it would happen here. But it really set up our economy for several decades of prosperity. So price stability is something that really pays dividends for the benefit of the economy and the people in it over a very, very long period of time. And so when it is lost, for whatever reason, it has to be restored and as quickly as possible-which is what we're doing. NICOLE GOODKIND. In the short term, are you factoring in these exacerbations or potential exacerbations in the economy? Are you monitoring them? CHAIR POWELL. We do, yes. We absolutely do. We look at-it's our regular practice to talk about unemployment rates by different groups, including racial groups and that sort of thing. We do. We keep our eye on that. MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. What would you do if the economy slows so much that we enter a recession before we see strong consistent signs that inflation is slowing-in other words, stagflation? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't want to get into too many hypotheticals. But, you know, we'll-it's hard to deal with hypotheticals. So let me just say that we have to use our tools to support maximum employment and price stability. I've made it clear that right now, the labor market's very, very strong. You're near a 50-year low where you're at or above maximum employment, a 50-year low in unemployment, vacancies are very high, wages-nominal wages December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 21 of 23 are very high. So the labor market's very, very strong. Where we're missing is on the inflation side. And we're missing by a lot on the inflation side. So that means we need to really focus on getting inflation under control, and that's what we'll do. I think, as the economy heals, the two goals come more into play. But right now, clearly, the focus has to be on getting inflation down. MICHELLE SMITH. Greg. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. You spoke a little bit ago. You said that the U.S. looks-it looks like we have a structural labor shortage in the economy. Could you expand on that, talk a little bit more about that? And, really, are you talking about getting Congress action on increasing, like, legal immigration, things like that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, what I meant by that, with ""structural labor shortage,"" is, if you look at where we are now, as I mentioned, there-if you just look at demand for labor, you can look at vacancies plus people who are actually working. And then you can take supply of labor by, ""Are you in the labor market?"" ""Are you looking for a job or have a job?"" And you're 4- more than 4 million people short. We don't see-despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market, we don't see participation moving up-which is contrary to what we thought. So the upshot of all that is, the labor market is actually-it should-it's 3Â½ million people, at least, smaller than it should have been based on pre-pandemic. Just assume population and reasonable growth and aging of the population; our labor force should be 3Â½ million more than it is. And that-there're lots of easy ways to get to bigger numbers than that if you go back a few more years. So why is that? Part of it is just accelerated retirements. People dropped out and aren't coming back at a higher rate than expected. Part of it is that we lost a half a million December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 22 of 23 people who would have been work-close to half a million who would have been working died from COVID. And part of it is that migration has been lower. We don't prescribe-you know, it's not our job to prescribe things. But, you know, I think if you ask businesses, you know, pretty much everybody you talk to says there aren't enough people. We need more people. So I tried to identify that in my-in a speech I gave a month ago, but I stopped short of telling Congress what to do because, you know, they gave us a job. And we need to, you know, do that job. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Jennifer. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. You say you expect growth of just Â½ percent next year. Given that you've said the process of raising rates and getting inflation back under control will be painful, have you had discussions within the Committee and addressed how long and/or how deep of a recession you would be willing to accept? CHAIR POWELL. No. I mean, what we do is, we make our forecasts, and we publish them quarterly. And, you know, if you look at those forecasts, those are forecasts for slow growth, for a softening labor market, by which I mean, unemployment goes up but not a great deal. And you see inflation coming down. You see rates going up a lot. You see inflation coming down. Those are those forecasts, and that's really what they show. We're not-of course, we don't talk about, you know, this kind of a recession and that kind of a recession. We just, you know, we make those forecasts. The staff runs-and you will see this if you look at the old Tealbooks-runs alternative simulations of all different kinds at every meeting, and we look at those, too. And those will explore different things. But that's just, you know, upside and downside scenarios. Of course, that's a responsible practice that December 14, 2022 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 23 of 23 we've carried on for many decades. But, no, we don't-we haven't asked ourselves that question. MICHELLE SMITH. We'll go to Jean for the last question. JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask about the SEP again. If you're reaching peak rates around 5 percent in the first half of next year and inflation starts to decline materially, that would seem to make the real rate gradually more restrictive. Is that something that's built into the projections and into models? Is that something you would want to see? CHAIR POWELL. So we do know that. Of course, that's something that we know we'd see. But, as I mentioned, you know, we wouldn't-I wouldn't see the Committee cutting rates until we're confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way. That would be my test. I don't see us as having a really clear and precise understanding of what the neutral rate is and what real rates are so that it would mechanically happen like that. It would-really, it'll be a test of-for cutting rates, I think, in the event, it'll be a question of, do we actually feel confident that inflation is coming down in a sustained way? Thank you very much."
