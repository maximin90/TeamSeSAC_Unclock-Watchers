"STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman-- right, the microphone. Mr. Chairman, welcome. Interesting changes in the forecast. A higher growth forecast a full point above the long run, lower unemployment seven-tenths below the long run, and yet very little change in inflation. What does that say about what you and the Committee believe about the inflation dynamic? And how is it that, in that context, you justify three rate hikes this year-- and I sense there'll be three next year-- and a full $600 billion, I guess, annual rate decline in the balance sheet? Where's your biggest concern here? Is it in overkill when it comes to rates or underkill? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, you're right that the outlook did improve, as I mentioned and as you-- as was in your question. The Committee's estimates of growth went up, the Committee's estimates of unemployment went down, and there was a very slight increase in inflation. And I think that reflects, essentially-- if you think back to the era after the crisis, unemployment was 10 percent. It's now 4.1 percent. You've only seen very gradual upward pressures on inflation and wages despite that very large increase. And that suggests that the relationship between changes in slack and inflation is not so tight. But, it has diminished, but it's still there. So I think when you see those small changes in unemployment, that simply reflects the, you know, the flatness of the Phillips curve, if you will. STEVE LIESMAN. And your biggest concern or your biggest risk here-- is it doing too much, doing too little? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I think we're trying to, we're trying to be, to take the middle ground there. So, you know, on the one hand, the risk would be that we wait too long, and then we have to raise rates quickly, and that foreshortens the expansion. We don't want to do that. The-- on the other side, if we-- if we raise rates too quickly, inflation, then, really doesn't get sustainably up to 2 percent, and, that will hurt us going forward. We need that, and it's, you know, we need to make sure that inflation expectations are anchored at 2 percent. So we're trying to take that middle ground, and the Committee continues to believe that the middle ground consists of further gradual increases in the federal funds rate as long as the economy is broadly on this path. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. I'm Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, I want to ask about the symmetric inflation target-- what you outlined in your remarks as preventing persistent deviations. I want to understand what symmetry means in the context of inflation being allowed to run above the 2 percent target now that that's part of the projection for-- at least for core PCE next year. How do you define symmetric relative to the experience of the past five years? Would the Fed be willing to accept the type of overshoot of its target as it has seen during the undershoot? And how high above 2 percent is too high to maintain a target that is symmetric? Is it 2-1/4, 2Â½, 2-3/4? And also, for how long? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, so as you noted, the-- what we've said in the longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy is that we would be concerned with sustained or persistent deviations of inflation either above or below. We've also said-- in minutes and in speeches and things like that-- that that is a symmetric objective. So, that's how we think of it. And, I think it's-- I wouldn't characterize what we've done over the last five years as tolerating, you know, an undershoot of inflation. We were always pushing toward 2 percent, and I think that is how we look at it. I can't give you an exact number. It just, you know, it, we haven't agreed on that. It just is that we're always going to be seeking 2 percent inflation. And in doing that, we're going to be considering, by the way, the other side of the mandate. You know, we have to balance that against the deviation of employment from-- unemployment from its goal. And-- and also, just the duration of it as well. JIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times. Even with the extra fiscal stimulus of the tax cuts, your median growth projection is just up to 2.7 percent, and then-- this year-- and then drops back down to 2 percent by 2020. Is the continued talk in Washington about tax cuts bringing growth to 3 percent or higher on a sustained basis overselling their potential impact? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, let me say what that really is. So the Summary of Economic Projections is really a compilation of the individual rate forecasts. The Committee made really one decision at this meeting, and that was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The Summary of Economic Projections is individual forecasts compiled and written down. And, you've identified the median as 2.7 percent. I would-- and that's an interesting statistic. I would also say that the central tendency is interesting. The full range is interesting. So you have a range of views around the table. One of the great benefits of our system is that we do have Reserve Banks with their own staffs and Governors with different views, and so we discuss these things. So the Committee doesn't vote or agree upon the medians, so you're going to have a range of views. That's really all I can say-- 2.7 just happens to be the median for '18, but it doesn't really say, you know, what we think is possible. JIM PUZZANGHERA. But do you think you can get to 3 percent on a sustained basis? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would say it's hard to say, but it would take-- you know, that is well above almost all estimates, current estimates of potential long-run growth. It would take, you know, significant increases in productivity and labor force participation to get there. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg News. So obviously you guys reduced your NAIRU estimates slightly today, but if you continue to see job gains around 200,000 a month, primary labor participation rising slightly, pretty sustainably, you know, moderate wage increases, at what point are you guys going to start to question whether you're actually overshooting full employment? And, if you start to question that, how is that going to impact policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I guess I'd start by saying that the natural rate of unemployment is not something that we can observe directly. We look at a wide range of indicators on that-- you know, 15 or 20 of them at least. And also, I think we all understand that any point estimate is surrounded by very wide uncertainty bands. So as the-- as the actual unemployment rate has declined from 10 percent to 4.1 percent, the Committee's median estimate of the natural rate of unemployment has also declined by a full percentage point. So the Committee-- and, I think, people-- are generally influenced by data. As they see unemployment going lower, they're looking at a variety of aspects of the labor market, including wage inflation and price inflation. So I don't think we, we-- we're mindful of the uncertainty of that, and we'll be looking at that. So, as-- if inflation-- if unemployment does continue to go down, we'll continue to do that. As I mentioned earlier, there is no-- there's no sense in the data that we're on the cusp of an acceleration of inflation. We have seen moderate increases in wages and price inflation, and we seem to be seeing more of that. We'll be alert to that. I guess the idea-- the theory would be that if you get below the sustainable rate of unemployment for a sustained period, you would see an acceleration of inflation. So we would know that then, and we're very alert to it, but it's not something we observe at the present. SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from Financial Times. You and other policymakers have talked about headwinds turning into tailwinds recently. Does that imply that you think now a higher neutral rate of interest is operative in the U.S. economy, and how would you assess the implications for monetary policy? And second question-- this is obviously your first press conference, so it's a little early to ask this question, but would you like to do this more often? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Longer-run values like the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment, the potential growth rate of the economy are pinned down by slow-moving forces over time. So they don't-- they don't move around very much. So I wouldn't expect the Committee's, you know, predictions or projections or estimates of those values to move quickly. They'll move slowly. So is it possible that the neutral rate of interest would move up because of, for example, greater fiscal expansion? There's literature that says that. There's-- there are reasons that that might be the case. In fact, it did tick up one-tenth, as you all know, in the-- in the median at this time. But it's-- I think, generally speaking, the Committee sees the neutral rate of interest as still quite low and is not-- is not seeing it as having moved up and is open to the possibility that it will. SAM FLEMING. And press conferences? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Ah, press conferences. So that's something that I'm going to be carefully considering. I have not made a decision about it. My colleagues and I are committed to communicating as clearly as possible about what we're doing and why we're doing it. I would want to think very carefully about it and make sure that no one would take more frequent press conferences as a signal of the path of policy. And so, it is something that I'll be thinking about. ADAM SHAPIRO. Adam Shapiro with the Fox Business Network. You brought up the fiscal stimulus and the impact it's having, and I was curious, how is the change in the federal budget deficit-- because the stimulus is coming with great debt-- has it changed your approach to how many securities you're going to allow to roll off the balance sheet, and is there a level of Treasury supply at which the Fed would consider adjusting its balance sheet roll-off, given how much the U.S. government's going to have to borrow going forward? And, then a second question, things beyond your control-- the President is expected to announce new tariffs against China, and does the Committee discuss what potential impacts that could have in regards to inflation? And do you have a timeline as to how you would respond to that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, in terms of the balance sheet, we've said that, you know, we carefully developed this plan. We carefully socialized it in a series of meetings last year. We announced it, and we said we wouldn't change it, really, unless there were a significant downturn that required, you know, meaningful reductions in interest rates. And I have no inclination to revisit that. We're going to use monetary policy as the principle tool of adjusting, you know, our policy. So, on the second question, on tariffs, a number of participants in this FOMC did bring up the issue of tariffs, and if I could summarize what came out of that, it was, first, that there's no thought, I think, that changes in trade policy should have any effect on the current outlook. Second thing is, I would say, is that a number of participants reported in-- about their conversations with business leaders around the country and reported that trade policy has become a concern going forward for that group. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. You talked about the fact that the Summary of Economic Projections is based on the outlook of all the members of the FOMC. Can you tell us anything, though, about the staff forecast and how that was impacted by the-- we had a $1-1/2trillion tax cut, we've had $300 billion in increased government spending-- the staff forecast that you're working with, are those reflected-- how were they impacted by that? And how did that impact the discussions? CHAIRIMAN POWELL. So we look at the staff forecasts and the Board forecasts-- and, by the way, there are 12 excellent Reserve Bank staffs who have their own views and do their own work-- we look at those as informing the decisions of the policymakers. So-- and it's really the policymakers' views that we talk about in the SEP. We don't-- we don't, you know, talk about the staff forecast. It's a particular thing under-- done under particular rules and circumstances. And, really, it's the policymakers that then take that as input and create their forecasts, which are what drive policy. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. That had no impact, though? It's such a-- that's a major increase in government stimulus that you're-- that had to have had an impact on the discussions, I would think, though. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, the-- you're right. So fiscal stimulus is a, you know, a meaningful input into, you know, into the SEP and particularly in the changes over the course of last year and this year. And individual policymakers went through, with their staffs, a range of estimates, a range of literature, and did their own thinking and came up with their own estimates and submitted those as their Summary of Economic Projections-- as their projections. Those are not the staff's projections. Those are our projections. HEATHER LONG. Heather Long, Washington Post. I-- what will it take to get to four rate hikes this year? It's clear from the dot plot that many members do think four would be appropriate, but clearly something was holding a number of the FOMC members back. Is it concerns about these potential trade tariffs that are going into effect? Is it just that people want to wait and see a little longer before they raise? Can you give us some more insight into why people didn't go to four this time-- the median-- even though the economic projections look very healthy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I would go back to the thought that, you know, we made one decision at this meeting, and that decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. The projections are really just individual projections that are submitted and then compiled. And, you know, you're mentioning the median as being, you know, three and four being close, but, you know, I think, like any set of forecasts, those forecasts will change over time, and they'll change depending on the way the outlook for the economy changes. So that's really all I can say. It could change up. It could change down. I wouldn't want to-- for now, these are the best forecasts that people could make, and, you know, it could be that if the economy's a little bit stronger or a little bit weaker, then the path could be a little less gradual or a little more gradual. HEATHER LONG. So it wasn't one factor that was pulling at the heart of the discussion? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Not, no. JIM TANKERSLEY. Mr. Chairman, a quick follow on the trade question, and then a productivity question. On trade, what would have to happen in policy-- and, in particular, in potential retaliation from countries around the world-- for trade policy to become a concern for the Committee's outlook? And then, the second question is, you mentioned productivity growth earlier. What's your current assessment of the path of productivity growth, and has anything in policy-- any policy change in recent months changed that assessment? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, for trade, what I mentioned is that our FOMC participants reported in that they had heard, you know, concerns, which were relatively new, about-- about future trade actions, really. And they're seeing it as a risk-to-the-outlook kind of thing. So-- and the kind of things people are talking about would be, you know, more widespread retaliation and more widespread actions back-and-forth kind of thing. I can't be any more specific than that. In terms of productivity-- productivity, as I'm sure you know, has been very weak since the financial crisis. It's averaged only about 0.5 percent a year for the last six years, I guess. So that's well below, you know, longer-run averages, and it would certainly be a good thing to see it move up. It has moved up just a little bit but not, kind of, decisively. And, you know, you asked me about fiscal policy and the connection to productivity. I think in the tax bill there's-- there are incentives for-- there-- a tax cut bill that allows expensing of investments should encourage additional investment that should encourage productivity. In theory, an individual tax bill that lowers tax rates should encourage more labor force participation. So I do think it's very important that we have a focus on productivity in the country. It's not something that we can really do at the Fed, but, you know, we're certainly hopeful that there will be supply-side effects like that from the tax bill. I think estimates are really all over the place in terms of the amount and the timing of those. JONATHAN SPICER. Chairman Powell, Jonathan Spicer with Reuters. I take your caveats on the dot plot, as it were, but I'll ask another question. In 2020, it shows that policymakers expect the policy rate to get up almost to 3-1/2percent, which is quite a ways-- or, definitively, anyways-- above the neutral rate. Does that increase the risk of a Fed-induced recession and decrease the risk of a soft landing? Which is asking, in a way, about the fiscal policy. And, as a follow-up, is that fiscal stimulus starting to lead to questions within the Fed around this narrative of secular stagnation and the economy entering a new sort of ""low rates"" environment? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would say that-- remember that forecasts three years out-- so, you're right, in 2020 there's a-- I think it's 3.4 percent is the median of the SEP dots for 2020, which is 40 basis points above the estimates of the neutral rate, which I would characterize as, you know, modestly restrictive, modestly tightening policy, but that's three years in the future. It's highly uncertain. You know, we don't have the ability to see that far into the future, so I really wouldn't put a lot in that. It could make sense. You could imagine narratives in which that would make sense, but I honestly I wouldn't put too much on that. Sorry, your second question was? JONATHAN SPICER. The second question was whether the secular stagnation narrative-- whether fiscal policy is being questioned by the Fed around that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we've been through many years of growth around 2 percent, and I've given a number of public remarks where I've called on, you know, the country to focus more on potential growth and productivity and labor force participation, which drive potential growth. So, you know, I think it's really important that we do something-- do what we can as a country to increase our potential growth rate. I would say in the bill that passed Congress, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there were elements that should encourage productivity, as I mentioned-- sorry, encourage investment, which should help productivity, encourage labor force participation. We don't know how big those effects are going to be. We don't know what the timing would be. I think, as you look around the table at the FOMC, there's a wide range of views on the amount and the timing of those. I think all of us would agree that we hope that they will be large. MICHAEL DERBY. Hi. Mike Derby from Dow Jones Newswires. I have a question about the future of the mechanics of monetary policy. I wanted to know whether you favor sticking with the system that you have now of keeping interest on excess reserves and reverse repo-- the reverse repo rate to control interest rates-- or do you want to shift back to the old way of doing things at some point of targeting the fed funds market? And do you have any concern that if you do stick with the current system that, as rates rise, that you might see issues where the Fed is under-- is being criticized for paying out ever larger shares of money to banks to, you know, to control interest rates that some might perceive as a subsidy to the banks that are getting this money? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well. We have excellent control over rates, and it's working. And it's-- you described it accurately. We haven't made a decision to keep that as our longer-run framework. We haven't really addressed that question. We've had meetings where we've talked about it, and we've agreed that it's working well. But it's-- and it's not something I see us as needing to urgently address. I think we're continuing to learn about this framework. For example, one-- in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public's demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves. So we don't know what the demand is for reserves in a world where you have-- you know, you have regulations that require banks to hold lots of high-quality liquid assets, and reserves are one of those. So it's not something we're looking at resolving in the near term. You mentioned the question of interest on excess reserves, and I think it's a little bit of a misnomer to think that there's a subsidy there. We pay interest on excess reserves. We can't pay interest on excess reserves that are-- is above the general level of short-term interest rates. So we're paying rates that banks can get from other interest rates from other-- any other investment in the short-term money markets. In addition, remember that those liabilities-- those are our liabilities. The assets that we have on the other side are Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, which yield much higher than interest on reserves. So, in fact, it's not a subsidy, and it's not a cost to the taxpayer. GREG ROBB. Over here. Thank you, Chairman. Thank you very much. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Several of your colleagues recently have been speaking and expressing concern about financial imbalances and rising signs of financial imbalances. I was wondering if you could give us your view on the asset markets. Are-- do you see any bubbles? And do you have the tools you need, you think, to combat those? Thank you very much. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Since the financial crisis, we've been monitoring financial conditions and financial stability issues very carefully, and the FOMC receives regular briefings about the staff framework and, sort of, measures of various aspects of financial-- financial stability risks, and the current view of the Committee is that financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, let's say. And I'll go through a couple of pieces of that. So, if you look at the banking system, particularly the large financial institutions, you see higher capital. You see much higher liquidity. You see them more aware of their risks and better able to manage them with stress testing. And if one-- if something does go wrong, you've got-- you've got better ability to deal with the failure of those institutions. So, therefore, you don't see high leverage. You don't see excess risk-taking in great quantity the way you did see before the crisis. If you look at households, household balance sheets are in much better condition. If you look at nonfinancial corporations, you see-- you do see relatively elevated levels of borrowing, but nothing that suggests, you know, serious risks. And, of course, default rates are very low. So those readings look okay. I should mention also that for large financial institutions, they're no longer funded by a lot of short-term wholesale funding, which can disappear very quickly, so they're far less vulnerable to liquidity issues. Overall, those aspects, I think, suggest low levels of vulnerability. You identified the-- really, one area where-- which is an area of focus, which is asset prices. So, in some areas, asset prices are elevated relative to their longer-run historical norms. You can think of some equity prices. You can think of commercial real estate prices in certain markets. But we don't see it in housing, which is key. And so, overall, if you put all of that into a pie, what you have is moderate vulnerabilities, in our view. In terms of whether we have the tools, you know, we have some tools, and I think we certainly-- we use them. We have-- I think the stress test is a really important tool that we have for the largest financial institutions and for the smaller financial institutions. We regularly use that to-- as a way to test against various, you know, market shocks, certainly for the larger institutions. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. More on the regulatory side, you know, the Fed might soon be getting more power to decide exactly which regulations-- which stricter regulations to apply to banks with between $100 and $250 billion in assets. And so I had a couple of questions about that. So, for CCAR, those stress tests, since that's based around, you know, having a punitive penalty of potentially being able to restrict dividend payouts or stock buybacks, is there any kind of logistical challenge that could be posed if you don't have CCAR every year for certain banks? Is it possible to have CCAR not on an annual basis? And then, my other question is, you know, you've talked a lot about how size isn't the only thing that causes banks to pose systemic risk, and I was wondering, what other factors do you think would cause a bank to potentially pose a systemic risk? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay. So, this is a matter that Congress has under consideration. It's not something-- so Congress is looking at raising the threshold for applying enhanced financial standards to-- from $50 billion to $250 billion, while leaving us with the ability to reach below $250 billion and apply those standards where we think it's appropriate. And, you know, we haven't been shy about doing that, because, of course, one of the eight SIFIs is below 250 already. So we are fully prepared to do that. But this is a decision that's in the hands of Congress. It's not something that's been-- been taken. The version of the bill, I think, that passed the Senate did have-- did give us the ability to do supervisory stress tests periodically, as opposed to annually, is the language. We haven't made any decision about that at all. We would want to think very carefully about that, and, you know, we would-- whatever we do decide to do, we'd put that out for comment. Is it, you know, logistically possible? I would think it would be, but it's certainly not something that we've decided to do. And the second question you had was? VICTORIA GUIDA. About what causes banks to pose systemic risk beyond size. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. Well, it's-- I guess the next thing on the list would be activities. So, you know, we-- regular way commercial banks that do deposit taking and lending and don't speculate in markets, you know, that's one business model. Another business model might be, you know, if you think of a hedge fund, right? That's what they do. They're speculating on markets, and-- you know, so very different business models and different levels of risk and that sort of thing. So, that's-- that would be the next thing on the list. I mean, there would be a range of things, you know-- how well capitalized is the institution, but mainly those things. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. I'd like to go back to the idea of the additional growth that you're getting from the fiscal package and ask you how much you think comes from the supply side and how much from demand? You use words like ""might"" and ""should"" about what results should come from this process, but, around the table, did any of the presidents or Governors report that businesses are actually getting ready to spend? Is this something that's going to happen? Do we know that there's going to be a supply-side effect, or are you just guessing at this point? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Remember that there are 15 FOMC participants, and we-- each of us has his or her own forecast. So there's a real diversity of views on this, particularly on these fiscal issues. If I could try to summarize, it would be that, I think, broadly speaking, participants believe there will be meaningful increases in demand from the new fiscal policies for at least the next, let's say, three years. I think there's a general view as well that supply-side issues-- that there could be supply-side effects as well, and you would see that again through higher investment, driven by lower corporate tax rates and the expensing of some investment, which would drive-- tend to drive productivity over time. If you make investment more attractive, companies should do more of it. It's uncertain, though. I mean, I spent many years of my life working with companies and discussing-- and, you know, the cost of capital is one of many factors that they'll consider. It isn't the only factor or the principle factor, but it should result in more investment, and investment should drive productivity. At the same time, the-- you know, I mentioned labor supply. You should see some labor supply effects over time from lower individual effective tax rates. The whole thing is very uncertain, and particularly the supply-side effects should and would be expected to take longer to appear and would be less certain in amount. So that's really as good as you can go. And, you know, we've all looked at the literature carefully. We've all thought about it. We've discussed it with our in-house experts and come up with our own views, and they're disparate, but that's-- I'd say that's about where the-- where the views are. DONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair Powell. Donna Borak with CNN. Just to go back to trade policy, if you don't mind. You said that participants today generally are feeling that the trade policy shouldn't necessarily affect the current economic outlook, but I am wondering if there was any discussion-- if there are fears about inflationary effects, should there be trade barriers imposed? And, secondly, you know, we might be on the verge of a tit-for-tat trade war with China. Wondering what your thoughts are of how that might dampen the economic-- the global economic outlook going forward should that occur. CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, at this stage, what our FOMC participants discussed-- it wasn't-- it was-- it was just that this is a new risk that had been probably a low-profile risk, which has become, you know, a more prominent risk to the outlook. That's really what people were saying. They didn't get into talking about particular-- you know, whether it's inflation or growth or whatever it would be. So that's not something that did come up. You know-- your second question, sorry, was China? DONNA BORAK. Yes. I mean, in the event that the United States and China-- in the event that the U.S. and China end up in a tit-for-tat trade war, or any other retaliatory actions that are imposed elsewhere against the United States, what that means for the global economic outlook, and whether that was something that was discussed and are you worried about. CHAIMRAN POWELL. That didn't-- it's not something that came up in particular. And, let me say, you know, we don't do trade policy here at the Fed, and, you know, I would be reluctant to comment on any particular situation with any particular country. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Does the interest rate hike today suggest that Americans are being paid enough? Are you satisfied with the rate of wage growth right now? CHAIRMAN POWELL. As I mentioned, you know, we've had unemployment decline sharply since, I guess, 2010, when it peaked at 10 percent and down to 4.1 percent now, and we've seen only modest increases in wages. So, on the one hand, what wages should in theory represent is inflation plus productivity increases. You should get paid for your productivity plus inflation. And productivity's been very low. Inflation's been low. So these low wage increases-- in a sense, they do make sense in that-- from that perspective. On the other hand, as the market has tightened, as labor markets have tightened, and we hear reports of labor shortages and we see that, you know, groups of unemployed are diminishing, and the unemployment rate is going down, we haven't seen, you know, higher wages-- wages going up more. And I would-- I think I've been surprised by that, and I think others have as well. In terms of what's the right level, I don't think I have a view on what the right level of wages is, but I think we will-- we will know that the labor market is getting tight when we do see a more meaningful upward move in wages. VIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse. If the economy behaves as the Fed is predicting, by the time of the midterm elections, the rates will be-- keep on rising, and the prime rate will be above-- well above 5 percent, a level not reached in 10 years for what is a base of consumer credit. And we know that, historically, raising rates-- especially in campaign times-- has never been very popular in the White House. Does this prospect of a possible pressure and dichotomy of concerns keep you awake at night? CHAIRMAN POWELL. No. That doesn't keep me awake at night. We don't consider the election cycle. You know, we-- we're looking very carefully at our assigned responsibilities of maximum employment, stable prices, and that's really our focus. You can count on us to stay focused on the jobs that Congress has assigned us and count on us to use the tools we have to achieve them. You're right, that's the highest rate. By the way, I'm hearing this, the 10-year thing a few times these days, and it's true that rates are higher than they've been in 10 years. On the other hand, the economy's healthier than it's been since-- since before the financial crisis. So, it's a healthier economy than it's been in 10 years. The financial crisis, of course, was just really getting going 10 years ago. MYLES UDLAND. Thanks. Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance. Chair Powell, I'm curious if the Fed would be willing to tolerate an inverted yield curve. We continue to see the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year tighten, even with longer-term yields coming up since the beginning of the year. This is a dynamic that has typically preceded recessions, and we're likely to see shorter-term rates come up as the Fed continues to increase rates. So, I'm just curious if you guys have discussed that, if you'd be willing to push back against that, or if that's a dynamic you'd be comfortable with? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, it's an interesting question, and there are a range of views there. I think it's true that yield curves have tended to predict recessions if you look back over many cycles, but a lot of that was just situations in which inflation was allowed to get out of control, and the Fed had to tighten, and that put the economy into a recession. That's really not the situation we're in now, so I don't know that that's-- I don't know that-- I don't think that recession probabilities are particularly high at the moment, any higher than they normally are. But, having said that, I think it's-- there are good questions about what a flat yield curve or inverted yield curve does to intermediation. It's hard to find in the research data, but nonetheless, I think those are issues that we'll be watching carefully. Thank you very much."

"JIM TANKERSLEY. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jim Tankersley, New York Times. I have a question about inflation and a question about growth. On inflation, I'm curious if there's anything that's happened since March that has changed your assessment of the risk of inflation increases beyond what you forecast in the year to come. And, on growth, you mentioned fiscal policy is adding to growth, and I'm curious if you could break that down a little bit further for us and say-what effects do you think the recent tax cuts are having on growth? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So since-I wouldn't say anything has happened since March to really change the way I'm thinking about inflation or the way the Committee's thinking about inflation. We've seen inflation move very gradually up toward our 2 percent objective. And part of that has been just idiosyncratic things dropping out from last March, which were holding inflation-measured inflation-down. Part of it is just that continued tightening in the labor market and the economy more broadly is pushing inflation up. So we continue to think, and the Committee continues to think, that we are just about at our 2 percent goal but, as I mentioned, not ready to declare victory until we sustain that over time, which we haven't done yet. You also asked about fiscal policy, and there's a range of views on the Committee and, I think more broadly, a range of views among economists generally. But I can say that the Committee members-Committee participants-generally believe that the fiscal changes-and that includes both the tax cuts, individual and corporate, and the spending changes-will provide meaningful support to demand, significant support to demand over the course of the next three years. And the question-the other question is, what about the supply side? So it is-it makes sense that if you lower corporate tax rates and allow faster expensing of investment, you will encourage greater investment. That should drive productivity. That should increase potential output. So that really ought to happen as well. I think the amounts and the timing of that coming in are also quite uncertain. There's also the possibility that there would be more labor supply from lower individual tax rates, again, in amounts and in timing that might be more uncertain. So that's how the Committee generally is thinking about-about fiscal policy. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. So the Fed is about four interest rate increases, using the projections released today, away from what might be considered a neutral fed funds rate. And I wanted to ask how you're thinking about what to do once you get to neutral. Under what conditions would you decide, once you get there, that it's okay to stop raising rates? And under what conditions would you want to keep going? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So for many, many years, we've been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been-has been clear. As the economy has strengthened and as we've gradually raised interest rates, the question comes into view of, how much longer will you need to be accommodative? And how will you know? How will you know where-at what point policy will be neutral? Neutral meaning that interest rates are neither pushing the economy up nor trying to restrain it. So we know that we're getting closer to that neutral level. We don't have an exact sense of how that will be. So the Committee is discussing, very actively, the questions that you raise. And, really, it boils down to a question of, what is appropriate policy? And, you know, I-you asked, how will we know? So I think we'll be very carefully looking at incoming data on inflation, on financial readings, and on the labor market. We have to acknowledge that there are always wide uncertainty bands around the level of, for example, the natural rate of unemployment. But also, what is the neutral rate of interest? What is that rate of interest that pushes neither up nor down? So I think we-we'll be guided by incoming data on the economy and try to keep our minds open as we move forward. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. 2.1 percent above target for two and a half years starts to feel like some of the alternate frameworks that have been discussed here, be it price-level targeting or trying to set expectations higher so that you hit your 2. In deciding how symmetric is too symmetric, what sort of parameters are you using on that front? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, the-our target for-our medium-term objective for inflation is 2 percent PCE inflation. We feel that that target has served the economy well, and I'm strongly committed to it. The Committee is strongly committed to it. The sort of barriers to making a material change to that would be-would be very high because, again, we think it's fundamental, and we think it's worked. You asked about price-level targeting and that sort of thing. You know, there are some ideas that sort of take cognizance of the fact that rates are lower, we're near the zero lower bound, and that could put downward pressure on inflation expectations if we're going to be down at the zero lower bound and, therefore, sort of undermine the credibility of the 2 percent inflation objective. So the idea is to have kind of a makeup. If you-if you're below target for a while, you have a-you have a time of being above target. And the idea is to enhance the credibility of that 2 percent-that 2 percent target. This is an idea that's been written about for many years. It's not something that the Committee has looked at seriously. I imagine we will be having discussions about it, but-not something that we have on the calendar right now. SAM FLEMING. Well, thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Over the weekend, we saw some significant tensions within the G-7. In Canada, there is the potential, obviously, for further action against China right now and retaliatory action from major U.S. trading partners. How big a risk do you currently see this as being to the United States economy? And what kind of feedback are you getting in terms of corporate investment intentions? Is there something that's beginning to feature more prominently in your own discussions with major U.S. companies? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. I ought to start by saying that, you know, Congress has assigned us very important jobs and-you know, maximum employment, stable prices, we have a role in financial stability that we share with other agencies. Congress has very specifically given authority over trade to the executive branch, so I wouldn't comment on any particular specific trade actions. I will say that we, of course, have-we have broad contacts in-among business leaders around the country. And the Reserve Bank presidents, in particular, have that. And so they report in the Beige Book and then in person at the FOMC meeting. And they do come back and they say that concerns about changes in trade policy are arising, I think it's fair to say, and also that you're beginning to hear reports of companies holding off on making investments and hiring people. So right now we don't see that in the numbers at all. The economy is very strong. The labor market is strong. Growth is strong. We really don't see it in the numbers. It's just not there. But-so I would put it down as more of a risk. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, you said there's a difference of opinion among economists, but looking at the longer-run GDP growth rates for the members of the Committee, there's not a whole lot of difference. It's 1.8 to 2, or 1.7 to 2.1, depending upon how you count it. Is that showing us that not a single member of the Committee-including yourself, Mr. Chairman-agrees with economists over at the White House that they can achieve long-run sustained growth rates above or at 3 percent or higher? Do you believe in that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, first of all, that's a-that's a reasonable range, I think, of-it's not that we're all on the same number, but there are a range of views about potential growth. And there's so much uncertainty around this. You know, we don't-the thing about fiscal policy is, you don't have thousands of incidents to, you know, to-you don't have big data, in a way. You have very small data. You've got only a few instances here, so you have a lot of uncertainty around what the effects will be. They could be large. We hope they're large. But I think our approach is going to be to watch and see and hope that, in fact, we do get significant effects to, you know, to potential growth out of the tax bill, and we're just going to have to see. STEVE LIESMAN. How would you forecast it though? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I think we're looking at a reasonable range of estimates and we're putting every-different participants are putting different estimates in and we're going to be waiting and seeing. DONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. You said earlier that it's still a little too early to declare victory on inflation. I wanted to circle back on a question that was asked at the initial press conference about what-what does the Fed say in regards to the inflation target as symmetric? Like has the Committee given any further thought in terms of how comfortable it would be rising above-whether it goes higher than 2.1, if it reaches 2.2, 2.3, and for how long? And now that you're planning to hold these regular press conferences, starting next year, how do you explain-how do you plan to explain that to the American people that inflation is not overrunning? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, what we've said in our Statement of Longer-Run Principles and Monetary Policy Strategy is that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent, persistently above or below 2 percent. And that's what we mean by symmetric. We're looking at it equally on either side and it's a matter of persistent overruns. We know that inflation is going to bounce around. For example, as I mentioned, later this summer there's a good chance that headline inflation will move up above 2 percent because of oil prices. Things buffet inflation back and forth, but-so we acknowledge that, we understand that-and if inflation were to persistently run above or below 2 percent, then we would be using our tools to try to move inflation back in the direction of the target. We do understand, though, that we don't have the ability to precisely hit that target, so we expect that inflation will be above or below. And we just hope that that is-happens on a symmetric basis. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. At this meeting, you hiked your-the funds rate, you changed the dot plot to move from 3 to 4 for this year, and you took out a sentence that you'd been using for years about how long rates might stay low. But you say that none of this signals a change in policy views. But shouldn't we see from this combination of things that the Fed is moving to tighter policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I think what you should see is that the economy is continuing to make progress. The economy has strengthened so much since I joined the Fed, you know, in 2012 and even over the last couple of years. The economy is in a very different place. We- unemployment was 10 percent at the height of the crisis. It's 3.8 percent now and moving lower. So really what you-the decision you see today is another sign that the U.S. economy is in great shape. Growth is strong, labor markets are strong, inflation is close to target, and that's what you're seeing. For many years, as I mentioned-many years-we had interest rates held low to support economic activity. And it's been clear that as we've gotten closer to our statutory goals, we should normalize policy, and that's really what we've been consistently doing for some years now. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Chair Powell. Heather Long from the Washington Post. Can you give us an update on what the FOMC thinks about wages? Are we finally going to see that wage growth pickup this year? I know you're forecasting a little bit more inflation, but is that going to translate through to wage growth? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, wages have been gradually moving up. Earlier in the recovery, they were-there are many different wage measures, of course, but-so just-but just to generalize, wages were running roughly around 2 percent and they've moved gradually up into between 2 to 3 percent as the labor market has become stronger and stronger. I think it's fair to say that some of us-and I certainly would have expected wages to react more to the very significant reduction in unemployment that we've had, as I mentioned, from 10 percent to 3.8 percent. Part of that can be explained by low productivity, which is something we've talked about at the Committee and elsewhere. But, nonetheless, I think we had anticipated, and many people have anticipated, that wages-that in a world where we're hearing lots and lots about labor shortages-everywhere we go now, we hear about labor shortages-but where is the wage reaction? So it's a bit of a puzzle. I wouldn't say it's a mystery, but it's a bit of a puzzle. And, frankly, I do think there's a lot to like about low unemployment. And one of the things is-you will see-pretty much people who want to get jobs-not everybody-but people who want to get jobs, many of them will be able to get jobs. You will see wages go up. You'll see people at the, sort of, the margins of the labor force having an opportunity to get back in work. They benefit from that. Society benefits from that. So there are a lot of things to really like, including higher wages, as you asked. Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that-that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we're gradually raising rates. DON LEE. Just a follow-up on-Don Lee from the L.A. Times. On both inflation and unemployment, the new projections-for unemployment lower than before and inflation higher. And how much is the Fed willing to accept that's an overshoot for both of those before it affects policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You mentioned that unemployment moved down and inflation moved up by truly small amounts. If you look at the Summary of Economic Projections, things are moving by just a tick or even a semitick between now and March. And you asked, you know-I mean, I think we take a longer-run view that we're shooting for-we're aiming for-2 percent inflation-inflation around 2 percent. We know that it'll be above or below. We're not going to-we didn't overreact, I think, to inflation being under 2 percent. We won't overreact to it being over 2 percent. And I think we'll always be using our tools to move inflation in the direction of the target, if it-if it leaves-if it moves away from the target persistently, as I mentioned. In terms of unemployment, you know, you have to acknowledge that we are-no one really knows with certainty what the level of the natural rate of unemployment is, the rate that is sustainable over a long period of time. And we know that probably that rate has declined as the U.S. population has become more educated, as it has become older. Older and more educated people have lower unemployment rates. We don't know this with precision. So we have to be learning as we go. We've got to be looking at data and informed by what's coming in. And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the-by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we've learned-as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn't really reacted. So I can't give you a precise number, but I just-you know, we will be very much informed by incoming data. And this uncertainty is why-the fact that we live in that uncertainty is why we've been gradually raising rates. We're not waiting for inflation to show up. We're going ahead and moving gradually and trying to navigate between two risks, really. One would be moving too quickly-inflation never gets back to target if we do that. And the other is moving too slowly, and then we have-we have too much inflation or financial instability, and we have to raise quickly. And that can also have bad outcomes. CHRISTOPHER CONDON. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Mr. Chairman, I have a couple questions about the interest the Fed pays on excess reserves. And you mentioned, of course, that-that the IOER was raised by the Committee 20 basis points, and that's a result, as you said, of the upward drift of the effective fed funds rate in that target range. Do you think that that's going to resolve that issue or might there be further action required by the Committee in the future to continue lowering IOER relative to the midpoint of the range? And, further, was there discussion among the Committee today about what's causing that? Is it purely technical, perhaps related to bill issuance, or is it telling you something about the level of scarcity and truly excess bank reserves? Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Thanks. So I would say that-remember the important thing is that we want the federal funds rate to trade in the target range. That's the whole, the whole idea. IOER is the principal tool by which we assure that that will happen. And we've said in our, you know, basic documents that we will adjust the use of our tools, as appropriate. We don't expect to have to do this often or again, but we're not sure about that. If we have to do it again, we'll do it again. Again, don't expect it to happen. You asked why. And yes, you know, we-of course, we're looking carefully at that and, you know, the truth is we don't-we don't know with any precision. Really, no one does. It's-you can't run experiments, you know, with one effect and not the other. You know, I think there's a lot of probability on the idea of just high bill supply leads to higher repo costs, higher money market rates generally, and the arbitrage pulls up federal funds rate towards IOER. We don't know that that's the only effect and, you know, we're just going to have to be watching and learning. And, frankly, we don't have to know today. What we really need is to have the federal funds rate trade in the range, and that's what this minor technical adjustment accomplishes. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. So with the numbers that we're looking at, you talked about more people getting jobs, the wages are increasing. Are we seeing a-with the fiscal policy-a fundamental shift in the economy, where we have lower natural unemployment, also possibly a lower rate of natural unemployment and lower inflation? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Your question-your first question, really, is, do we think the natural rate of unemployment is lower? So I think we do believe it has moved down significantly over a long period of time. We don't think that the natural rate of unemployment-you know, it's not one of those variables that moves around a lot. It tends to be driven by slow-moving variables, like the education level, the population, like the functioning of the labor market, and things like that. So, you know, it may-it may have moved down too, on a cyclical basis, lower. As the economy gets hotter and hotter, there's some possibility of that. But, you know, the thing is, if you look back, there have been a lot of studies done and, you know, real-time estimates of the natural rate of unemployment have uncertainty bands, which are-which are quite wide, so we have to remember that and very much be guided by the-by the incoming data. You asked about inflation. You know, inflation we look about-we look at the 2 percent inflation objective as something that central banks, the Fed, really control. And we have to be strongly committed to achieving that using our tools to do that. I think in-in recent years the dominant force has been, you know, disinflationary-have been pushing down on inflation. And so we've been pushing back up. Of course, all those years when we were growing up, it was the opposite. Inflation was too high and central banks were constantly pushing down. It's really important that inflation not fall below 2 percent, that inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent-very important-because the implications of inflation below 2 percent are that you're closer to the zero lower bound, meaning the Fed has less room to cut, meaning that we'll spend more time there and we won't be able to do the job that we're assigned to do for our citizens. JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek with Bloomberg Television. You guys moved the median unemployment forecast for 2020 down to 3.5 percent but left the longer-run at 4.5 percent today. But you're only forecasting a moderate overshoot on the fed funds rate beyond your longer-run value. How are you going to get unemployment from 3.5 percent up to that 4.5 percent rate? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I would just-would-I would just emphasize, emphasize that-a couple things. First, we're learning about the real location of the natural rate of unemployment as we go. So it's moved down by more than a full percentage point since 2012. So it's not so simple as thinking, oh boy, we've just got to go ahead and get that rate up. If you-if you look at the forecast, two years from now, end of 2020, you're still seeing inflation very close to target. So there's no sense that inflation will-no sense in our models, or in our projections, or forecasts-that inflation will take off or move unexpectedly quickly from these levels, even if unemployment does remain low. So that's-that's what-so it's important to know that the-the unemployment rate forecasts go with the inflation forecasts and go with the rate forecasts. And so each person who's submitting them is submitting accommodate-you know, appropriate monetary policy that fits with that person's assessment. And their assessments generally are to support maximum employment and stable prices around 2 percent. So if we thought that inflation were going to take off, obviously, we'd be showing higher rates, but that's not what we think will happen. JEANNA SMIALEK. If I could just follow up really quickly. Then why, I guess, would the longer-run unemployment rate not be a little bit lower and closer to that 2020 number? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, it may be. It may be. We may find that out. You know, the best estimate that we have, over the longer run, is that. Although, you know, there's a range of views, you know. Some people are in the low 4s, and, again, I said the uncertainty bands are, you know, not quite a full percentage point on either side, but 3/4 of a percent, that kind of thing, so it's very possible. We have to be, you know-we can't do-we can't be too attached to these unobservable variables. You know, we-I think we have to be practical about the way we think about these things and we do that by being grounded in the data and what we see happening in the real economy. VICTORIA GUIDA. I have a couple of regulatory questions. First of all, on the countercyclical capital buffer, I was wondering, what are the chances that the Fed is going to need to use that in the next year or two? And then my second question is, there's been a lot of talk lately in Congress about the ability for banks to serve marijuana businesses, and I was wondering if you think that banks should be able to serve those businesses in states where marijuana is legal. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So the countercyclical capital buffer gives us the ability to raise capital requirements on the largest institutions when financial stability vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. That's the language that we've used. And that's certainly a possibility. I wouldn't say that-I wouldn't look at today's financial stability landscape and say that risks are meaningfully above normal. I would say that they're roughly at normal. You have-you know, households are well-you know, are in good shape. They're-they've paid down their debt, incomes are rising, people have jobs. So households are not really a concern. And banks are highly capitalized, so that's not really a concern. We see-there's some concern with asset prices in a couple of pockets. But overall, if you-if you bake it all in, I think we see, generally, financial vulnerabilities as moderate. Could that change, you asked, over a couple of years? Yeah, it could. You also asked about marijuana businesses. So this is a very difficult area because we have state law-many state laws permit the use of marijuana and federal law still doesn't. So it puts, you know, federally chartered banks in a very difficult situation. I think it would be great if that could be clarified. We don't have-you know, it puts the supervisor in a very, very difficult position. And, of course, this isn't our-our mandate has nothing to do with marijuana, so we don't really-we just would love to see it clarified, I think. JOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker. So since you-since even before you were Chairman of the Fed, when you were chair of the supervisory committee, you laid out a sort of regulatory revision agenda that's actually been pretty consistent. So there was the guidance on boards of governors, there was the-some changes to the stress tests, and-not changes to the stress test, but rather clarification on the modeling-and now, more recently, the changes to the enhanced supplemental leverage ratio. The Fed has also proposed some changes to the Volcker rule and, as I mentioned a minute ago, changes to the stress test with the stress capital buffer. Are these kind of the-are there any new frontiers of regulatory changes that you are envisioning or are you just-are you kind of done for the time being? Or what else can we expect from the Fed? CHAIRMAN POWELL. It's actually a pretty full docket right now. You mentioned a number of the things, but I would-I would point out-we're having, I guess, a public Board meeting tomorrow on the single counterparty credit limit provision. We've also got quite a lot of work to promulgate rules to-after S. 2155 that Senator Crapo's bill passed-we've got a lot of work to do under that. We've got to think about how we would reach below that $250 billion threshold to assess and supervise, regulate, you know, financial stability risks below that level. So what am I missing? There's-there-oh, oh, net stable funding ratio is out there to be done. So there's a lot of work to do, I think. You know, and if I can just take this opportunity to say, you know, the financial system all but failed 10 years ago. We went to work for 10 years to strengthen it-stronger capital, stronger liquidity, stress testing, resolution planning. We want to keep all that stuff. We want to make it, you know, even more effective and certainly more efficient. We want to tailor those regulations for institutions. We want the strongest provisions to apply to the most systemically important institutions. And so we're committed to preserving and enhancing that structure. But we-we're finding a lot that we can do in the way of tailoring regulations for the smaller, less systemically important institutions, and that's a lot of what we're working on right now. GREG ROBB. Thank you. You said at the beginning of your press conference that you plan to be more plainspoken. And so, okay, I wanted to know what you would say to workers who are worried that, you know, these paths of rate hikes that you've laid out will kind of undercut the wage growth they are just starting to see. Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would say that the economy is in great shape. If you look at household surveys, confidence is high. Look at businesses, confidence is high. If you ask-if you survey workers about the job market, they'll say that it's a really good environment to find jobs. If you survey businesses, they'll say that workers are scarce. So I think overall, we have-we have a really solid economy on our hands here. And so what we're doing is, we are trying to conduct monetary policy in a way that will sustain that expansion, keep the labor markets strong, and keep inflation above-right at-sorry, not above, but right at 2 percent. That's really what we're trying to do and, you know, I would say I like the results so far. We're-we've been very, very careful not to tighten too quickly. I think we've been patient. I think that patience has borne fruit and I think it continues to. We had a lot of encouragement to go much faster and I'm really glad we didn't. But, at this time, the-continuing on that gradual pace seems-continues to seem like the right thing. If we get a sense that the economy is reacting badly, then we'll certainly react to that. DAVID HARRISON. Hi, David Harrison with Dow Jones Newswires. Where do you see the neutral interest rate is right now? Do you think it's-do you see it sort of inching up because of the recent fiscal stimulus measures? And how will you know when we're getting close to that neutral point? So if-you know, if inflation stays around 2, it doesn't go above 2 for a while, do you see a need to actually exceed that neutral point? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I would just point you to the range of estimates at the Committee, which I think is 2 1/4 to 3 1/2, and the median is 2.9, right in there. So that's the range of estimates of the nominal neutral rate of interest. And we do understand that there's high uncertainty around the level, but that's kind of-so you can think of 2.9 as being-which is sort of a full percentage point away from where fed funds is going to trade after today's decision. You asked, is the-is the neutral rate moving up because of fiscal policy? Yes. I mean, there's-there should be an effect if you have increased deficits that should put upward pressure on, you know, a few tenths, let's say. Again, though, they were estimating these things. It's one of these unobserved variables so it's very hard to-we shouldn't try to speak about it with a-with a lot of precision or confidence. But, yes, that should put upward pressure on it. How will we know? Well, I think you have to look at inflation. You've got to look at-you've got to look at all of the indicators in the economy and look at inflation, look at unemployment, look at what's happening in the job market. And inflation is really important. It's worth noting that the last two business cycles didn't end with high inflation-they ended with financial instability-so that's something we need to also keep our eye on. VIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse. Have you talked during the meeting about when the Fed is going to remove or change the word ""accommodative"" that describe the monetary policy for almost 10 years? And could this change in the vocabulary make the market nervous? And have you thought already at some options so to know how you're going to call it down the road? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes, that is-that is something that we discuss. We look at all the language. As you know, we made a-we made a significant number of changes at this meeting. So language gets in the statement and then, you know, the economy changes. That's what happens. We really-our approach to policy hasn't changed. And, you know, as I mentioned earlier, for a long time, the economy has needed accommodative monetary policy. As the economy has recovered, we've been gradually raising rates and we will-we will be at a place relatively soon when, again, assuming we stay on this path, when interest rates will be in the zone of what FOMC participants think is roughly neutral. And, at that point, it would no longer be accurate for us to say that the Committee thinks that policy is accommodative. We know that's coming. We kind of don't think it's here yet, but it's certainly coming. And I think that the market will understand that. I mean, the real message is that you're getting close to the neutral rate. It's a characterization about where policy is. It's not a statement, really, that should upset the markets. But, you know, we'll obviously discuss it carefully in meetings and communicate about it. So. NAOATSU AOYAMA. Thank you very much. Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's newspaper. Would you expand on the-on your views on the downside risks-downside risks, especially in regard to trade issues? Many people are-in the key allies of the United States-are concerned that the United States may destabilize the underpinnings of the international liberal order the United States has created and built up in the postwar environment. So-and that will, of course, have a very negative economic implications for the global economy as well as the U.S. economy. So would you-have you-can I have your views on that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So, you know, as I mentioned earlier, I'm really committed to staying in our lane on things. We have very important jobs assigned to us by Congress and that's maximum employment, stable prices, financial stability. Trade is explicitly assigned to the executive branch by Congress and not to us. So we don't really-we don't really seek to play a role in trade policy. We're not at that table. Those are-those powers and decisions are given to others and so we want to stick to what we do. And, you know, I-as I mentioned earlier, we do hear from our business contacts, which are extensive in the United States, and we do report on that in the minutes, and I've just mentioned what those are. There is -there is concern that trade changes could be disruptive. And I also-as I also mentioned, we don't see it in the numbers yet. We really don't. We see a very strong economy across a bunch of fronts. It hasn't reached everyone, let's be clear on that. But most people who want a job can find one. We're well aware that there are pockets out there of people who have not felt the recession yet, but, broadly speaking, it's a good economy. STEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, Mr. Chairman, freelance journalist reporting for NPR. About financial conditions, which worries you more-warnings that rising short-term rates are bringing the yield curve closer to inversion, or the fact that long rates have risen very slowly and, in fact, are nearly 20 basis points below their recent high? How do you account for the fact that long rates have been so slow to rise? And what does it say about the inflation outlook as well? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So let me-let me briefly mention the yield curve. I mean, I-the yield curve is something that people are talking about a lot, including FOMC participants. And I-you have a range of views. It's something we're going to continue to be talking about. It's-but it's only one of many things, of course, that we talk about. I think that that discussion is really about what is appropriate policy, and how do we think about policy as we approach the neutral rate. How do we understand what the neutral rate is? How do we know where it is? And what are the consequences of being above or below it? That's really what-when people are talking about the slope of the yield curve, that's really what they're talking about. We know why-we know why the yield curve is flattening. It's because we're raising the federal funds rate. It makes all the sense in the world that the short end would come up. I think you asked-the harder question is, what's happening with long rates? And there are many things that move long rates around. Of course, there's an embedded expectation of the path of short rates. There's the term premium, which has been very low by historical standards. And so arguments are made that a flatter yield curve has less of a signal embedded in it. In addition, I think what you saw most recently that you referred to, Steve, was just risk-on, risk-off. In a risk-off environment, people want to own U.S. Treasuries, and you see-you know, Treasury prices go up, rates go down quite a lot. So-but I think ultimately, you know, what we're-what we really care about is what's the appropriate stance of policy. And there's a-there may be a signal in that long-term rate about what is the neutral rate, and I think that's why people are paying attention to the yield curve. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Companies are buying back their shares at a record rate. Corporate debt is up. Consumer debt is rising. Are we in a credit bubble? Is that something that you're worried about? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So if you look at households, you do not see excess credit growth, you don't see high levels of credit going out. So not so much households. And that really was where the problems were before the financial crisis, was particularly in-among household borrowing, particularly around mortgages. With-if you take banks, then, of course, their leverage is significantly lower. Or, to say it differently, their capital is significantly higher. If you ask about nonfinancial corporates, that's really where leverage is at levels that are high relative to history. But defaults are low, interest rates are low, you know, so it's something-that's something we're watching very carefully. But, again, I don't think we see it as-I think there are a range of views on that, but we are watching nonfinancial corporates. Households are in good shape, though, and that is-that is so important because that's where-you know, that's where we got into trouble before. And that's-it's often around property, and particularly housing, where you see real problems emerge. We don't really see that now, so we take some solace from that. MYLES UDLAND. Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance. Chair Powell, you referenced a minute ago this idea of cushion, or the fact that the Fed doesn't have as much of when rates are low and inflation is low. And I'm wondering if you or the Committee has thought about your move to raise interest rates as partly responding to the economy, but partly giving yourselves room to navigate in the inevitable future recession, whenever that was to come. And do you think that that has played any part in, you know, your outlook for policy or recent policy decisions? Or is it, you know, just a purely based on what the economy is doing? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it doesn't play any part in my thinking and I'll tell you why. If you raise rates too quickly, you're just increasing the likelihood of a recession, and that's exactly what you don't want to do. So the best thing you can do, I think-I think the incentives actually run in the other direction. If you're-if you're worried about going back to the lower bound, then risk management would suggest that you go a little slower in raising rates and tolerate-that's likely to be a more sustainable strategy to get further away from the zero lower bound. I think we're far enough away now, though, that the risks are kind of balanced. And so I think it's more just-we're just looking at the economy, and what does it need, and how do we-how do we sustain the expansion, keep the labor market strong, and try to keep inflation near 2 percent? MARK HAMRICK. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. You talked earlier about wage growth and your basic message to workers. How confident are you that when we do see stock buybacks and the like, the workers will get whatever your view of that share is as well and the wage hikes in the near term and in the foreseeable future? Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we don't-we don't have the tools to control that. If companies choose to-companies in our system are free to do what they can-what they need to do once they've-once they've made profits and have cash to distribute. They can distribute it to their shareholders, they can buy-either through dividends or through buybacks. They can pay their workers. You know, the part-and, you know, we don't play a role in those decisions. The part that we focus on is maximum employment. That's our mandate. So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it's not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat. And so I think we've been committed to that. I think we take that obligation very seriously. And, you know, over time, when-when labor markets are strong and companies are hiring, we should see higher wages. But, again, we don't really have the tools that will address the distribution of profits and that kind of thing."

"NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, given the lags of monetary policy, I want to know how you think about ending the tightening cycle? How will you know when to stop? And do you need to keep going until something in the economy breaks? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So the tightening cycle, as you know, is a reflection of the strength of the economy. And it's almost three years now that we've been gradually raising rates. And I think the fact that we have moved quite gradually, in a way, allows us to carefully watch incoming data in the real economy and in the financial markets to see how the economy is processing higher interest rates. And the fact that we're moving so gradually-I think it-I think it limits the long and variable lags problem because, you know, we're being able to raise rates and then wait and see how the economy absorbs these rate increases. And so far, the economy has performed very well and very much in keeping with our expectations. JIM PUZZANGHERA. Hi, Jim Puzzanghera from the L.A. Times. President Trump has stated publicly he's not thrilled with the interest rate hikes. His comments didn't appear to have any impact on you or your colleagues. Were his comments discussed at your meeting? And do you have any concerns about the effect of these types of comments on the perception of the Fed's independence and your monetary policy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we've been given a really important job to do on behalf of the American people by Congress, and we've been given the tools to do it, and my colleagues and I are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission. We consider the best thinking, the best theory, and the best evidence. We have disparate points of view, which we debate extensively and come to a perspective and try to set monetary policy to achieve maximum employment in a context of price stability. That's what we do. We don't consider political factors or things like that. And so that's who we are, that's what we do, and that's just the way it's always going to be for us. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can you explain how-the stock market being at a near all-time high, corporate spreads being very tight-how does the level of the market factor into your decisions to raise interest rates? Is there a concern on your part? And then, as sort of a second and related part, can you tell us what happens in 2020 and 2021 that-I know you can't tell us when you're shaking your head [laughter]-that prompts-that prompts you-the Fed to think that the rates need to still be above neutral in that time period? Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we-as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial-broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they're one of the many things that we take into account. The part of it that we control, though, is what we do with the federal funds rate and that has-that has effects out through, you know, out through the full interest rate curve and into financial asset prices generally. So the answer is, we take everything into account, but, you know, broader financial conditions are just one of the things that we take into account. In terms of '20 and '21, why-your question was why the funds rate needs to be above neutral? So you're right. Some of-some of the participants have mostly very modest overshoots of their personal estimates of neutral a couple-three years out. You know, it's far out into the future. I think it's hard to be confident that that's-that that's the way things are going to be. What we're going to be doing as we-as we go through time is asking at every meeting whether monetary policy is set to achieve our goals. And I think that that's an assessment of where policy will need to be some years down the road, and I'll leave it at that. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Chair Powell, I think-is this too good to be true? Because you've got four years here of unemployment below 4 percent-very low, substantially below NAIRU, what appears to be NAIRU-but no reaction of inflation there. And so I don't think that's ever happened since the 1960s. Why do you think it's going to happen now? Or in the alternative, is this forecast for unemployment just being driven by your confidence intervals to the extent that, well, we don't know what else to do, so just extend the lie out-line out until something happens? CHAIRMAN POWELL. No, you're right. The Committee forecasts what they-what they show, in general, is an economy where unemployment remains in the high and middle 3s throughout the entire forecast period and inflation remains very close to 2 percent. That is what the forecast shows. And that is based on our understanding of the way the inflation process works now and on the fact that the inflation seems to be fairly nonreactive to changes in slack-that is to say, a flat Phillips curve. And it's just-it's a-it's a world of strongly anchored inflation expectations. And that's not just our forecast, that's many forecasts. So that is-that is -that is the forecast. So you may ask-I mean, the sense is, what does the longer-run natural rate of unemployment mean? And so that really is a longer-run concept that we think the economy will return to over the longer run. But, obviously, that longer run, you know, isn't-it's not creating problems in the short run for that forecast. Now let's just admit that the inflation process has changed dramatically from where it was in the 1960s to where it is now. It's in a good place now. We can't take for granted that it will remain the way it is, and, you know, we will be, of course, watching carefully. If inflation reacts more strongly or more weakly to the strong economy, then we'll adjust policy appropriately. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, what are you buying with interest rates? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, interest rates, of course, have effects on growth, have effects-I mean if-I guess the-your question was, what are you buying with by raising interest rates? The question is, what would the economy look like if you didn't raise rates? It would look very different, I think, if we didn't raise rates. We're always trying to, you know, work our way between the-sort of the two-the two problems we face. One is that if we move too quickly, we can, you know, snuff out a recovery unnecessarily, and inflation falls short of its 2 percent target. Or if we move too slowly, we have an economy that can overheat. So we're-that-that's happened through history. We don't see any signs of that now, but we're always trying to navigate between those two shoals. And we think that gradually, you know, raising interest rates is the way that we kind of take both of those risks seriously. SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. The Fed has recently been saying that financial stability risks are moderate. What kind of developments could prompt a change in that assessment to elevated risks? And is there an argument for moving the countercyclical capital buffer, even when risks are moderate, rather than waiting until the risks are seen as elevated, which, arguably, could be too late? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I think one of the most important lessons from the financial crisis is really the importance of the stability of the financial system. And so we-since the financial crisis, as you're aware, we've had a major focus on building up our monitoring of financial conditions and financial stability issues. We've also put in place many, many initiatives to strengthen the financial system through higher capital and better regulation, more transparency, central clearing, margins on uncleared derivatives, all kinds of things like that, which are meant to strengthen the financial system. We've done many of those things, and we feel that the financial system is in a much better place. As we look at-as we look at conditions most recently-and this was at our last meeting, and it was in our minutes for the last meeting-quarterly, we have a briefing at the FOMC, and also at the Board, of the staffs' views on financial stability, and the staff judged the overall vulnerabilities to be moderate. If you dig into the different aspects of that question, households or balance sheets are in good shape. You know, employment is high, wages are rising, that sort of thing. The banking system, as I mentioned, is-you know, much higher capital, much higher liquidity-is much stronger. If you look at asset prices, it is true that some asset prices are in the upper range of their historical-upper reach of their historical ranges. And then if you look at nonfinancial corporates, you get-there is the story of leverage there. So it's not that there aren't any vulnerabilities, but we see them as moderate. Now, you ask about the countercyclical capital buffer. The countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that we added to our toolkit, I think, finally, back in 2016. We said that we would deploy it when vulnerabilities were meaningfully above normal. We revisit that on a regular schedule, and the last time we revisited it was, I think, last year-sometime last year-and concluded that the test was not met. As I mentioned at the last briefing, the-you know, the assessment was that vulnerabilities were moderate, but it remains a kit-a tool for our toolkit that we can deploy, you know, when and as we feel appropriate. SAM FLEMING. Has the chance of needing to deploy it increased? CHAIRMAN POWELL. As I said, I think I'm in the camp of seeing vulnerabilities as relatively moderate. I think the financial system-I think another thing that we learned in the crisis is that we need to be alert to the buildup of vulnerabilities as a long expansion continues. I don't see that in troubling-troubling amounts at this point, but, you know, I think it's appropriate for us to monitor that very carefully. MARTY CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, Associated Press. The researchers at the European Central Bank this week put out a paper saying that the impact of a trade war on the U.S. could be dire, that the U.S. economy could drop by 2 percent in the first year after a widespread trade war. Could you talk about the discussion you've had-your policy statement, does it mention the trade tensions? You did not mention them. What do you-what kind of outlook do you have right now for the trade war? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So I guess I need to start by saying that we're not responsible for trade policy, and we don't comment on particular, you know, trade actions and that sort of thing. But you will have seen that we have this very extensive network of business contacts around the country through the Reserve Banks largely, and we've been hearing a rising chorus of concerns from businesses all over the country about disruption of supply chains, materials costs and increases, and loss of markets, and things like that. So we've been hearing quite a lot of that, and we-the Reserve Bank presidents talk about it in the meeting, and it goes in the minutes. So we, you know, that's-we're very transparent about hearing all that. I think if you look at the aggregate perform-the performance of the U.S. economy at an aggregate-at a national level, it's hard to see much happening at this point. And-or you can look at it the other way: You can ask, if all of the tariffs that have been announced are applied, what would be the effect at the aggregate level? And they're still relatively small. You know, we worry about a couple of things. One is loss of business confidence, which could reduce investment. Again, we don't really see effects that we could measure yet. Also, the possibility of a financial market reaction over time to unexpected trade developments. More than anything, though, I would worry, in the longer run, where this is going, you know. If the-if the end place we get to is lower tariffs, that would be good, you know. Trade generally supports productivity, supports higher incomes. And, you know, fair trade-fair trade under internationally accepted rules can be a good thing. I think if this, perhaps inadvertently, goes to a place where we have widespread tariffs that remain in place for a long time-a more protectionist world-that's going to be bad for the United States' economy and for American workers, and families, and also for other economies. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. This is the third time this year that the FOMC has raised its growth forecasts. I'm wondering if you could share a little bit about what's causing that rise and whether you see supply-side effects coming through from the fiscal policy-fiscal stimulus yet. Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it's true. This year has-we've kept raising our forecast for this year. This-as the year's gone on, the economy has come in stronger than we expected, and that's a really good thing. And the economy, as I mentioned at the beginning, is strong, and there's good reason to expect that to continue. You ask why. You know, some of it is, no doubt, the effect of the fiscal policy changes, the tax cuts, and the spending increases-that's got to be part of the story. Part of it may be higher oil prices, which are calling for more investment in the oil patch. But, you know, the growth picture is very much supported by very high readings of household confidence, business confidence, so it's a-it's a-it's a-it's a pretty particularly bright moment, I think. If you look back over the last decade, this is a pretty good moment for the U.S. economy. HEATHER LONG. And the supply-side effects? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, supply-side effects, yeah. So, you know, we hope they're huge, frankly. You know, the idea is, you cut-you reduce taxation on corporations and particularly-and allow faster expensing for investment. The idea is to encourage more investment, and that is one of the things that drives productivity, which is one of the main things that drives rising incomes. So the effects are very uncertain, they're-you know, they're-the literature is-it's-there's no clear answer to exactly how these mechanisms work or how effective they are. And it would be soon to be seeing supply-side effects. The other-supply-side effects are probably both more uncertain and they're probably slower to come in. But, you know, as I said, we-I certainly hope-I hope that we'll be marking up our estimates of potential growth as well. CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. Taking a page from your risk-management approach in Jackson Hole, Mr. Chairman, I'm wondering if you can talk about what risks would make the Committee-plausible risks-go faster in 2019. What risks would make them go slower? If you could talk about scenarios. And then I'd like to ask, do you see yourself, as this stimulus tails off, which it does in the forecast, possibly cutting rates to soft-land the economy? I know the forecast doesn't show that, but I'm curious how you soft-land without doing that. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so I think I mentioned in the opening remarks maybe something that addressed your question about what would make us go faster and slower. You know, the main thing where we might need to move along a little bit quicker would be if inflation-inflation surprises to the upside. We don't see that. We really don't see that. It's not in our forecast, but any-so I would-I regard that as a risk. I think either a significant significant correction and lasting correction in financial markets or a slowing down in the economy that's inconsistent with our forecast-those are the kinds of things we'd react to. In terms of what, you know, what we would do-you know, I think we're always going to be adjusting monetary policy to-in light of conditions on the ground. So if the economy is weakening, then it's very possible we'd be-we'd be cutting rates and, you know, vice versa. And so I can't rule that out. It-I think it's quite difficult, though, to know what the effects-what the sort of end effects of fiscal policy are going to be in 2020. It's difficult to know what the policy will be, let alone what their effects will be that far out. So we have to make estimates, but we know that they're highly uncertain. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you, Chairman. The unemployment rate is now at 3.9 percent. The average hourly wages rose 2.9 percent for the past 12 months. Inflation, according to your numbers, holding steady. The amount of job vacancies that we have out there and the number of people coming back into the workforce this year-where is the point at which, then, we are actually above the natural rate of unemployment and the Federal Reserve should reexamine the consistency of the rate hikes going forward so not to cool an expanding economy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You mean-you mean, where's the point at which inflation-unemployment is too low? Yeah. Yeah. You know, so we've been-I think the perform-labor force participation has surprised us on the upside. There is a long-run trend there, and we've now had basically five flat years. If you look-if you look at labor force participation, since the fourth quarter of '13 till now, you really have a-kind of an oscillation that basically is a sideways movement in the face of a significant downward trend, thanks to aging and other factors. That's a gain of well more than a percentage point in participation, so that's really-that's really a good thing. Those are people who are remaining in contact with the labor force and looking for jobs, finding jobs. So that's a great thing. And, by the way, it's a signal. It's one of the things that has allowed the unemployment rate not to fall further. And it's a-it's a signal, too, that there may be more there on the supply side, that there may be more labor supply than the prior trend would indicate. So it's a very positive thing to see people staying in the labor force. And, you know, we don't know how long it can continue. We have models, and we look at this-we look at this question all the time. And, you know, admittedly, we've been surprised on the positive side here, so we're open to the idea that that may continue or not. DONNA BORAK. Hi, Chair. Donna Borak with CNN. Just to follow up on the tariff question, you said earlier that it seems as the effects of the tariff so far haven't quite materialized-those weren't your words verbat[im]-but Wal-Mart, Gap, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Macy's have all said that they expect the tariffs to affect the prices of everyday consumer goods. So my question is, when-should there be an effect-when would you expect to see that? And at what point do you start to become worried that it's actually going to affect consumer spending and dampening economic growth? CHAIRMAN POWELL. It's a concern. It's a risk. You know, so you could see prices moving up. You don't see it yet, but we-you could see retail prices moving up. The tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where they've been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices, where raising prices is really difficult, you know, with the ability to shop on the internet. This could provide, you know, a way for-again, we don't see it in the numbers. And, you know, until we see it in the numbers, it's hard to say how one would react. And the other question would be, if you're just talking about the effect on inflation is, is it just a one-time increase in the price level, or is it actually fueling higher inflation going forward? And that's a real-that's an important question in, in how we would think about the appropriate response. DONNA BORAK. But is there a sense of timing, in terms of when you might see that kick in, the effect of? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Don't see it yet. You know, don't see it yet, but we-you're hearing-I mean, broadly across the economy, it's not just tariffs. You're hearing-we're hearing a lot of talk of labor shortages, of material costs in particular industries. We're hearing a lot, you know, what amount to supply-side constraints and things like that, but we're not seeing it. We're seeing a sort of modest increase in wages, inflation right around 2 percent, no sense of it moving up really, so we're not seeing it yet. And, you know, we just aren't, and we're watching very carefully. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, Michael McKee, Bloomberg Radio and Television. Financial conditions are still extremely loose by all the measures that track that. The flow of funds shows the decline in short-term borrowing other than in Treasuries. So I'm wondering if that suggests a change in the way that tightening affects the economy. And along those lines, you mentioned that you dropped the word ""accommodative"" doesn't suggest a change in policy. But if you're dropping forward guidance in terms of ""accommodative,"" does the dot plot really serve any purpose anymore if, as you say, you can't be confident out to 2021 what's going to happen with the economy? CHAIRMAN POWELL. A couple questions in there. So the dot plot-I mean, I-it's not new. I don't think it's a new point that forecasts two and three out-two or three years out are fairly uncertain. The dot plot is individual FOMC participants who are writing down their individual views on the evolution of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy. We don't vote on that. These are individual forecasts. I think market participants generally find that interesting information, and so it seems to me to be serving a purpose. I think the point with ""accommodative"" was that its useful life was over. You know, we put that in the statement in 2015, just when we lifted off, and the idea was to provide assurance that we weren't trying to slow down the economy, but, in fact, we were still-interest rates were still going to be pushing to support economic activity. Well, that-you know, that purpose has been well served, and the language now doesn't really say anything that's important to the way the Committee is thinking about policy going forward. That's why that came out. Did I get-did I get all of your ques-? MICHAEL MCKEE. The idea that financial conditions remain loose even though you raised rates 200 basis points? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, you know, it's-if you look at a broad financial conditions index, that's pretty much the answer you'll get. We don't control that, and, as I mentioned earlier, we do take financial conditions into account in what we do. And financial conditions are affecting the broader economy, so, by definition, we're taking them into account. But if you look at-look at interest rates, you know, interest rates-look at long-term interest rates this year and short-term interest rates this year, there's very significant increases. And, you know, with your long and variable lags, that should be-that should be having an effect over time. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. So Nellie Liang was just put forward by President Donald Trump to the Fed Board, and I was just curious, you know, given that she's a longtime veteran of the Fed, whether you could speak to what role you played in, you know, recommending candidates to the President, giving input on who he should nominate. And then also, if I-if I may follow up on the financial stability discussion from earlier, you know, you've mentioned before that corporate debt is at high levels, and I was curious whether, you know, you have any qualms about loosening up restrictions on leveraged lending by making that guidance less of a-less of a cudgel, I guess, while-at a time when leveraged lending is gaining steam? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so in terms of nominations to the Fed, those are entirely, completely under the control of the White House and, ultimately, the President. And traditionally, the Fed Chair has been consulted on those, and I'm happy to say that that has continued. But these are-these are really decisions for the White House, and, you know, we are-think of us as just being consulted. I will say that I'm very happy and excited about the team that we're putting together, and I'm very much looking forward to having those offices up and down our hall filled. It's been pretty quiet, more quieter than usual, which is saying something on the Board hall. So we're looking forward to getting some people confirmed. In terms of corporate debt, so this is a-this is a-you know, I was an investor for a long time in areas that were very close to the leveraged lending markets. So, you know, I have had a lot of experience in that. That market has evolved really significantly since before the crisis. And, you know, the banks take much less risk than they used to. They're-the-they're essentially in the business of distributing these loans and bonds rather than keeping them on their balance sheet, to a much greater degree. But it's also true-and there's significant research on this-that excessive risk-taking in the leveraged lending markets does have channels for affecting the real economy, if there's overheating and that kind of thing in those markets, so we monitor that carefully. You know, the guidance is-isn't binding, as you pointed out, that the leveraged lending isn't binding, and that's just-that's just the way that the law is interpreted. So it's something we're monitoring, and, as I mentioned, we think overall vulnerabilities are moderate. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. If I could come back to ""accommodative,"" do you think of policy as accommodative at present? How close are you to neutrality, and do you share the view of some of your colleagues that you'll eventually need to be restrictive? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay, so are we accommodative now? So I think if you look at the-look at the dot plot in the SEP, you'll see that the federal funds rate, even after today's move, is below the longer-run neutral estimate of every single participant that-who submits a-an estimate of that. So that's why this is the perfect time to take the language out, because, you know, it's perfectly clear that there can't be a signal because, you know, by definition, that means an accommodative policy. So it wasn't because policy is not accommodative. It is still accommodative. The thinking was more, as I mentioned, it's more that the language has run its useful life. There's another point, though, too, which is, you know, we don't want to suggest either that we have this precise understanding of where ""accommodative"" stops or suggest that that's a really important point in our thinking. You know, what we're going to be doing, assuming we stay on this path, is, we're going to be carefully monitoring incoming data from the financial markets and from the economy and asking ourselves whether our policy is achieving the goals we want to achieve-you know, sustain the economy, maximum employment, stable prices. That's the way we're thinking about it, and that does kind of amount to thinking less about one's precise point estimate of the neutral rate. So that's how I think about that. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. The second question was, do you think you're going to end up in a restrictive posture? Governor Brainard, for example, has said that she expects that you will need to do that. Do you agree with that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. It's possible. It's very possible. It happens often. And, as I mentioned, many of the participants have written that down, and they've written down really modest overshoots, you know, amounting to one rate hike kind of thing, which wouldn't have a big effect on the economy. You know, it-I would just say, you know, it really depends on what happens. It depends on if we keep going-you can think of it different ways. Maybe we've underestimated the neutral rate. Maybe we'll be raising our estimate of the neutral rate and we'll just go to that, or maybe we'll keep our neutral rate here and then go one or two rate increases beyond it. I think it's very possible, but I mean, ultimately, isn't really the question we're answering. The question we're answering is, how do we provide the economy just the right amount of support-not too much, not too little-to sustain the recovery and achieve our statutory goals? GREG ROBB. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. The 10-year anniversary of the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers got a lot of attention over the last month. I was wondering if you thought there were any lessons from the crisis that you want to share-and two points on that. You go to Congress a lot and talk to members of Congress. Now, Secretary Paulson and Mr. Geithner and Chair Bernanke have said that Congress made a mistake when it took away the Fed's emergency powers in Dodd-Frank. And then one other thing is that, are you confident that all these nonbanks didn't-you know, nonbanks never got put into the, you know, the FSOC, you know, system. So are you confident that the-you can see the risks in the financial system? Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, three things there. The first thing is the single biggest thing I think that we learned was the-as I mentioned, I think, earlier, the importance of maintaining the stability of the financial system. So I think if you look-if you look back at the way the models worked and the way people thought about risk in the economy, that's what was missing, and I think it's not missing anymore. So we-you know, we put a tremendous focus on that. We raised capital, liquidity. We have stress tests, which force banks to understand-the largest banks particularly-to understand and better manage their risk and have enough capital to survive a really substantial shock that's at least as bad as the financial crisis. And if all that doesn't work, we've got resolution plans, which we've, you know, through many cycles, have made really substantial progress, more than I had thought was likely. So we've done a lot. Nobody's-you know, nobody is, I think, overconfident that we've solved every problem. And, you know, now we're going back and kind of taking a hard look at everything and, you know, trying to make-trying to-trying to keep at it. So I think those are the really important lessons, and, you know, we-we're determined not to, you know, not to forget them. And that's, I think, a risk now-is to-is to forget things that we-that we learned. That's just human nature over time. I saw the article you're talking about; the question is, did Congress take things away, emergency powers from the Fed? So there was sort of a trade for taking away our power under 13, section 13(3), to provide support to individual nonbanks, which is really holding companies and other companies. In exchange for that, we got orderly liquidation authority and a resolution authority. Was it a mistake? I don't think there's any sense that Congress would seriously look at changing that. I have real doubts about whether it was wise to take away our crisis-fighting tools. I think you put them away, and you hope you never need them, but-and I certainly strongly oppose efforts to take away more of our tools. You know, the third thing you mentioned is the designation power. So it's a really important power. In my mind, it should be used-my thinking, it should be used sparingly, and that means, you know, in situations where you have-I mean, in principle, you could have another Lehman Brothers come up out of the ground that's not a bank, and it could be very threatening-or it could be capable of creating systemic risk. And so I think it's a critical power to have. But, again, I would use it-I would tend to use it fairly sparingly. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Are you worried about the effect of rising interest rates on consumers? Credit card rates have jumped to more than 17 percent since the Fed started raising interest rates. Mortgage rates are up. What do you say to consumers? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, we look-of course, we look at that very carefully, and interest rates are going up across a broad range of consumer borrowing, as they would when we raise short-term interest rates. They're still quite low by historical levels. And the other thing I'll say is, take-if you take housing, if you look at the NAR Affordability Index, housing is still more affordable now than it was before the financial crisis. So you're right that the cost of borrowing is going up, but it's going up from what were extraordinarily low levels, and it is something that we watch carefully. You know, the effect on consumer spending is a very important channel through which interest rates work, and so we do monitor the effects. HANNAH LANG. Hi, Hannah Lang, American Banker. OCC's decision to go at CRA alone suggests that there's some sort of disagreement among how to proceed with a joint plan. What are the issues that are preventing a joint plan from developing, and how close are you to a possible joint plan? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, at the Fed, we are, you know, deeply committed to the mission of CRA, which is for banks to provide credit and other banking services in the communities they serve. And we have also been of the view for some time that with the evolution of technology particularly and changes-changes in the nature of banking, that it's an appropriate time-it's past an appropriate time, but now it's certainly an appropriate time to revisit the way we think about CRA. But we don't want to lose that focus on community, and, you know, we definitely want to see that fundamental purpose of the law sustained. Many of the issues that we had were reflected in the OCC's ANPR, and we're-we're hopeful that, over time, there will be a joint proposed rulemaking with the OCC, the FDIC, and the Fed. It's a process, and, you know, we're very much interested in continuing to push it forward. STEVE BECKNER. Steve Beckner, freelance journalist filing for NPR. Mr. Chairman, following up on the neutral rate issue-and you touched on this-but, you know, you and your colleagues slightly lifted the longer-run estimate, the neutral funds rate estimate to 3 percent, but that's still, I believe, like 125 basis points below where it was six years ago. What are the odds that productivity, you know, investment, productivity, labor market, other developments could further push up the longer-run estimate and possibly make the projected funds rate levels less restrictive than they now seem? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, in principle, the-these starred variables-the long-run growth rate of the economy, the neutral rate of interest, the natural rate of unemployment-don't move quickly. They move very gradually. They're pinned down by longer-run forces, like demographics. In the case of the funds rate, it's more-it's productivity-it's appetite for safe assets and demographics and other things, too. So they move quite slowly through time. I think we all look at them-those of us who file SEPs every quarter will look at that every quarter and not make a change every quarter but, every now and again, make a change. And you're right-we actually-the median ticked up a tenth. It's a tenth we're talking about here, so-but still, I think it's a positive thing that people could be raising their estimates of the longer-run neutral rate and potentially the longer-run growth rate. Who knows? And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend. It's just that you change those estimates over time. They're informed by incoming data. They don't change a lot, though, although they did-it's interesting that the neutral rate changed quite sharply after the financial crisis in many different models, and it's been slow to recover. I don't expect a dramatic recovery there, but, you know, we-we're so bad at forecasting productivity. It's just very hard to know when productivity is going to arrive and in what quantity. So I think we have to be humble about how little we really know about where these starred value variables either are or are going. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thank you for taking the question. I'd like to just kind of ask again-you mentioned earlier that gradual-a gradual pace of rate increases will make it easier to react. But, specifically, what are you going to be looking to see, because you've also mentioned, you know, that monetary policy operates with a lag, so any kind of specific signposts that maybe we've reached the end of the tightening cycle or where we should stop? Secondly, if you worry about the divergence between interest rates in the U.S. and internationally, especially at a time when emerging markets are under pressure. Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. So, you know, some of the things that we'd be looking at to tell us whether we're getting close to supply-side limits would be, first, does job growth slow down? A slowing down in job growth would be an indicator, you know. An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you're reaching those points. You know, if headline growth slowed down, that's another one. So all of those things would be worth taking into consideration. I think also, though, we've seen sometimes sharp tightening in financial conditions, as we saw at the beginning of 2016, can have a substantial effect pretty quickly on our economy if it's a broad and significant tightening. So we would be looking for those kinds of things and many other things. So, in terms of divergence, yes. So the U.S. economy is, as I mentioned, is strong and is at a pretty positive moment, you know, with strong growth, healthy labor market, inflation right on target, as I mentioned. So-and we've seen growth abroad, but growth, I think, both in advanced economies and in some emerging economies has slowed down a little bit. And in that world, you know, if the U.S. is stronger, then that's just part of the context, part of the environment that could mean a higher dollar. It could be-it could therefore mean that some of our demand will wind up being shared with other economies. That's the way the integrated international economy works. So you could see that, and, you know, it's just-it's just all of the-all things that go into thinking about, you know, the path of the economy. I would say, you know, we're not responsible for the dollar. Of course, the Treasury is responsible for managing the dollar, but the dollar has only partly recovered the decline that it had in 2017. It's moved up off its lows, but it's not as high as it was at the beginning of last year yet by a significant margin. JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with Market News International. Can you give us an update on the technical adjustment in implementing monetary policy that the Fed made earlier this year when it decoupled the interest on excess reserves rate from the upper bound of the target range? And have you been happy with that adjustment? And do you see the need to make another such adjustment in the near future? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we've said that we would use our tools to assure that the federal funds rate trains-trades within the target range. And the principal tools we use have been interest on excess reserves and then, at the bottom end, a reverse repo facility. So we-in June, when we raised rates, we only raised the interest on excess reserves by 20 basis points and raised the range by 25, and that moved federal funds sort of back into the range. It worked, and it was successful. The federal funds rate traded in the low 190s, well within the range. We may-we may do that again. You know, we-again, we have our tools, and we will use them. We think it's principally a function just of a number of things, but particularly high Treasury supply, and-which is showing up in repo rates and then showing up in fed funds as well. So we don't see it as a-as a big problem. We see it as a problem we can address with our tools, and we'll use them if we have to. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Last month, the CEA outlined a different way to calculate wage growth. Has the Fed looked at that at all, and what are you seeing in terms of nonwage-based compensation? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I wouldn't comment on a CEA paper, and I would imagine they probably wouldn't comment on our stuff, either, but I would just say this. So I am familiar with the question and the work. You know, we look-we look at a range of indicators of wages, and I think the broader, the better. You really-in a perfect-a perfect wage measure would also include benefits, because a lot of compensation these days shows up in the form of benefits rather than wages, so I think it's right to choose those broader ones. But they're kind of all telling the same story right now. If you look at the principal four that we look at-we look at a whole range of wage and benefit cost indicators-they are all now showing wages and benefits around 3 percent growth, right? Clustered around 3 percent. That's a full percentage point higher than it was five years ago. That's a good thing. Then the question-the other question is, what about inflation? You know, if you're-if you're looking for real wage increases, you've got to ask inflation, and there, you have to pick an inflation measure. Some people pick CPI. We, of course, pick personal consumption expenditures because we think it's a little better measure. It's a little broader, and it tends to run a little bit lower as well, but that's not why we pick it. We just think it's more accurate. And that-the trend there is running around 2 percent, so if wages are running at rough-wages and benefits running at roughly 3 percent and inflation running at around 2 percent. PCE headline inflation is at 2.3 percent. PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent. So we think of that as 2 percent. That's how we think about it. Is that-I hope that helps. MYLES UDLAND. Myles Udland, Yahoo Finance. Chair Powell, I want to follow up on something you said, actually, at Jackson Hole. You were talking about longer-term structural challenges for the economy, and you mentioned that addressing the federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires. I'm just wondering if you could, you know, maybe expand on your thoughts there and if this is an issue that comes up among members of the FOMC at all. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So it doesn't really come up. It's not really our job. And we do-we do monetary policy. We regulate financial institutions, financial stability, that sort of thing. We don't have responsibility for fiscal policy. But in the longer-run, fiscal policy will have a significant effect on the economy, so for that reason, I think my predecessors have commented on fiscal policy. But they've commented on-at a high level rather than trying to get involved in particular, you know, particular measures. And so-and I-my plan is to kind of stick to the same approach and stay in our lane. And, you know-so I would just say, it's-it's no secret, it's been true for a long time that with our uniquely expensive health-care delivery system and the aging of our population, we've been on an unsustainable fiscal path for a long time, and there's no hiding from it. In the end, we will have to face that, and I think, you know, the sooner, the better. And also, these are good times. These are, you know, this is-this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range-in the neighborhood of full employment. Interest rates are low. It's a-it's a good time to be addressing these things. So I just-I put that out there and leave it at that. TAKESHI KAWANAMI. I'm Takeshi Kawanami from Nikkei newspaper. Thank you for taking my question. I'd like to ask about emerging markets. What do you think about impact of U.S. monetary policy on emerging markets-interest rate, currency depreciation, or capital outflow from emerging countries? And do you think there is a possibility to stop the interest rate hike due to emerging markets turmoil-due to turmoil in emerging markets? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sorry, the second question was? TAKESHI KAWANAMI. There is a possibility to stop the . . . CHAIRMAN POWELL. Oh, to stop. TAKESHI KAWANAMI. . . . hike. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we serve a domestic mandate, which is assigned to us by Congress, and that is to have maximum employment and stable prices. About half of global GDP is outside the United States, and way more than half of the growth is outside the United States and in emerging markets, I should say. And so the performance in the emerging market economies really, really matters to us in carrying out our domestic mandate. I'd also say that, you know, a strong U.S. economy, where Americans are buying things and the economy is growing and our-you know, that's going to support demand all around the globe, so that's a good thing. Now, we do understand, though, that when we-when our economy is strong and we're raising rates, that puts upward pressure on interest rates around the world and can affect countries, particularly countries that have significant external dollar borrowing. And what we try to do is be very transparent about what we're doing and why. And we have been, I believe, and we've also moved quite gradually. So I-you know, I think we've been performing well on that front. There are some countries that are-that are undergoing severe stress, a handful of them, and-but not most emerging market countries. It's a relatively small number, and those particular countries have, you know, have particular vulnerabilities, which are well known in the form of budget deficits, and significant external dollar borrowings, and high inflation, and things like that. So, again, we'll continue to conduct U.S. monetary policy as transparently as we possibly can, and that's really the best thing we can do, along with supporting U.S. growth. I'll just-I think that answers both your questions, actually. VIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse. You mentioned earlier a possible, not probable, correction, and I want to come back to the high level of the stock market. Are there any participants to the FOMC to think that we are witnessing an episode of irrational exuberance or rational exuberance? And if there was a steep correction, would it provoke financial stability concerns? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So I don't comment on the appropriateness of the level of stock prices. I can say that by some valuation measures, they're in the upper range of their historical value ranges. But, you know, I wouldn't want to-I wouldn't want to speculate about what the consequences of a market correction should be. You know, we would-we would look very carefully at the nature of it, and I mean, it-really-really what hurts is if consumers are borrowing heavily and doing so against, for example, an asset that can fall in value. So that's a really serious matter when you have a housing bubble and highly levered consumers and housing values fall. And we know that that's a really bad situation. A simple drop in equity prices is-all by itself, doesn't really have those features. It could certainly feature-it could certainly affect consumption and have a negative effect on the economy, though. MARK HAMRICK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mark Hamrick with Bankrate.com. One thing that's changed since the crisis is, the majority of mortgages issued last year came from so-called nonbank lenders, as traditional banks scaled back. What confidence do you have about supervision and, I suppose, also regulation in this space given the role of housing finance in the crisis? Thank you. CHAIRMAN POWELL. It's a good question. So you're right that a lot of mortgages are now originated outside the system. Many of those, though, have to meet certain basic standards to be bought by the GSEs. I think we-if we look at mortgage credit more broadly, though, what we see is that credit is pretty widely available to people with high scores and with good credit-good credit records, and much, much less available than it was before the crisis to people with low scores and perhaps troubled credit history. You know, it's-have we-have we set-have we got that exactly right? I don't know. I mean, I-but that's clearly-that's the reality. In terms of those institutions, they do have supervision by the CFPB and other state regulators. But you're right. They're much-much of the origination process has moved outside the banking system, and it's something we monitor. September 26, 2018 Chairman Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 1 of 5"

"SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. One of the recent surprises has been fairly tepid inflation data. I wonder, first of all, if you could explain why you think, despite the extremely tight labor market, we're still not seeing much in the way of inflationary pressures. And in the context of a more data-dependent Fed, how will the Fed respond to further undershoots of inflation moving into next year? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, you're right, Sam. Inflation has come in just a touch below where we expected it to be-not by a big amount, but by a small amount. More broadly, 2018 has been the strongest year since the recov-since the financial crisis. And during that period we've had low unemployment and strong growth, and inflation has still remained just a touch below 2 percent. So I do think that gives the Committee the ability to be patient in moving forward. As I mentioned, there's significant uncertainty about the-both the path and the ultimate destination of any further rate increases. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. Today, the Fed lowered its expectations for interest rate increases. Given that, I'm wondering if the Fed has had any discussion of altering the course of balance sheet normalization and if you could give us any insight on what might lead the FOMC to alter that balance sheet normalization in 2019. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sure. If you go back some years, I think we-people who were working at the Fed in 2013 and '14 took away the lesson that the markets could be very sensitive to news about the size of the balance sheet, the pace of asset purchases, the pace of runoff, and things like that. So we thought carefully about this, on how to normalize policy, and came to the view that we would effectively have the balance sheet runoff on automatic pilot and use monetary policy, rate policy, to adjust to incoming data. And I think that has been a good decision. I think that the runoff of the balance sheet has been smooth and has served its purpose. And I don't see us changing that. And I do think that we will continue to use monetary policy, which is to say rate policy, as the active tool of monetary policy. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chairman Powell, you talked a little bit earlier about the ability to be patient. And so as you think about your next policy moves, are you inclined to go at the current recent pace to a slightly different destination that's laid out in the projections today? Or does the current environment of restrained inflation maybe allow you to space out your next few moves and take more time to get there? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as background, I would just point to 2018 being a very strong year and the Committee looking forward to 2019 and still having what amounts to a positive forecast. We still are forecasting, individually, growth a bit above its longer-run potential-2.3 percent is what we're forecasting. We're forecasting that growth will be strong enough that unemployment will drop still further and inflation will remain right near our target. So I'd say that's a reasonably positive forecast. Going forward, you know, I will be looking, in particular, to see whether incoming data tell us that we're, in fact, on that path, that development of the economy is in line with that expectation. That will be the main thing. More broadly, though, I think we've reached the bottom end of the range of Committee estimates of what might be neutral. I think, from this point forward, we're going to be letting the data speak to us and form the outlook and inform our understanding of what would be appropriate policy. So there's a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the ultimate destination of any further increases. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC. Could you tell us how three things affected the outlook for the economy and rates? The first is how the market's decline affected the outlook for the economy and for rates. The second is trade tensions and the tariff, or how you factor that into your outlook. And the third is comments by the President urging you not to hike rates. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, as I mentioned, we monitor a broad range of economic conditions, including financial conditions-a broad range of financial conditions. And we took on board the tightening in financial conditions, which-not any one condition, but, broadly speaking, financial conditions have tightened since the September meeting, really. So we took that on board in our forecast. That's why the forecast for growth and inflation went down a little bit. But, remember, that's in a context of a more accommodative path. So we also took down our rate forecast. So we definitely did take that into account, and, as you can see from the statement language, we acknowledged those risks in the clause about monitoring developments. And we're going to be watching carefully to see as those things develop. I think, more broadly, there's been a sense of concern among business people and market people about global growth, and, you know, that may be partly about trade tensions, it may be partly about a variety of things. If you just mechanically drop into a model of the U.S. economy tariffs, you don't see very large effects. The large effects would have to come from financial market changes or from losses in business confidence. And those are things that are very difficult to model. On your third factor, you know, political considerations have played no role whatsoever in our discussions or decisions about monetary policy. We're always going to be focused on the mission that Congress has given us. We have the tools to carry it about. We have the independence, which we think is essential to be able to do our jobs in a nonpolitical way. And you know, we are-we at the Fed are absolutely committed to that mission, and nothing will deter us from doing what we think is the right thing to do. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, the New York Times. You're about to undershoot your inflation target for the seventh straight year. Your new forecasts say that you're going to undershoot it for the eighth straight year. Should we interpret the dot plot as suggesting that some members of your Committee believe that policy should be in a restrictive range by the end of next year? If so, can you help us to understand why people would be advocating restrictive monetary policy at a time of persistent inflation undershoots? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, we-as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots. And you're right, inflation has continued to surprise to the downside-not by a lot, though. I think we're very close to 2 percent, and, you know, we do believe it's a symmetric goal for us. Inflation is symmetric around 2 percent, and that's how we're going to look at it. We're not trying to be under 2 percent. We're trying to be symmetrically around 2 percent. And I don't-you know, I've never said that I feel like we've achieved that goal yet. The only way to achieve inflation symmetrically around 2 percent is to have inflation symmetrically around 2 percent, and we've been close to that but we haven't gotten there yet, and we have not declared victory on that. So that remains to be accomplished. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Jeanna Smialek, Bloomberg News. Just following up on Binya's question-I guess if you haven't achieved 2 percent inflation and you don't see an overshoot, which would be sort of implied by a symmetrical target, what's the point in raising rates again at all? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, again, I go back to the health of the economy. If you look at 2018, as I mentioned, this the best year since the financial crisis. You've had growth well above trend. You've got unemployment dropping. You've got inflation moving up to 2 percent. And we also have a positive forecast, as I mentioned, and, in that context, we think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy. Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative. It can move to neutral. It seems appropriate that it be neutral. We're now at the bottom end of the range of estimates of neutral. So that's the basis upon which we made the decision. I also think we took on board, you know, the risks to that, and, you know, we're certainly cognizant of them. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You've established for this coming year a communications panel to look at how the Fed communicates. Could you talk a little bit about what you expect to get from that panel, and will the dot plot be involved in that at all? How do you think the dot plot is working? Are we dealing with it the way that you want us to be handling the dot plot, or is it something that you might tweak a bit? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So this review, what it really is-it's coming at a time when the economy is strong, and it's a good time to take a step back, we think, and ask whether our strategy and our tools and our communications around monetary policy are doing the job that Congress has assigned us to do on behalf of the American people. And what we're going to do is, we're going to open ourselves up and have a discussion with many outside groups of all different parts of the economy, including, you know, an academic conference in June in Chicago. And, again, the idea is to, you know, listen to new ideas, better ideas, old ideas-many of them have been around-and try to assess whether there are better ways we can do things. One of the overarching facts is that rates have been really coming down overall for more than three decades now. We may be in a world where interest rates are just lower for the time being, and, therefore, we'll have less policy space to react to economic downturns. And we'd want to be evaluating ideas for-again, for better achieving the goals that Congress has given us. We're not looking at law changes at all, and we're not looking at changing the inflation target, for example. We are looking for better ways to achieve the inflation goal-for example, on a symmetric basis. So that's the sense of that. As I mentioned, on the dot plot-you asked about the dot plot. I think the dot plot generally does provide useful information about the reaction function of Committee participants-sometimes more useful than others, I'll admit. But, in general, I think people sort of have it figured out and understand what it is and what it isn't. But that doesn't mean we don't like to repeat what it isn't, which-it's not a consensus forecast. It's not something that we vote on. It's something that each of us writes down, and we always update it as-you know, as data come in and as we update our outlooks. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. The balance sheet reduction-how much additional tightening do you think has come from that? We know in the markets that the cost of credit rising, commercial paper, repo rates, the TED spread widening-do you see any concerns about the availability or the price of credit that could slow the markets? And if, in 2019, we see the economy start to slow, would you, if you don't adjust the balance sheet, be risking too much tightening? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we do watch all of that, but the amount of-the amount of runoff that we've had so far is pretty small. And if you just run the quantitative easing models in reverse, you would get a pretty small adjustment in economic growth and real outcomes. So we don't think, you know, things that are happening at the short run-at the short end-are driven by many other factors other than the balance sheet runoff. For example, just-very large bill supply has pushed up short-term rates, has pushed up repo rates. Tightening of the federal funds rate has raised short-term borrowing costs. So, you know, we're alert to these issues. We're watching them carefully. But we don't see, you know, the balance sheet runoff as creating significant problems. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Hi, Edward Lawrence, Fox Business Network. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We've seen enormous volatility in the markets recently. We know the President said, you know, don't raise interest rates. It's well documented. The National Association of Realtors' chief economist says that it's starting to affect first-time homebuyers with the mortgage rates going up. When do you think these pauses need to come in next year? Do we need to keep this, as you say, gradual? And then, in addition, what data are you specifically looking at for you that shows when the Federal Reserve starts to become that headwind in the economy with the rates? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, we're watching-we have a strong forecast, generally, for next year. That forecast involves growth, you know, between 2 and 2Â½ percent. It involves growth at a strong enough level to continue driving unemployment down and inflation near 2 percent. So that's a pretty positive forecast. So, to make further moves, I'll be looking for data that suggests that that's, in fact, the path that we're on. As I mentioned, once you-once you're, broadly speaking, in the range of neutral, I think it's appropriate to be putting aside individual estimates of that and be looking at what the incoming data are telling you about the outlook, updating your estimates of what neutral might be, of what the natural rate of unemployment might be, of the state of the economy, so-and letting that lead you to adjust your outlook and, therefore, your appropriate path for policy. So that's what we mean when we say we're ""data dependent."" Of course, we're always data dependent, but I think it has a particular meaning in this context, which is that. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to ask, first of all, whether you're worried that President Trump's tweeting and statements might interfere with your ability to communicate with markets and why you're doing what you're doing. And then, also, I was wondering if you could comment on-Governor Brainard gave a speech recently where she laid out the case for the countercyclical capital buffer being activated. Do you disagree with her analysis? Is that something that you think the Fed should look at doing? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I'm not worried, because-about-on the first question-because I know, and everyone who works at the Fed knows, that we're going to do our jobs the way we've always done them. And that involves, you know, I think getting the best thinking together, diverse perspectives. We-every business-every FOMC cycle, we talk to hundreds of people in all different parts of society, not just business people or market people, but people from community development organizations. We get survey data from thousands of people, and so we really do have a pretty broad exposure to what's going on in all different parts of the country. And we're going to take all that information, and we're going to make the best decisions we can, and nothing will cause us to deviate from that. In terms of the CCyB, so the CCyB is-the countercyclical capital buffer is a tool that allows us to build capital at a time when vulnerabilities-financial stability vulnerabilities-are meaningfully above normal. And so that's a tool I'd be absolutely willing to use and happy to use at such time as that test is met. We meet and discuss that and evaluate it on roughly an annual basis. We haven't done it since early this year. I think we'll be doing it early next year, and we'll be reaching that judgment then. I will tell you, I recently gave a speech saying that I believe that financial stability vulnerabilities were roughly at a moderate level. So, for me, that-but I would want to leave open-my mind open on that and have that discussion with my Board colleagues when the issue arises. ANN SAPHIR. Ann Saphir with Reuters. You said that policy does not need, at this point, to be accommodative. But does it need to be restrictive, as the dots seem to suggest that it will be? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Does it currently need to be restrictive? No. And I don't believe that it is. I don't believe that policy is restrictive. ANN SAPHIR. Next year. The dots suggest it will be restrictive next year. Should it be? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yeah, I-I've discussed this a couple of times. It's a very good question. And I guess I would just go back to this: The individual forecasts are not something that the Committee votes on. They're out in the future. We vote on the rate increase, and we write down our-you know, our own personal paths. So people have disparate views on what the endpoint could be. Ultimately, it's going to depend on what the circumstances are. There would be circumstances in which it would be appropriate to go past neutral, and there would be circumstances in which it would be wholly inappropriate to do so. So I don't-I wouldn't put too much on-it does inform you, the way people are thinking about things. But don't-I wouldn't take it as a signal about current policy or about near-term policy. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thanks for the question. In Dallas last month you talked about the usefulness of speaking with businesses, sometimes hearing things that aren't yet showing up in the economic data. And I was just wondering if you're hearing anything from businesses that might explain the recent market moves. You know, are markets on to something that, again, hasn't showed up yet in the data? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, if you look at the Tealbook, or-you know, we get the Tealbook in person from the Reserve Bank presidents who come in, and they share their discussions not just with their directors, but with literally hundreds of business and nonprofit, you know, and labor union people around the country. And I personally find it really interesting. My background is very much working-starting with, you know, a small group of people, maybe a company, and working out. So that kind of anecdotal data really helps me capture the picture better. So-and, you know, what-what you're picking up now, I think, is, there's, you know, a mood of concern, or it's a mood of angst about growth going forward, if I could just capture it in one thought. There are many reasons that are given for that, but, generally speaking, it's-it's a concern about, is growth going to be as strong as it was? Why not? What might it be-to different people? But that mood is out there. That doesn't mean that it'll come into the real data in a big way-it may, but-or that financial conditions will tighten further. We'll just have to see. For now, financial conditions have tightened a little bit. We've taken that on board both in the outcomes, in our forecast, but also in a lower rate path to-you know, to provide some accommodation to push back against that tightening. That's how I think about it. GREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Just following up on Paul's question-President Trump said recently that you should feel the markets. So when you see the markets, you know, what are the markets telling you? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, financial conditions-broadly speaking, we don't look at any one market. We look at a really big range of financial conditions. And what matters for the broader economy is material changes in a broad range of financial conditions that are sustained for a period of time. A little bit of volatility-speaking in the abstract-some volatility doesn't probably leave a mark on the economy. So we look for that. And, you know, what we've seen here is a tightening. There's been a tightening since right around after-a week or so after the September meeting. And, you know, that-we tried to factor that into our models of the economy and to the results that come out of those models. That's how we think about it. So we do, you know-we follow markets really carefully. But, remember, from a macroeconomic standpoint, no one market is the single dominant indicator and it really matters if changes are sustained over time. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Do you still think core PCE is a good measure of whether the economy is overheating? What do you think of other measures like setting a target for economic growth and relying more on that? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Well, I think we look at both, but core PCE is a good indicator. It has-what's happened over, really, 50 years is that inflation has become much less reactive to changes in growth. There was a time when inflation reacted really quickly to changes in growth and changes in unemployment, and that time is behind us. And that is often attributed to the success of central banks in anchoring inflation expectations so that people believe that inflation will come back to the target or around the target so it doesn't go down as much-inflation doesn't go down as much in a downturn and doesn't go up as much when the-you know, when the economy is strong. It's really true, though, that inflation has not reacted a lot on a road from 10 percent unemployment to now 3.7 percent unemployment. Now, it did move up last year. But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think-I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices. Most of the time, those two things work together. When they work temporarily in different ways, we take a balanced approach. But I think that approach has served us well, and I think we can work well with it. DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. Next year, every meeting will be a live meeting. So, presumably, there will be some adjustment in how the market anticipates when a rate hike is coming. How has the Committee thought through communicating those potential policy moves, especially in light of the fact of the tremendous amount of uncertainty going into next year? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I think having regular press conferences will be a big gain for communication. I certainly hope it will. That's the plan. And so, being able to come out after each meeting and explain the Committee's thinking and relate that to the state of the economy and expectations for policy and global developments, I think it'll be-the idea is that it'll be helpful in explaining how we're thinking and, you know, explaining what we're thinking about policy going forward. So that's the plan. I do believe it will be a positive development. I think it'll also become the case, over time, that there will be no ""prior"" as to whether we would move at a quarterly meeting or one of the meetings at which we do not file an SEP. As you know, we only update our projections under the current approach quarterly, whereas we have eight-eight meetings. So I think we'll move to a more-we'll have the ability to move eight-at eight different meetings. Not eight times, but at eight different meetings on the year. DONNA BORAK. I guess that's sort of the question that I'm trying to drive at is, in terms of communicating to the market, because we've been-the market's been so adjusted to the fact that these are quarter-end rate hikes, and now you have the potential to move eight times a year-is the Fed thinking through how it's going to communicate when it plans, especially given the amount of uncertainty? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. I mean, I think that's probably pretty straightforward. If we, you know-if we're-if we want to communicate something about something that's going to happen in a future meeting, I think we know how to do that in speeches, in press conferences, and such. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. You mentioned broad-based wage gains this year, and I'm wondering if you see further acceleration in wage growth and just how much slack there is in the labor market. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So what we've seen is, is a very gradual-and, I think, ongoing-increase in wages. If you go back a few years, you'll see that we look at many, many indicators of wages and compensation. But there are four principal ones. And they were all kind of clustered around 2-if you go back five years ago-2 percent increase per year. Now they are all at 3, and they've just continued to gradually move up-not perfectly in sync, but-and that's a number that is, you know, right in keeping with 2 percent inflation and 1 percent productivity growth. So in an economic sense, it makes sense. I do expect, and I think many forecasters expect, that wage increases will continue, and that would be a welcome development. Wage-wage increases do not need to be inflationary. There's plenty of evidence of situations-for example, in the very tight labor market of the late 1990s of a-I think I mentioned in a speech a month or so ago, we had wage increases above productivity plus inflation, and we didn't have high inflation. So it would be welcome. We hear a great deal of anecdotal information about labor shortages, along with other, you know, bottlenecks and things. So I would expect that wages will keep moving up, and it doesn't necessarily mean inflation. We don't think of it that way. So did that answer your question? DON LEE. Labor slack? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Labor slack. Yes. So, you know, by most indicators-we look at a very wide range of indicators on the labor market. And, by most indicators, we are at or even above longer-run normal levels. But I would point to one particular pocket, and that is, labor force participation by younger prime-age workers, particularly prime-age males, is still, you know, meaningfully below its pre-crisis level. Most other age groups in both genders have moved back up pretty close to where they were at the last cyclical peak. You know, there's a question, can we go above that cyclical peak? And-or, or are the problems more structural than cyclical, and that there isn't-so we'll have to find that out. I think, given the strong economy, we've had the luxury of finding out that labor force participation can be higher than we had thought. And that's nothing but a good thing. JOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker. A regulatory question, if I may. So, many of the Fed's regulatory proposals so far, especially this year, have been primarily focused on banks in the sort of medium-to-small range. That is, a sort of tailoring enhanced prudential standards, particularly for those banks, and I'm thinking of the stress capital buffer as well as the most recent proposal on banks between $100 and $250 billion. G-SIBs and the largest banks seem to be sort of left out in a lot of these proposals, and I'm wondering if that is meant to send a message that the Fed does not really intend to change its regulatory structure for the largest banks going forward, or if you'll get to that maybe later. And I'm thinking specifically of the G-SIB capital surcharge, which several members of Congress have sent letters to you asking you to revisit and reconsider. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So you're right that a big focus of what we have been doing has been tailoring regulations. And the sense of ""tailoring"" is that we want to look below the level of the G-SIBs at the large regionals and then on down to the community banks at various steps and ask whether we have appropriately tailored regulation and supervision to account for the fact that smaller and less complex organizations present a much less significant threat to the economy and to the community should they fail-should they experience material difficulty. So, in the nature of that, you're focused more on the smaller institutions. I think, with the larger institutions, we want regulation and supervision to be effective and efficient. I know that the larger institutions tend to be the ones who care about the Volcker rule. That's something we're working on. You know, we-we think that things need to be looked at carefully. And, again, I wouldn't want to materially change capital levels, because, I think, you know, it's important that the largest financial institutions, the largest and most complex-the systemically important ones be held to the highest standards and higher expectations. And while we may tailor some regulations, those fundamentally high expectations are not going to change. STEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, freelance financial journalist reporting for NPR, Chairman Powell. I know you look at many different financial indicators, but let me focus your attention briefly on bond yields. The 10-year note yield has gone down pretty steeply, roughly 50 basis points, I think, in recent weeks. I wonder what you make of it. Is it a worrisome sign for you in terms of the outlook for growth, for inflation? On the other hand, could it be a positive, in terms of presumably bringing down mortgage rates and helping the housing sector? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Again, we do focus on a broad range of financial indicators, and I-really, we don't obsess about any particular one. You know, we look at a whole range of them, and we ask ourselves, what's really going on in the broad picture out there? You know, if you ask what's going on with the long-certainly the long, longer-maturity Treasury market has come in some. That's consistent with, you know, a risk-off feeling in the stock market as well. And, you know, we don't know whether that'll persist. Really, the longer Treasury has moved in a range above 3 percent and down 3 percent as the risk sentiment has changed. You know, I think if rates were to stay low for a longer period of time, that could be thought of as a signal of expectations of lower growth. But, you know, we don't know that that'll happen. As I mentioned, our forecast for next year is-I think, in keeping with most other forecasts-is that we'll still have solid growth next year, declining unemployment, and a healthy economy. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Chairman, Courtenay Brown from Axios. I'm wondering if you could clear up what's become a little bit of a debate in the financial community. You said in October in an interview with PBS that interest rates were a long way from neutral. A month later you said interest rates were just below neutral. And I think a lot of people interpreted that as a shift in tone from you. Were they right to interpret it that way? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I'm going to-I'm just going to stick with that. It's-where we are right now is, we're at the lower end of the range of neutral. We've arrived effectively at the bottom end of that range. And, you know, there are implications of that. For that, as I mentioned, going forward, there's real uncertainty about the path-the pace, rather, and the destination for further rate increases. And we're going to be letting incoming data inform our thinking about the appropriate path. MICHELLE FLEURY. Michelle Fleury, BBC News. Chairman Powell, you talked about monitoring global developments. I was wondering, you touched on trade, the trade dispute with China. But could you elaborate on what economic developments you're referring to, whether Brexit is one of those? What else? CHAIRMAN POWELL. More broadly, I'm referring to global growth. So, if you go back a year, 2017 was a year of kind of ongoing upside surprises in global growth. It was the year of synchronized global growth. And people raised their forecasts for growth around the world kind of throughout 2017 and, in some sense, expected that to continue into 2018. What has happened instead has been a modest retracing of that. So you have still healthy levels of growth in the aggregate around the world but close to the potential growth rate of, you know, the global economy. But you no longer have the really strong levels of growth you had in 2017. So that is one-that's, I think, the key fact. We also monitor, you know, event risks like Brexit-like, you know, like the negotiations between Italy and the EU over their budget. And, you know, as far as those are concerned, we monitor them very carefully. And I'm going to-I'll mention Brexit. Our financial institutions have had a long time now to get ready for the full range of possible exits from the EU by the U.K. And they've had supervisory involvement from U.S. supervisors, from U.K. supervisors, from EU supervisors-we think they are fully prepared for the full range of outcomes that may come out of that. I was very happy to see the developments around central counterparties today. That was a big issue that seems to have been satisfactorily, for the time being, resolved. So it's something we're watching carefully. Honestly, it shouldn't have major implications for the United States, but, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty because it's not something that's happened before. So we'll be watching it carefully. Thanks very much."
