"HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So you've said many times recently that policy was still accommodative and that it needn't be so. You've said recently that policy-the state of the policy was still accommodative and that the economy didn't require that anymore. Is that still the case? If so, how do you justify the removal of the need for some further interest rate increases? Basically, are we at neutral now, or does the economy still need accommodation? CHAIRMAN POWELL. We think that our policy is at the appropriate point right now. We think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We do. We also know that our policy rate is now in the range of the Committee's estimates of neutral. So we'll be-again, we think our policy stance is appropriate. HEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. Last week, the IMF said risks are clearly skewed to the downside for the U.S. and global economy. Can you clarify-does the FOMC see risks as skewed to the downside, particularly after you removed the statement about risks being balanced? CHAIRMAN POWELL. We had an extensive discussion of the baseline and also of the risks to the baseline, and the risks are, of course, the fact that financial conditions have tightened, that global growth has slowed, as well as some, let's say, government-related risks like Brexit and trade discussions, and also the effects and ultimate disposition of the shutdown. So we looked at-we look at those, and the way we think of it is that policy-we will use our policy, and we have, to offset risks to the baseline. So we view the baseline as still solid, and part of that is the way we adjusted our baseline to address those risks. So that's the way we're thinking about that now. SAM FLEMING. Thanks. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. The Fed has linked its commitment to patience in part to subdued inflation outcomes. Would you be comfortable with continuing patience even if there are modest, if transient, overshoots to the inflation target by core inflation? How sensitive are you right now to developments in core inflation when determining the next move? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, generally speaking, we think the outlook is favorable, and we think that these crosscurrents that I referred to-these risks-are going to be with us for a while. We think our stance is appropriate. We think there's no pressing need to change our policy stance and no need to rush to judgment there. I would say that we'll be looking at a full range of data, and that will include inflation data. It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. Remember that our inflation objective is a symmetric one, meaning that we are-we're always trying to get to 2 percent, and we don't look at-we look at inflation equally on both sides. So I can't get into specific hypotheticals, but I do believe that we have a symmetric objective, and I believe we'll act that way. RICHARD MILLER. We learned from the last minutes of the meeting that some of the tweaks you make to the statement have a lot more portent than we thought. In light of that, I'm wondering if you can provide us with a ""decoder ring"" for this statement. ""Adjustments""-does that suggest the next move in interest rates is as likely to be up as down? And when you twin ""in light of global economic and financial developments"" with ""muted inflation pressures,"" does that suggest you have to see both the cessation of these crosscurrents that you've talked about and inflation moving up before you get off the dime, so to speak, and move? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Sorry-say again what the first question was? RICHARD MILLER. First question is, ""adjustments""-is that meant to imply the next move is as most likely to be up as down? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. I'm just going to say that the-it's going to depend entirely on the data. We're not making a judgment. We don't have a strong prior. We will be-we will patiently wait and let the data clarify. Some of the crosscurrents that I refer to may be with us for a while, and I think we'll be looking at seeing those clear up as it relates to-as they relate to the outlook for the U.S. and that will be an important aspect as well. Your second question was? RICHARD MILLER. Would it be not just the cessation of those crosscurrents, but the end of these muted inflation pressures-are they both sort of things that are necessary for you to change this ""patient"" stance? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, it's really hard to speak about generalities. We'll be looking at everything, but I do think that, you know, muted inflation pressures-you know, you would want-I would want to see a need for further rate increases, and, for me, a big part of that would be inflation. It wouldn't be the only thing, but it would certainly be important. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, did the Committee discuss an actual change to the runoff policy or the runoff schedule right now? If so, is that under consideration right now, and when might we know? The second thing is, I have to nail down this thing. You guys, Fed folks, keep mentioning the ""market average"" or the ""market outlook"" for the size of the balance sheet. Are you endorsing the market average, which is 3Â½ trillion? And if you're not endorsing it, why do you keep mentioning it? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Okay. So today I'm here to talk about decisions and also discussions about decisions that haven't been made. So we're talking about the latter thing, which is discussions, and so I can't get ahead of where decisions are. But so the Committee is-what we're looking to do is create a whole plan that will bring us to our goal, our longer-run goal, which is a balance sheet no larger than it needs to be for us to efficiently conduct-efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, but to do so in a way that doesn't put our goals at risk or result in unnecessary market turmoil. So there are a lot of pieces to that, and we've learned over time that it's-when making these-when designing these plans, like, for example, the original normalization plan, it's good to take your time. Let the best ideas rise to the top. Let them stand the test of time and argument and then move when you're really comfortable with what you've got and when you feel you can communicate it clearly. So I don't want to get ahead of that process today. But-so we've discussed-there are a number of pieces to that puzzle. There are several different pieces to them, and I think they're coming-and I'm very pleased with the progress that we've made, and, you know, the piece that you mentioned is something that is in those discussions. That's the first question. I'm not going to give our estimate or ratify anybody else's estimate of what the equilibrium balance sheet is here today. There are estimates out there, but I'm not at a point today where I'm going to be giving out numbers on that. But there are estimates, and I think they're consistent with what I said, broadly speaking. STEVE LIESMAN. So, just to clarify-I'm sorry, you did discuss reducing the pace of the runoff? That sounds like what you said, to me. CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes, it's-so, again, we haven't made any decisions. There no decisions have been made. There are different pieces of the thing, and that is in the discussion as one of many pieces that is in the discussion. And that was reflected in the last minutes, actually. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thanks. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chairman Powell, I want to follow up on Steve's question. The size of the balance sheet obviously matters a great deal, but, so, too, if you follow the arguments that were made when the Fed was purchasing these assets, does the duration of those holdings. So once you are-once you reach the terminal level of reserves and you have to reinvest maturing mortgage-backed securities into Treasuries, it will matter a great deal, of course, where along the curve the Fed resumes those reinvestments. And so I wonder, what does your staff research show about the degree of accommodation that would be provided by either moving to the front end of the curve and holding or investing, perhaps, in shorter maturity assets, versus the other approach that was identified in the December meeting minutes, which would be to simply reflect issuance of the outstanding Treasury maturities? And which approach do you think is more appropriate in the current environment? CHAIRMAN POWELL. These are great questions. Let me say that the question of the ultimate composition of our balance sheet in the longer run is a very important one, and it's one that we see ourselves as coming to, you know, fairly soon, as in, in coming meetings. It won't be the first thing we work on, but it will be one of the first things that we try to resolve. We had discussions at one of the last two meetings on this, and we haven't come to a judgment on that. And, you know, I wouldn't comment beyond saying that we understand that's a key question, and there are, you know, there are issues to be decided. There are benefits and costs to doing-to taking different approaches, and I wouldn't want to prejudge them today. BINYAMIN APPELBAUM. Binya Appelbaum, New York Times. I am struggling a little bit to understand what has changed since we sat here with you six weeks ago. You've said today that you think that inflation would be the reason that the Fed would need to continue raising rates. Has the inflation outlook shifted that dramatically in the last six weeks? Can you speak specifically to why you've moved from a posture of saying we expect to keep raising rates this year to a posture of standing still? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I'd point to a couple of things. First, the narrative of slowing global growth continues, if you will. The incoming data have shown more of that. We've seen that both in China and in Western Europe, and so that's an important-that has important implications for us, and that story has-let's just say it continues. And, in addition-I mean, I think important-possibly less important now-probably less important now, but-has been the shutdown, which will leave some sort of imprint on first-quarter GDP. We don't know the ultimate resolution of it. If that's all there is, and the shutdown is gone and there isn't another shutdown, then we'll get most of that back in the second period-second quarter. So those things-in addition, you know, you have to look back. Financial conditions began to tighten in the fourth quarter. And they now have persisted and remain tighter-significantly tighter, let's say-than they were, and that's something that we have to take into account as well. So that's where we are. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. You said you like to be a plain speaker, so let me try to have you put this as plainly as possible. Is it fair to characterize this as not a pause in a tightening cycle, but the end of the tightening cycle now-a new regime for the Fed? And, if not, can you put a time frame on ""patient""? Does ""patient"" have some sort of time frame? And I'm wondering about your reaction to the criticism you got on your December 19th news conference, your later statements-do you feel you've put a ""Powell put"" into the markets? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, patience-I think we're going to know in hindsight, because the length of this patient period is going to depend entirely on incoming data and its implications for the outlook. So that's going to be-so it's hard to say, you know, it's hard to think of what to call it at this point or how to label it. So really, your second question is about how do we think about financial conditions. And I would say this: We think about a broad range of financial conditions, not just one or two things. You know, it's interest rates, it's risk spreads, it's currency, it's the stock market, it's credit availability, it's many, many factors. And what matters for financial conditions is, when there are changes and those changes are sustained for a period of time, then they become important for us because they have important macroeconomic implications. So that's how we think about it. So we don't react to, you know, to most things that happen in the financial markets. But when we see a sustained change in financial conditions, then that's something that has to play into our thinking. In fact, our policy works through changing financial conditions, so it's sort of the essence of what we do. VICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. I just wanted to ask, first of all, about whether the Fed is gathering information about some of the new money laundering information that's come out about Deutsche Bank and Danske Bank and whether you have any concerns there? And then, also, I was just wondering if you could say whether there's any kind of timeline on when the Fed might make a decision on real-time payments and whether you're going to build a real-time payment system? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Right. So, on the first question, I can-we don't comment on individual investigations or whether they're happening. I will say that we take our enforcement powers very seriously, and we put them to work when we feel it's justified. In terms of real-time payments, it's something we're very actively working on. As you obviously know, we have some proposals out, and we're considering them. You know, the thing is, it's very important in that space to consult with the full range of market participants and interest groups, consumer groups, and we've done that, as I'm sure you know, over a period of years. We don't have plenary authority to just do things, for the most part, in the payment space. We've been more of a convener, bringing industry and the public-public interest groups-and all those groups around the table. And we've-I think we've played a constructive role in that respect, and I believe that will continue. JIM PUZZANGHERA. Thanks. Jim Puzzanghera with the L.A. Times. You and your colleagues may have noticed, President Trump, for the past six months, has been urging the Fed not to raise rates-to stop raising rates. How would you respond to those who would suggest that the Fed just caved to the president's demands? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So what we care about-and, really, the only thing we care about at the Fed-is doing our job for the American people and using our tools appropriately. So that's very strongly our culture. I think anyone who knows the Fed or who has worked at the Fed would recognize that description. So we're always going to do what we think is the right thing. We're never going to take political considerations into account or discuss them as part of our work. You know, we're human. We make mistakes. But we're not going to make mistakes of character or integrity. And I would want the public to know that, and I would want them to see that in our actions. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business News. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The long-term federal funds rate is 2.8 percent. I've talked the last year with a number of Fed presidents who worry that under 3 percent is not enough to handle the next recession. You say that's your first tool, that's your primary means of adjusting monetary policy. So with a larger balance sheet-with a larger balance sheet, could you-how could you handle that next recession, then, with the combination of those two? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I guess the sense of your question is that we could be in a situation in the future-we hope not, but-we could be in a situation where we'd like to cut rates more than we can effectively, and we hit the zero lower bound. We don't think anything like that is in the cards. Now, there's no reason to think that it would be. But as we said in today's release, if that happens, then we'll use the full range of our tools, and that includes the balance sheet. But we would use it after using our conventional tools, which would be the interest rate and forward guidance about the interest rate. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Even if you have a large balance sheet-$4 trillion? Above $4 trillion? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Yes. There would be room to do substantially more. DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. I just wanted to go back to-you had mentioned on the crosscurrents, the government shutdown issue. You mentioned a couple of weeks ago that that information would clearly show up in the data. I'm wondering, as you guys discussed during this week's meeting, what the potential economic impact would be of the shutdown, the possibility of a second one, whether or not it would diminish consumer confidence, have some severe ripple effects? Just talking to other folks outside, businesses-clearly they were suffering and seeing a lot of pain. I'm just wondering about, for American families that missed two paychecks, how is this going to play out for them for the months to come? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Right. So let me give you the economic side of it first-is that, even with a fairly long shutdown, as long as that's the end of it and everyone gets their backpay-except the contractors, I guess, the private-sector contractors, but-some people get their backpay, then the lost GDP will be regained in the second quarter. So that's that. I would say that the-you know, we all see the suffering and the heartbreak and all the pain people go through. I see, you know, federal employees doing their work, and I'm, you know, really grateful they did. I mean, to be doing your work while you're not getting paid, it's something we should all be grateful for. Did that answer both your questions? DONNA BORAK. Yes, it does. So you don't see a permanent effect of this shutdown? And I'm just wondering if you're thinking about the path of future policy and the possibility of reaching this point again on February 15? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So would there be a permanent effect? As I mentioned, there wouldn't be if there isn't another shutdown. If there were going to be a permanent effect or a lasting effect, let's say, it would be from a longer shutdown or perhaps a second shutdown, and that would be through the channel of a loss of confidence in our ability to make policy in the United States. That would be the channel. And I think that was something that we and many others were worried about as there was talk of an even longer shutdown. In terms of ideas for not having more shutdowns, I know Congress is actually looking at some of those, so I think that could be a profitable thing to explore. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, AP. The Beige Book that was prepared for this meeting noted a rising concern among business contacts about higher trade tariffs and the tensions there. Did that play a part in the discussion and the decision that you made on shifting the wording in your statement? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, trade-you sound like you're an avid reader of the Beige Book, and that's great-the trade, as you will know, then-trade has been a big feature in the Beige Book for some time now. The Beige Book is a collection of all of our-of the comments that our Reserve Bank presidents get from their Districts. It's incredibly valuable, because you're getting actual reports from people who are on the line. And there have been real concerns about trade right along the line, both in terms of availability of materials and costs and retaliation and that kind of thing. So that's been a concern. I would say the longer-term concern, though, is the negotiations that are going on. If they linger, then there could be more and more uncertainty, and you worry over time that that could have an effect on business confidence. So far, the actual amount of tariffs that have been applied both here and in China is not enough to have material effects on GDP either here or in China. So the concern is more a longer-for me-a longer, drawn-out set of negotiations back and forth, which could result in sapping business confidence. Uncertainty is not the friend of business. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. I'm Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace. I want to talk to you about corporate debt. Are you worried that by taking a pause in raising interest rates-we've had low interest rates for so long-are you contributing to a bubble in corporate debt? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, we did-we've called out corporate debt as a risk-more of a macroeconomic risk, I think, than a financial stability risk, the sense of that being that if you have companies that are highly levered and we do go into a downturn, they're going to be less able to weather that and keep serving their customers and, you know, may have to do layoffs and things like that. So they can amplify, in effect, a negative downturn. So we watch that. We also watch carefully for the exposure of the financial system to these companies. In other words, banks are arranging a lot of these loans. The question is, what is their exposure? Do they retain big pieces of the loans? Do they have obligations to underwrite loans which build up in a pipeline? So we monitor those risks very carefully. And, frankly, the banks monitor them much better with our support and help than they did before the crisis. So it's a concern. It's something that we're watching. Of course, you know, November, December, and January were much slower months for those sorts of things. But, you know, it'll be something that we're always paying close attention to. GREG ROBB. Chairman Powell, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Financial markets have reacted strongly to the decision and the press conference. The Dow Jones industrial average is up more than, like, 500 points. There's a sense in the market that there's, you know, what people call the ""Powell put"" on the markets. Are financial markets wrong in that assessment? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I would point to all the continuity here. You know, the thing we did on the balance sheet is something we've been working on for, frankly, years-the thing we announced today. And so we're providing clarity there. I think that's a constructive thing to do. My-honestly-only motivation is to do the right thing for the economy and for the American people-that's it. And this situation, I think, calls for patience-I think it does. And it's just the stance of policy we think is appropriate. We see these uncertainties, and we see a time when we can afford to-we have the luxury of being able to wait and watch, and that's what we're planning to do. And I think it's the right thing. I feel strongly that it is. JOHN HELTMAN. Chairman Powell, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency last year completed its fintech charter. And one of the questions around that charter has been whether the Federal Reserve will allow such a chartered bank to access the payment system. I'm curious if you think a fintech charter is a good idea in general, and what conditions you think might be necessary to allow the Fed to allow such a chartered institution access to the payment system. CHAIRMAN POWELL. I'm not going to be able to help you much on that. Those are great questions, and those are questions that are, you know, that our great supervisory people are looking at. I think we're open to these ideas, but I don't have any news for you on that today. STEVE BECKNER. Thank you. Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR. Mr. Chairman, you've echoed the widespread concern about slowing growth in China and elsewhere in the world, but I wonder whether it's possible that slower growth abroad might actually be beneficial to this country, in some respects, at least-for example, perhaps increasing capital inflows and putting downward pressure on long-term rates in this country, as happened in the Asian financial crisis in the late '90s. CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, Steve, it's certainly possible. Ultimately, though, you know, a strong global economy is good for us. We export to these countries. We trade with these countries. I mean, part of the story of 2017, for example, was that European growth kept coming in stronger and stronger, and that meant the euro was strong, and that supported our exports. So, ultimately, I think we benefit from having strong growth abroad, although you point to an interesting case. MARK HAMRICK. Chairman Powell, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. Thank you. As you probably heard, the Congressional Budget Office is projecting that federal debt is expected to surge to about $29 trillion over the next 10 years, reaching the highest share since the end of World War II. First of all, does that sound like it could be a reasonable forecast, with the Administration seeming to take plenty of opportunities to question the legitimacy of CBO? And then, secondly, what effect does that have on interest rates and the public if indeed that's even close to being true? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, first, it is important-we don't do fiscal policy. We don't advise the government or Congress on fiscal policy, so I'll limit myself to more high-level comments and say that it is not a secret-it is a long-known fact that the U.S. federal government budget is on an unsustainable path, and that needs to be addressed. And that is driven principally by the combination of health-care costs-really, due to our health-care delivery system-and the aging of the population. And there's no time like now-when the economy is healthy, growing, people are working-to go after that problem. Ultimately, we will have to. We don't have a forecast. We don't forecast those things. I have no reason to doubt CBO's numbers on this. I haven't actually looked at that report, but my general experience with them is that it's a professional outfit. MARK HAMRICK. What does that look like, if that really takes place 10 years down the road? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So, you know, first of all, our-the work that we do relates more to the medium term rather than the long term. And so I don't see this, in particular, as a threat to this business cycle or to the economy this year. It's more in the longer run, we'll be spending all of our money on paying interest and not on the things that we really need to be doing for future generations and for our own generation. So it's a serious problem, but it's not a problem that is something that either helps or prevents the Fed from doing our job today. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. I know where the FOMC participants' estimates for the long-run interest rate are. They're all above 2Â½ percent. Right now we're between 2.25 and 2Â½. So I think a key question right now is, is policy accommodative at this moment? Are we looking at staying accommodative for some time, or has your estimate of neutral come down, in light of the recent volatility in markets? Thanks. CHAIRMAN POWELL. So the range of estimates on the Committee starts at 2Â½ percent, and that's kind of roughly where we currently are. And as I've said a couple of times, when you get to that range-you know that we can't directly observe the neutral rate. We only know it by its works. And so we have to put aside our own priors of what that rate might be and let the data speak to us. So we can do that. We're in the range. There are a number of Committee members who are, you know, right around that range. And I think we're watching to see. We don't-I don't-again, I think that our policy stance today is appropriate for the state of the economy. That's my feeling. We're going to be watching data to see whether that's right, and we're also going to be watching data to see how these crosscurrents resolve themselves and how the U.S. economy performs this year. VIRGINIE MONTET. Thank you. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse. Among the global developments that the Fed is monitoring, how much of a risk for the American expansion would be the prospect of a ""hard"" Brexit? CHAIRMAN POWELL. So we've been monitoring the Brexit situation very carefully for a long time. And for us, that starts with U.S. financial institutions that have a presence either in the U.K. or in the EU or both. So we have worked with those institutions alongside U.K. and EU regulators to assure ourselves that those firms have plans and have liquidity and have all of the things they will need to deal with the full range of Brexit outcomes. So we've done a lot of work on that, and, generally speaking-again, a lot of work has been done-we have to be humble and say that this is an unprecedented event. But that's the financial system aspect of it. If there is a hard Brexit, then that would very likely involve disruptions both to the continental economy and certainly to the U.K. economy, and we would feel that. The question for us-it wouldn't be a huge first-order thing, the economic effects, unless you saw financial disruptions. So, if you saw financial turmoil and that kind of thing, that would be the way it would reach us. I would expect that we would feel some of this, and it's very hard to have great confidence that you know what that would be. But it would be something-probably not material to our economy, but it's something we'll be watching very carefully and certainly hoping that there is a resolution short of a hard Brexit. JEAN YUNG. Hi, I'm Jean Yung with Market News. I have a question about the ultimate size of the balance sheet. How will the Fed judge what is a reasonable level for financial institutions' demand for reserves when it appears to be rising at a fast pace over the past year and perhaps at a faster pace than can be explained by regulatory changes during that same time frame? Would you prefer to err on the side of being more generous, or would you try to encourage banks from holding-to hold less reserves? CHAIRMAN POWELL. Let me be clear. I don't know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years. I think our understanding of demand for reserves-remember that the banks have more reserves than they need. Reserves are still quite abundant. So the question is, how much of that amount is actually going to be needed in the end after, you know, after the firms adjust to our very gradual decrease? And so our understanding, really, of the distribution of reserves and how much will be needed has moved up over the past year. And then there would be a buffer on top of that. And then we would want to be-we would want to have a buffer, as I mentioned in my remarks, because we want to be operating in an abundant reserves regime where we operate through our administered rates. If you operate too close to that point of scarcity, then you wind up having to have these big, ongoing interventions in the market. We don't want the Fed to have a, you know, a large ongoing presence in the market around this. We'd rather just, you know-in managing the federal funds rate, we'd rather have it set by our administered rates. So that implies you'd want to be a bit above what that equilibrium demand for reserves is. And, again, there's no cookbook here, there's no playbook. No one really knows. The only way you can figure it out is by surveying people and market intelligence and then, ultimately, by approaching that point quite carefully. JEAN YUNG. But do you take the survey results as given, or do you try to encourage banks from holding a [inaudible]? CHAIRMAN POWELL. We don't take-you know, we don't think we have a precise understanding of this at all. I want to be clear about that. These estimates are fairly uncertain. So if you think that the level of demand for reserves is here [gesturing with hands together, in the middle], all you can say is, it's probably somewhere in this range [gesturing with hands apart, equidistant from the middle]. If banks want to use reserves for a good and sufficient reason-which is to say, to hold liquidity as we require them to do to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, to meet their resolution requirements and resolution planning-we're not going to discourage them from holding them. They are, in fact, a very safe asset-in a way, the safest asset. And we want the banks to be safe and sound. We didn't create the reserves, you know, with that in mind, but, you know, since-in the post-crisis, you know, regulatory regime, we have brand-new and quite substantial liquidity requirements, which are very good and which have great public benefit. So it's not a bad thing that banks hold onto these reserves or another safe asset. We don't-we're not encouraging them to hold reserves instead of Treasuries. Treasuries or reserves are roughly equivalent for this purpose. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. A data-dependency question: Has there been a prioritization of market data over the economic data? How do you balance those two things? CHAIRMAN POWELL. I would say that, you know, our mandate is maximum employment and stable prices, and that's about, you know, hard, real-side economic data. We-as I mentioned earlier, we-our tool, you know, our interest rate tool operates on the economy through financial conditions. So financial conditions matter, and they matter in the way that I suggested earlier-which is to say, broad financial conditions changing over a sustained period-that has implications for the macroeconomy. It does. So if you lower interest rates and they stay low, every borrower in the country ultimately has a lower interest rate. That'll have an effect on-over time, an effect on the economy. But, again, the entire focus we have is on maximum employment and stable prices, not on any particular financial market or financial conditions generally. MYLES UDLAND. Chairman Powell, Myles Udland with Yahoo Finance. I would just ask, I guess, about the balance sheet in general. And are you surprised at how much of a conversation we're having around the balance sheet, and how much talk about the balance sheet from yourself and various Fed officials have moved financial markets? Because putting out a statement, clarifying your view on the balance sheet, you know, is somewhat surprising, considering it is restating, you know, what the Fed had said all along was the goal with balance sheet normalization-to roll it off, not have it be a key part of policy. And so I would just ask, are you surprised by how far that conversation has gotten just in the last six weeks? CHAIRMAN POWELL. You know, I'll quickly go back-in 2017, we were-in designing the normalization plan, we were concerned at not having two active tools of policy. We learned during the taper tantrum, frankly, in 2013 that was-that would be confusing to markets. So what we did was we set up the normalization of the balance sheet in a way that was very transparent so that you could look and know really, certainly as to Treasuries, pretty much the exact amounts and the timing in which we would be returning these assets to private hands. And we put that out there very publicly and in the hope that it would be priced in and understood, and that then we could put the balance sheet on the side and have interest rates be the active tool of policy. So that went along that way very well, and I think that division of labor was a good one for our policy and for the benefit of the country. I think that there's-I think the market is now looking for more clarity around that, and I think we'll be providing it. That's what's happened. Thanks very much."

"HEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. On the broader economy, can you clarify how worried the FOMC is about a steep slowdown? Some of the actions today look like there is more worry. And on the balance sheet, can you clarify: Does the FOMC see the runoff as a form of monetary tightening? CHAIR POWELL. So, on the outlook, our outlook is a positive one. So, as I mentioned, FOMC participants continue to see growth this year of around 2 percent, just a bit below what we saw back in-at the end of last year. And part of that is seeing that economic fundamentals-underlying economic fundamentals are still very strong. You have a strong labor market by most measures. You have rising incomes. You've got very low unemployment. You have confidence surveys for households and also for businesses that are at attractive levels, and you also have financial conditions that are more accommodative than they were a couple of months ago. So we see the outlook as a positive one. As far as balance sheet-the balance sheet plan, the answer to that is, you asked whether that's related to our monetary policy, in effect, and the answer is really ""no."" We are-we still-we think of the interest rate tool as the principal tool of monetary policy, and we think of ourselves as returning the balance sheet to a normal level over the course of the next six months. And we're not really thinking of those as two different tools of monetary policy. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, can you talk about how global developments are affecting the U.S.? What's the cause of the weakness over there? How much is it responsible for the downgrade in GDP over here? And what impact are tariffs, both in the United States and retaliatory tariffs, having on both the U.S. and the global economies? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So the global economy was a tailwind for the United States in 2017. That was the year of synchronized global growth. And we began 2018 expecting and hoping for more of the same. What happened instead is that the global economy started to gradually slow, and now we see a situation where the European economy has slowed substantially-and so has the Chinese economy, although the European economy more. And just as strong global growth was a tailwind, weaker global growth can be a headwind to our economy. How big is that effect? It's hard to be precise about it, but, clearly, we will feel that. It is an integrated global economy, and global financial markets are integrated as well. In terms of what's causing it, it seems to be a range of different things. In China, you have, you know, factors that are very specific to China. The main point, though, is that, I would say, the outlook-let's look at the outlook. Chinese authorities have taken many steps since the middle of last year to support economic activity, and I think the base case is that, ultimately, Chinese activity will stabilize at an attractive level. And in Europe, you know, we see some weakening, but, again, we don't see-we don't see recession, and we do see positive growth still. You ask about tariffs. I would say, tariffs may be a factor in China. I don't think they're the main factor. I think the main factors are the delevering campaign that the government undertook a couple of years ago and also just the longer-term slowing to a more sustainable pace of growth that economies find as they mature. In terms of our own economy, the level of tariffs is relatively small in the size of our economy-relative to the size of our economy. We have, since the beginning of the year-and before, really-been hearing from our extensive network of business contacts a lot of concerns about tariffs, concerns about material costs on imported products, and the loss of markets and things like that, depending on which industry, so there's a fair amount of uncertainty. It's hard to say how much of an effect that's having on our economy. It's very hard to tease that apart. But I will say, it's been a prominent concern among our business contacts for some time now. JAMES PUZZANGHERA. Hi. Thank you, Chairman. I want to switch gears temporarily to Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo last week announced that its chief executive received a 5 percent pay raise last year, and this comes among continued settlements by the bank of various consumer abuse and reports that new consumer-unfriendly sales incentives are returning. Do you have concerns about Wells Fargo's efforts to fix its problems, and do you expect the asset cap to remain in place beyond this year? CHAIR POWELL. Wells Fargo. So what happened at Wells Fargo really was a remarkably widespread series of breakdowns, really, in their risk-management apparatus, which resulted in significant consumer abuses, let's say. And as it's gone on and on, it's become clear that-I think some time ago it became clear that these are deep problems that needed to be addressed in a fundamental kind of a way. So there's a lot of work to do on that. And we put in place, really, an unprecedented sanction in the form of an asset growth cap, and we will not lift that until Wells Fargo gets their arms around this, comes forward with plans, implements those plans, and we're satisfied with what they've done. And that's not where we are right now. JAMES PUZZANGHERA. Do you believe it's appropriate-do you believe it's appropriate for the CEO to be getting a pay raise in light of those conditions, in terms of corporate governance? CHAIR POWELL. You know, our main supervisory focus is on the company fixing its risk-management approach and fundamentally rebuilding that approach. We don't approve individual pay packages. We do supervise boards of directors for, you know, for having a set of compensation practices that don't reward short-term risk-taking and that sort of thing. And we will supervise based on that. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television. I wonder if you could discuss the balance of risks. I know you said that the outlook among the Committee members is a positive one, but since the end of the meeting, the 3-month-10-year Treasury spread has fallen to 7 basis points, and now, according to fed funds futures trading, there's a 50 percent chance of a rate cut by next January. How far off are the markets? What do you think the risks actually are? CHAIR POWELL. Well, first, the data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view. I would say it this way: We see a positive outlook for this year, a favorable outlook for this year, as I mentioned. So, in our SEP projections, Committee members, participants, generally see growth of around 2 percent. They see unemployment remaining below 4 percent. They see inflation remaining close to target. And they see growth, as I said, around 2 percent. So, you know, that's a positive outlook. It's a favorable outlook. We're also very mindful-and we have been, of course, all along-of what the risks are. And you see-you mentioned some of them. You know, you see slowing global growth. You still have-there's no resolution of Brexit. There's no resolution, really, of the trade talks. These are ongoing risks. We're also carefully monitoring what's happening with U.S. growth. We called that out in our statement. You know, the limited data that we have do show a slowdown. On the other hand, as I mentioned, we see the underlying economic fundamentals for growth this year as still very positive. So that's really how we're thinking about it. JIM TANKERSLEY. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Jim Tankersley, New York Times. I'm curious, you're now a full percentage point-actually, more than a percentage point-below the White House in your projections for growth this year. By my calculations, that's the largest spread we've seen since the end of the recession between the White House and the Fed. Why, for one, do you see-do you think you see the economy so differently than they do, and do you worry at all about implications for policy from that? CHAIR POWELL. I haven't-I haven't seen their projection. I wouldn't comment on their projection. I would take it this way. You can think of growth as being composed of two things. And one is really growth in the workforce-more hours worked. And the other is productivity-it's output per hour. You can really think of growth as those two things. And I've been calling-often mentioning these days that it would be great if we had national-level policies to support higher labor force participation. The United States is now one of the lowest countries among the advanced economies, in terms of our labor force participation by prime-age workers. And that's a place where we can grow faster. If we can bring more people into the labor force and give them a chance to contribute to and benefit from our overall prosperity, that will be a great thing for the country. So I would like to see that. Productivity is much harder. It's very difficult to project productivity over long stretches of time. It's a function of evolving technology. So, I guess I would say, what is the potential growth rate? It's quite hard to know with any precision, and I just would like to see us, you know, undertake an effort to make it be as high as it can sustainably be. JIM TANKERSLEY. A quick follow-up on that. Do you see the tax cuts-the 2017 tax cuts as having provided a large boost to labor force participation as the White House does? CHAIR POWELL. I would say so. I think it's clear that the tax and spending policies that were adopted early last year supported demand in a significant way last year. And it's also the case, I think, that they should have some supply-side effects. I think it's hard to know, it's hard to identify those with any precision, and we hope they're-we hope they're very large. You know, the idea would be that lowering corporate taxes would spur more corporate investment, which would spur more productivity, and lowering individual taxes would spur greater labor force participation. I wouldn't want to be handing-you know, assigning credit or blame for that, but I do think that the performance of labor force participation over the last, really, three or four years has been an upside surprise that most people didn't see coming, and it's extremely welcome. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. With the new dot plot today, you've gone from two rate hikes in 2019 to zero. You still have one showing for next year. The fed funds futures trading, as has been alluded to, is showing rate cuts at the end of this year. Are they-is that a possibility in your mind, given the sharp change you've made at this meeting? CHAIR POWELL. As I mentioned, the data that we're seeing are not currently sending a signal which suggests moving in either direction for me, which is really why we're being patient. We feel our policy rate is in the range of neutral. The economy is growing at about trend. Inflation is close to target. Unemployment is under 3 percent. It's a great time for us to be patient and watch and wait and see how things evolve. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. On stress testing, I wanted to ask, how do you respond to criticism that the Fed's recent move to remove the qualitative objection from CCAR makes it less transparent to the general public? And then, also, Governor Brainard dissented on that decision, and she's dissented on some other decisions as well regulatorily recently. Does it concern you, given that the Fed has traditionally been a consensus-based organization, if you keep having these decisions where, you know, a Board member is not onboard with them? CHAIR POWELL. So you mentioned the qualitative aspect of CCAR. And U.S.-the large U.S. financial institutions have made significant progress there and are now much better at the capital planning process. And for, really, some time now, for a couple of years, we've talked about moving supervision of that process-moving to a supervisory approach to that rather than having a pass/fail in the stress tests. We've been talking about that for quite a while. And I think, given the level that the banks have moved to in capital planning, we did that. It shouldn't be a big surprise-something we've been talking about doing for a couple of years. For banks that are newer to CCAR and haven't made that kind of progress, then they're still going to be part of-they're still going to have a qualitative test until they can reach similar levels of achievement. In terms of having disparate views, I-look, we try-we are very much a consensus-driven organization. We try very hard to reach consensus on things. In the end, it's very healthy to have disparate views and to state them publicly and put them on the record. It's nothing but healthy from my standpoint. We'll always be trying to reach consensus, and, you know, I'm committed to that. TREVOR HUNNICUTT. Trevor Hunnicutt from Reuters. Just-you mentioned that you have, kind of, a positive outlook as it regards the economy but also see slower growth on the household side and the business side. Given how big of a part of the U.S. economy that is, what gives you, kind of, confidence that both the slowdown we're seeing is temporary? CHAIR POWELL. So on the household side, what we saw was a very weak reading on retail sales in December and then a bounceback in the January reading. And, you know, it was a surprise, I would say, and inconsistent with a significant amount of other data. We're not dismissing it in any way, but I would go back to, what is it that supports consumer spending? It's 70 percent of the economy, as you point out. It's strong economic underlying fundamentals, so, rising wages, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, high levels of job creation, confidence. The household confidence surveys have moved back up to where they were last summer. So we look at those fundamentals, and we think that looks like a setting in which consumption will have support from underlying economic fundamentals. And that's really what we're thinking there. So, you know, we're also patiently watching and waiting and not assuming. We're not taking no signal from the incoming data; that's why we called it out in our statement. So I think our eyes are open on this. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, in 1998 the Fed eased policy in a way that some say may have avoided a recession, others say may have helped fuel the NASDAQ tech stock bubble. And financial conditions have eased considerably this year since the policy pivot that you made clear in January. The S&P, for example, is just 3 percent below last summer's peak. And so, I wonder, does this episode from 20 years ago bear at all on your thinking today about the risks posed by rising asset values in an environment of a shallower policy path? CHAIR POWELL. We're in a very different world today and post-crisis, because we now very carefully monitor financial conditions and financial stability concerns on an ongoing basis, and we publish a report twice a year, and we have quarterly Board meetings and briefings where we look deeply into these things. So this is something we have very much on our radar screen. And I would say, overall, we don't see financial stability vulnerabilities as high. There are some aspects of the financial markets that we're carefully monitoring, and those are in the nature of things that might be amplifiers to a downturn-as opposed to a financial stability concern, which might lead to a financial crisis and that kind of thing, which we don't see. So we do monitor that. And I would also say, you know, that the whole question of monetary policy and financial stability is an unsettled and difficult one in our world. We do think that the principal tools for, you know, for managing financial stability are regulation, supervision, macroprudential tools, and those sorts of things as opposed to changing the interest rate. But we're certainly very mindful of financial conditions and those risks. NICK TIMIRAOS. If I could ask a follow-up-if it's the case that we're in a lower neutral interest rate world where you could have more asset price appreciation, do you think the Fed needs more macroprudential tools so that it doesn't have to lean on monetary policy to do so much? CHAIR POWELL. It's a very difficult question with a long answer. We-in our system, we mainly rely on ""through the cycle"" tools like high capital and stress tests. Our financial stability system is built on those tools: high capital, high liquidity, resolution planning, stress testing. So those are always on. We also have some tools, like the countercyclical capital buffer, which we can deploy at times when vulnerabilities are meaningfully above normal. But we do rely on those tools. And I would say, our banks are well capitalized. They're far better capitalized and better aware of their risks and more liquid than they were before the financial crisis. So they'll be more resilient in, you know, in difficult states of the economy. DONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Included in the President's fiscal 2020 budget is a new estimate that the nation's debt will balloon to more than $31 trillion over the next decade, by 2029. You've previously said that the country is on an unsustainable fiscal path. How alarming is that number to you? And, while the United States might not be quite there yet, when do you begin to worry about a possible credit crisis? CHAIR POWELL. I do think that deficits matter, and I do think-I think it's not really controversial to say that our debt can't grow faster than our economy indefinitely and that's what it's doing now. So this is something we will have to deal with, and I think we can't really lose sight of that, and I'd like to see a greater focus on that over time. It's not in the nature of a near-term debt crisis or anything like that, and I wouldn't want to try to predict when that would happen, but it is something that it's important that the public discussion really come back to, if I can say that. And we will have to deal with it eventually. JAMES POLITI. James Politi of the Financial Times. There's huge uncertainty at the moment over the fate of the Brexit negotiations. How much of a factor has this been for the Fed in turning towards a kind of patient approach to monetary policy, and what's your base case on that? And on the size of the balance sheet, what's your-do you have a numerical estimate for where it will be at the end of September once the runoff is complete? CHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we're watching Brexit carefully and hoping that it can be resolved in an orderly way. From our standpoint, the part of it that we can control is that we've been involved with supervising our financial institutions that are active either in the United Kingdom or the European Union or both to make sure that they're ready for the full range of possible outcomes to the-to Brexit. So-and in doing so, we've also had-we've also worked alongside regulators from the United Kingdom and the EU. So we do, again, hope that that can be resolved well, but we know that our banks are well capitalized and resilient to different kinds of events. In terms of the size of the balance sheet, the balance sheet will be of a size of approximately 17 percent of GDP around the end of this year, down from 25 percent of GDP at the end of 2014-so, significantly smaller relative to GDP than it was. I'm guessing you're looking for a dollar number, though, probably, and that would be-so, for the size of the balance sheet, it looks like it'll be a bit above $3.5 trillion then. GREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chairman Powell, could you talk through your outlook for inflation this year? Aren't-you're not concerned about it? And rising-why aren't rising wages feeding into inflation? CHAIR POWELL. Let me take wages first, if I can. So wages have moved up in the last couple of years and are now running at healthier, higher levels, and that's a good thing. In fact, a lot of the wage gains have been going to lower-paid workers, as can happen late in the cycle, which is also a good thing. So-but that's not price inflation, that's wage inflation. Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation. So what I see is inflation that's close to 2 percent but that sort of keeps bumping up against 2 percent and then maybe moving back down a little bit. And I don't feel that we have kind of convincingly achieved our 2 percent mandate in a symmetrical way. Now, what do we mean by ""symmetrical""? What we really mean is that we would look at-we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target. So that's really our framework. And I don't think we've quite achieved that yet, because we're really 10 years deep in this-almost 10 years-in this expansion, and inflation is still kind of, I'd say, not, you know, clearly meeting our target. So that's one of the reasons why we're being patient. I think, as I've said before, I think inflation that is a little bit below our target-particularly headline inflation this year will be, you know, meaningfully below our target for most of the year because of lower oil prices, but we project that core will be too-that gives us the ability to be patient and not move until we see that our target goals are being achieved. GREG ROBB. I just wanted to press a little bit about, what is the story the Committee-you know, when you get in the discussion today and yesterday about inflation, what kind of is the story that emerges? CHAIR POWELL. So there are a bunch of different stories. There's no real easy answer. One of them is just that the natural rate of unemployment is lower than people think. That's one way to think about it, that there's still more slack in the economy. Another is that expectations play a very-inflation expectations play a very key role in our framework and other frameworks, and, you know, there is the possibility that some people discuss of expectations being anchored but below 2 percent. And so, either way, inflation itself has kind of bounced around a little below 2 percent. That's the record. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for the question. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. I'm just kind of curious-I mean, this below-target inflation is a global phenomenon, at least across advanced economies, and I'd just like to kind of hear your thoughts about what kind of challenges that poses to policymakers like yourself and the global economy in general. Yes, thanks. CHAIR POWELL. It's a major challenge. It's one of the major challenges of our time, really, to have inflation-you know, downward pressure on inflation, let's say. It gives central banks less room to, you know, to respond to downturns, right? So if inflation expectations are below 2 percent, they're always going to be pulling inflation down, and we're going to be paddling upstream in trying to, you know, keep inflation at 2 percent, which gives us some room to cut, you know, when it's time to cut rates when the economy weakens. And, you know, that's something that central banks face all over the world, and we certainly face that problem too. It's one of the-one of the things we're looking into as part of our strategic monetary policy review this year. The proximity to the zero lower bound calls for more creative thinking about ways we can, you know, uphold the credibility of our inflation target, and, you know, we're open minded about ways we can do that. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. So I counted five downgrades in the first paragraph of the FOMC statement. What conditions do you need to see in order for a rate cut or a rate hike on the other side of that then? CHAIR POWELL. Well, we-I think we were-we wanted to be careful to go ahead and acknowledge the things. I think it's relatively little hard data so far this year, but we were careful to point out lower retail sales-the weak November meeting-BFI, all those things, and I think that was the right thing to do. Notwithstanding that, we do have a positive outlook for the year for the reasons I mentioned-you know, solid underlying economic fundamentals, et cetera. So, and in terms of what it would take, I'd say, again, today we don't see any-we don't see data coming in that suggests that we should move in either direction. They suggest that we should remain patient and let the situation clarify itself over time. When the time comes, we'll act appropriately. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi. Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg. Fed Vice Chairman Rich Clarida has talked about how the decline in labor's share of income and the corresponding high profit margins might mean that lower unemployment and higher wage growth is not flowing through to price inflation the way it used to. But, so far throughout this tightening cycle, the Fed has not allowed wage growth to rise above longer-term interest rates until just very recently. So I'm wondering if, going forward, given these insights about the labor share and high profit margins and the linkage between wages and prices, would you be in favor of allowing wage growth to continue accelerating without matching that with higher interest rates? CHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say that we've had, you know, a significant move up in wages and compensation over the last few years, and I-which does not trouble me from the standpoint of inflation. We've had-also had-in other cycles, we've had situations where, you know, unit labor costs were moving up above inflation, and that didn't lead to price inflation. It does-you know, in theory, it can squeeze corporate margins, and, you know, that can't go on indefinitely. But, nonetheless, I don't see the current wage picture as concerning from an inflation standpoint. MATTHEW BOESLER. More generally, to the extent that wage growth in excess of interest rates allows households to pay down debt faster, whereas interest rates in excess of wage growth risks a further buildup in debt, how do you account for the sort of financial stability consequences of varying interest rates relative to wage growth? CHAIR POWELL. I don't think we look at-I understand what you're asking, but we're looking at-our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that's what we're looking at with setting interest rates. And we also monitor financial stability very carefully across all meaningful asset categories. I don't think we tie it particularly to the relationship you're talking about. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Just a quick follow-up on Brexit. You mentioned that you're making sure that U.S. financial institutions are ready for whatever outcome. I'm wondering, can you be a little more specific about that? And also, how are you preparing for any pressures that a hard Brexit would put on the U.S. dollar? CHAIR POWELL. Well, as I mentioned, you know, with the stress tests that the largest financial institutions-and those are the ones that tend to be active internationally-that they undergo every year, we put them through very large financial shocks with large losses and big changes in markets every year. And we vary that every year. So that's a pretty good-you know, having done that for a number of years now, that's-and having them be required to have adequate capital and liquidity even after all that happens. So that's a good thing to have done, knowing that you're going into something that's quite unknown, which may prove stressful, it may not prove stressful, depending on what the outcome is. So I think all that has probably prepared our institutions well. That said, nothing like this has happened in recent years, and so it's really hard to be confident. So we're very watchful about what's going on. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And as far as the dollar goes? CHAIR POWELL. So we don't-you know, we-the dollar is really the business of the Treasury Department. It's certainly a financial condition unto itself that plays into our models, but we don't, you know, seek or model or attempt to affect the dollar directly with our policies. JOHN HELTMAN. Hi. John Heltman-John Heltman with American Banker. I have a question about the Fed's proposal from October of last year regarding enhanced prudential standards for banks above $250 billion. Some analysts have suggested that that proposal could encourage consolidation mergers and acquisition among banks, particularly at the upper end of the range. I'm curious if the Fed anticipated that outcome and whether you have any reservations or whether you-the Fed cares about bank consolidation more generally. CHAIR POWELL. We're not motivated by a particular view of industry structure that we're trying to achieve through our regulation. I think we want to have banks of all different sizes and with different business models out there carrying out their functions in the economy. So that's how we think about that. I would also say, when banks merge and move into a larger asset category, they get stronger regulation, not weaker regulation. So if you think about it, you know, if you're a medium-sized bank and you merge with another medium-sized bank, you wind up being more than a medium-sized bank, you know. But the sense of our tapering is that-""tailoring,"" sorry-our tailoring policy is that the highest expectations fall upon the largest, most systemically important, most complex institutions, and then at every step along the way, the expectations become more tailored to the risks that that institution actually presents to the economy. So- BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. Thanks for taking my question. So as the Fed remains on pause, does the central bank find the onus on fiscal policy to extend its economic recovery and fend off a slowdown-as in, is the Fed positioning itself to take on a reactionary role to whatever fiscal policy is doing? I'm asking because we're seeing the waning effect of tax reform and no material news on infrastructure, so just wondering kind of how you feel the monetary policy-fiscal policy balance is in swing right now. CHAIR POWELL. So we take-we take fiscal policy as, you know, as exogenous to what we do. You know, in other words, whatever happens with fiscal policy, we take that. We don't evaluate it, we don't criticize it, and we don't overreact to it either. So I think it's just a fact. It's just an external fact about the economy for us. I mean, our policy is-the reason we're on hold is that we think our policy rate is in a good place, and we think the economy is in a good place, and we're watching carefully as we see these events evolve around the world and at home, and we think that's what we need to be doing. STEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner, freelance journalist reporting for NPR, Mr. Chairman. The Fed has been allowing the average maturity of securities in its bond portfolio to lengthen. Is this aimed at-consciously aimed at flattening the yield curve, and is that going to be part of the Fed's longer-run balance sheet strategy? And if flattening the yield curve is a conscious long-term strategy, are you concerned about the side effect of the heightening concerns about a flatter or inverted yield curve being a harbinger of recession? CHAIR POWELL. The basic answer to your question is ""no."" We are-the decision about the maturity composition of the Fed's balance sheet in the longer run lies ahead of us. We have not made that decision, and we're-we really haven't begun to have a serious series of discussions over a series of meetings to grapple with that. That, I think, will be something we turn to reasonably soon, but I think it will take some time. It's a consequential decision and one that needs some thought. We've had a lot of balance sheet discussions, as I mentioned, over the last four meetings, but this is the next big one that-big decision that we'll face. And, you know, I think we're not going to be in a rush to resolve it, but we'll turn to it soon. STEVEN BECKNER. Can I just follow up, please? Well, how do you account for the fact that the average maturity has in fact been lengthening and contributing to a flattening of the yield curve? Is that-what's-what's causing that? CHAIR POWELL. I think, isn't it just that as securities roll off, you wind up investing in-you know, as a 10-year rolls off, you wind up investing in a 10-year, and automatically that lengthens things. It's not at all a plan to lengthen the balance sheet. It's just been-we try to have a practice that we don't deviate from, and it's transparent, and-no policy message in that. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask, at what point do you expect to begin to allow the balance sheet to grow slowly again? What are-how will you make that decision? CHAIR POWELL. So, as I-as I mentioned, the balance sheet runoff will stop at about-at September 30. And if it is our view at that time that we're still a ways away from-a ways above a balance sheet that is what we need to efficiently and effectively conduct monetary policy, at that time we will hold the balance sheet constant. And then what'll happen is, organically, very gradually, currency and other nonreserved liabilities will grow, and reserves will shrink. And the question you're asking is, how long will that go on? The truth is, we don't know, and we don't really know that we'll move past September 30th. The level of reserve demand is something that we've put a lot of effort and time into creating estimates, based on market intelligence and surveys and that kind of thing. The truth is, we don't know. It may evolve over time. So we'll just have to see. I wouldn't want to put a time out there for that, but-so I'll just leave it there. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Are you concerned at all what the market impact will be should the Fed resume policy tightening somewhere down the line? As I'm sure you know, the market listens to you very, very closely. CHAIR POWELL. You know, I'm just going to say that I think we're in a good place right now, which is, we're being patient, we're watching, we don't see any data pushing us to move rates in either direction, and we're going to watch carefully and patiently as we allow events to evolve. And when they do clarify, we will act appropriately."

"STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Liesman, CNBC. As the statement noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent-it's been falling for three straight months, and while you've been close, it's only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012. Mr. Chair, I guess I wonder, is it time to address low inflation through policy, and can you give us some sense of your metric for when it would be time? At what level would it require a policy response from the Committee? CHAIR POWELL. So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis. As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don't see a strong case for moving in either direction. I would point out that inflation actually ran-including core inflation-actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018. As you point out, both headline and core, though, did come in on the soft side in the first quarter, and that was not expected as it relates to core. So we say in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent. So ""persistent"" carries the sense of something that's not transient, something that will sustain over a period of time. And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient. And I'd point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things. In addition, the trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much. Indeed, the Dallas trimmed mean is at 2 percent. But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent-inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy. SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Let me carry on on the same theme. There's obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the prospects for a rate reduction this year. Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of themselves on this? And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious consideration of a rate cut? The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example-do you actually need to see a looming recession to cut rates, or could an insurance cut be appropriate? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So as I mentioned, we've just come through a two-day meeting, and we've done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. We don't see a strong case for moving in either direction. So- we do, of course, though-as a routine matter, as you well know-we look not only at our baseline, but we also look at alternative simulations, both better and worse, and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy response would be. But that's all we do. And I would just say that we're comfortable-the Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Shifting gears a little bit, I wondered if you could flesh out-I know you're describing it as a small technical adjustment, but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or not this breaches the upper limit a little bit. Is there any feed-through to broader credit conditions and financial conditions that you worry about, or is it simply a matter of the Fed showing that it can control what it says it's controlling? And I do have a follow-up. CHAIR POWELL. So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really carry no-wouldn't be important, as your question suggests. But we do think it's important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range. That's just good monetary policy, good monetary control. So we think it's important, and we have the tools to do that, so we've used them again today. And, again, this is just a technical fix. It really has no implications for policy. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. But as a follow-up on this, it is demonstrating that you can control the market you want to control. And I guess the question is, at what point would these steady declines in the IOER-steady widening of this spread, if it continues, essentially become the policy choice? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, I mean-so, generally speaking, the federal funds rate-we control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate. And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates-money market rates-has been very good over a long period of time. And that's important, because it's really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate. So I think the Fed controlling the federal funds rate is actually important from that standpoint, and I don't see us not controlling it. So I think we'll continue to control it, and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial conditions. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg. I'm curious about the financial conditions that you see out there. The minutes of the March meeting tell us ""a few"" officials worried about financial stability risks. Was there a broader discussion at this meeting? Any consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit new highs, and we do see some instability in short-end trading-is it possible that rates are too low at this point? CHAIR POWELL. We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting. So we had our quarterly briefing today-yesterday, as a matter of fact-and had that discussion as well. And I think there haven't been a lot of changes since the last meeting, but I'll just go through the way we think about it. First, we've developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities-put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public. And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent. So there are four aspects of it that I'll go through quickly, but I'd say that the headline really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance. And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity. But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices. And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so. Leverage in the financial sector-I mentioned households are actually in good shape from a leverage standpoint. Default rates are low. Borrowing is relatively low. Nonfinancial corporates is an area that we've spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns about that-not so much from a financial stability standpoint, but from the standpoint that having a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn. And then the last two-the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United States. So, on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up on that-I'm just curious as to whether the level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates. CHAIR POWELL. So we do say that risks to the financial system-we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration. I would say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns are better-capital liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that. Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, with the benefit of hindsight, did last year's rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact, a ceiling? And, if so, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation remained persistently closer to 1Â½ percent instead of 2 percent? And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates, given the recent softness in core inflation? CHAIR POWELL. So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there. And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong. The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way. And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent. The weak first quarter performance was not expected-of core was not expected, and I don't think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates. It appears to be more-we don't know this, but you never know until-with hindsight, with perfect hindsight, but some of it does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic. Now, the second part of your question? Sorry. NICK TIMIRAOS. Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower rates if core inflation held closer to 1Â½ percent? And, if not, are you worried that there is unwanted tightening from real rates, being where they are? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, I mean-so, as I said earlier, we do address this in our, sort of, constitutional document. If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy. I do think it's important that inflation run close to and sustainably -for a sustained period of time-and symmetrically around 2 percent. Because if it doesn't, you run the risk that inflation expectations can-it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside-inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. So as you just mentioned, last year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus. And you still have that to some extent, although the tax cuts have mostly feeded through-we've still got something in the pipeline from the spending cap increases. So, I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward the end of this year? CHAIR POWELL. Inflation, first of all-month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter-is going to move around. There will always be factors hitting it. So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation expectations are anchored-the thought being, that's where inflation will go in the long run if it's not been pushed by those other factors. So we also think that slack-the level of slack in the economy does play some small role. It's actually still a measurable role. It's nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that's also something that plays a role. And so we take all those things into account, and the part of it that we can control is the slack part. And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move back up. And if it isn't and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then that's something we'd take into account in setting policy. DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. Pivoting a little bit-about wages, since 2010, women's real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to men's, which have risen about 2.1. Do you think the relative increase in women's wages is a problem for the U.S. economy? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think, generally, I'd have to see the data on that. It sounds like you picked a particular time frame. Over time, I really wonder whether that's the case. You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large. So- DONNA BORAK. Just to push a little bit on this. But if the data shows that women's wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U.S. economy if male's wages are declining or not growing as fast as women's? CHAIR POWELL. So I think we're getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly, and that's something I'd rather avoid. It's really not my role to engage with potential nominees to the Fed, so I'm really not going to go there. I haven't seen this research either, so I don't really-really know. Thanks. VICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask-early last month, I believe it was April 2, the FedwireÂ® system went down. And I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether you're still looking into it, and whether it's something that could happen again. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So that's right. I want to say it was April 1, but it may have been April 2. In any case, the FedwireÂ® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour range. We were able to quickly identify the problem: It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves. So, you know, we learn from these instances. They're fairly rare, but we learn from them, and in this case it was internal, and it's been corrected. STEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Next month, we have the 10th anniversary of the end of the recession, and there are some countries that have had expansions for 15, 20, 25 years. Do you think that's something that's practical for the U.S., that we could have that kind of lengthy expansion? And for you personally, if we had a recession during your tenure, would you consider that a failure? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I wouldn't want to speculate. There's always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they're in year 28 of their expansion. So things are possible. All I can see is that we have an economy where the expansion is continuing. Growth is at a healthy level. The labor market is strong. We see job creation. We see wages moving up. Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent. So I see us on a good path for this year. STEVE MATTHEWS. Do you see parallels with the 1990s, when-for example, some people have pointed out, in the U.S., the longest expansion before this one, there was a rate cut in 1995, and rates went up, and then they came down, and there was that kind of management. Do you see similarities in today's situation? CHAIR POWELL. Similarities in the length. I mean, the situations were quite different then. This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it's very interesting to look at the history. I find it quite interesting to look at different periods. But I think, in our own cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really what's relevant for us now. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You've repeatedly said that the Fed's going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside political pressure, but it seems like the President is intent on increasing that political pressure. Yesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing. What do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey your decisions to the public? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that means we don't think about short-term political considerations, we don't discuss them, and we don't consider them in making our decisions one way or the other. And what we're always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent. So to give you an idea of what our process is like, maybe as a way of putting all that in context-so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive preparations: catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues and their staff. As you also are I'm sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector just to get a better sense of the economy. We put all that together, and we come together for two days. The first day begins with an economic briefing, which is, sort of, economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world. That takes up most of the first day, and we talk about this in great detail. We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the next day we talk about monetary policy. And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is. And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we're going to be patient as we consider adjustments. And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent with that outlook. So we don't feel like the data's pushing us in either direction. Of course, we'll not hesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction. But that's our process. That's how we think about things. We don't think about other factors. We don't let them into our decisionmaking. We don't discuss them. PAUL KIERNAN. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thanks for the question. In the last 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that coincided with the housing bubble. I'd like to know what you would say to people who worry that it will prove difficult for the Fed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset bubble of some sort. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So you're pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below. And that includes us, although we've actually done-we've come closer, I think, than most others. And it's just a question, I think, of demographic and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it creates significant challenges. One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower-will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest rates. And that's one of the reasons we're having a review of our monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications this year-to think about that problem. You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower-for-longer rates, and that is another challenge. As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do right through the cycle-those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen. GREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. This morning, the ISM manufacturing index fell to have its worst reading since October 2016. So isn't that a dark cloud on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year? I mean, how much weight does it hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight? CHAIR POWELL. This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on manufacturing. Yes, we see that reading as-it's still a positive reading and consistent with what we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth. Manufacturing has been weak all around the world. Services have been growing faster. So it's-yes, it's something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution to growth from the manufacturing sector. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for doing this. You mentioned-talked about domestic growth a little bit with the economy. You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress. Could you talk about a little bit of the domestic growth that you're seeing going forward for the rest of the year? And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy? CHAIR POWELL. Our outlook and my outlook is for-is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year. And I would say that the basis for that, really, is consumer spending and business investment. So if you look at consumer spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March. And, as I mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of consumer spending-that's more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, high levels of employment, wages going up. All those things are going to support consumer spending. So that's a significant part of the outlook this year. And business investment should also be positive in that sort of direction. In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty around these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment. We have been hearing from our business contacts, really, a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern. If you import metals or whatever for your product or export your product, then it's been a challenge for you. So that would be a positive. And, of course, most of the gains, though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time. You know, I don't think-it wouldn't be the kind of thing where you'd immediately feel big effects right away, but they could be quite important over a longer period. So that, I think-that would be my expectation. I don't know, though. I haven't seen-none of us, at least I haven't seen, the details of what's been negotiated. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. Getting back to inflation, can you talk more about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think those factors will pass? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. Well, I would just mention a couple. Let me say, I don't mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there's good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors. One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag. And so when asset prices went back up, probably there'll be a swing around there, a positive contribution. Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low. There was a change in the methodology. And another one is airfares. There are many little things. So we don't know until, again, until we see, but there's reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around. And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways, like-not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned. So trimmed mean-it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn't go down at all. It's at 2 percent-or it's at, I don't know whether it went down or was above that, but it's at 2 percent now. So there's reason to think that these will be transient. We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case. I would point to the case of cell phone services. Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a very low reading for cell phone services-mobile phone services-and it was kind of a price war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated. And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we had those months of 2 percent inflation. So, again, we'll have to see here. We're going to be watching-really, I'd like to say we're going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I'll end by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Just following up, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. You were saying if inflation does stay low and these low inflation rates are not transient, you said a couple times you'll take that into account with monetary policy. How, specifically, will you take that into account? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, it's hard to say, because there's so many other variables. Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time, but that's part of our mandate. Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we've defined that as 2 percent. So we would be concerned, and we'd take it into account. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So a cut in interest rates would be possible? CHAIR POWELL. I can't really be any more specific than what I've said. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market News. If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do you see room for another IOER adjustment? And then, can you speak to any other strategies or tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short-term interest rates? There have been other ideas floated, like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate. CHAIR POWELL. If we need to, and as needed, we will use our tools to keep the federal funds rate somewhere in the target range. We'll do that. Don't expect to need to do it again, but we don't know. I mean, we're-with-the balance sheet is now-the size of it is going to be driven by demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned. And we're right at that point where we're starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next few months. And so I-there is no template for this. There's no roadmap. We just have to do it, and that's why we're moving so very gradually. It's why we tapered the roll-off to only $15 billion in Treasuries per month. Effective, I guess, today, we're cutting the roll-off rate for Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here. So that's that. In terms of other tools, we're actually-I'm sure at an upcoming meeting we will be looking at the idea of a repo facility. I don't have any presupposition that it's something we would do, but we'll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox. Again, I wouldn't say-it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then go away and think about it for a little while. And then probably come back and make a decision. But that's something we'll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine. HANNAH LANG. Hannah Lang, American Banker. On the regulatory side, the Fed and other bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling a proposal to revise the Volcker rule. Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution and what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or making changes to the original proposal? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we got a lot of comments, and we're reviewing them carefully. I really don't have a lot for you. I know they're making good progress. I don't really have a date though. And in terms of what all it's going to be, it's not something I can say with any certainty yet. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. So given what you've said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I'm wondering if you think that continued growth in economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another overheating. For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 was 2.1, so I'm just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see strong GDP numbers. CHAIR POWELL. Well, we don't see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing. We see inflation below 2 percent now-as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last year. So, really, no signs of overheating. If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing. Nonetheless, you have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all. It's not higher than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity. So, really not seeing signs of overheating at the moment. HEATHER LONG. Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle? Can you kind of give us a read on-but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the Committee views productivity growth, if it's accelerating enough? CHAIR POWELL. Yes-in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now-wages and benefits are now between 3 and 3Â½ percent. Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing. You mentioned productivity. So productivity is really very difficult to predict. No one has been able to predict it successfully, so I won't really try. But I will say this: Productivity was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years. Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher. I don't know if that level can be sustained, but we really-it's driven, to some extent, by technological developments and, really, the diffusion of technology through the economy, and it's very hard to predict. So I think it's positive. In fact, I'll mention, if we're talking about the supply side, labor force participation. Really, there has been a significant positive supply-side development over the last year and a half between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also productivity. And that does suggest more room to grow. It suggests that a less tight economy, a less, you know-may be part of the explanation for lower inflation. Thanks very much.

"NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, did you consider a rate cut today? Specifically, was it one of the options-the policy options in the Tealbook? And is the Committee considering moving, given all the uncertainty you addressed, moving its-changing its policy before the next meeting? CHAIR POWELL. So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial conditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy. And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we're going to be monitoring-monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we've mentioned, but that we'd like to see more going forward. Particularly, we'd like to see whether these risks continue to weigh on the outlook. So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case-eight of those, a strengthened case for cutting rates. Eight actually wrote down rate cuts. A number of others see that the case has strengthened. But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned. And I also mentioned that some of these-some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage. And so we do expect that we'll be learning a lot more on all of these issues in the near term. And that's our focus. NICK TIMIRAOS. Do you think something could change before the next meeting? CHAIR POWELL. I'm sure that things will change before the next meeting. I expect a full range of data and information on all of these issues that we are looking at. I think we'll learn a great deal more about them. And I think that's-we think that that's the right way to move here. Again, many of these developments happened, you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period. Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy, and our policy, was in a good place. So we want to see-we want to see and we want to react to developments and trends that are sustained, that are genuine, and not react just to data points or just to changes in sentiment, which can be volatile. At the same time, we are-we're quite mindful of the risks to the outlook and are prepared to move and use our tools as needed to sustain the expansion. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman, CNBC. Could you walk us through your thinking about trade? It was really the threat of tariffs against Mexico that caused at least the market to become definitively banking, or-pricing in rate cuts. If, for example, there's a deal with China, does that take the possibility of rate cuts off the table? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so I would say that we're not looking at any one thing. I guess I would start by agreeing with your premise that news about trade has been an important driver of sentiment in the intermeeting period. But we're also looking at global growth. It's really trade developments and concerns about global growth that are on our minds. So we're not exclusively focused on one event or one piece of data. Risks seem to have grown. In the meantime, we have incoming data in the United States that's been pretty good, particularly for the consumer: Consumer spending is solid supported by, you know, a healthy job market, high levels of employment, wages going up. We do see, though, some areas that we're looking at, such as, I mentioned, business fixed income.2 So-also, the prolonged shortfall in inflation and perhaps job growth-we don't like to look at one job report. We like to average over three or six months, but still that bears watching. 2 Chair Powell intended to say ""business fixed investment."" So we'll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook. We expect to learn a good deal more, as I mentioned. And we'll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook. And then, in the end, we'll use our tools as appropriate to sustain this long expansion. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. Could you clarify what you would do if the President tweets or calls you to say he would like to demote you as Fed Chair? CHAIR POWELL. I think the law is clear that I have a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. I was hoping that-this is Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. I was hoping that you could clarify for us a little bit how you're thinking about the risks of waiting too long to cut rates versus the risks of cutting rates prematurely-sort of, what the balance of risks are and how you talk about that. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So we're always trying to balance that risk, but I would say that, given the quite recent nature of some of the events, I think the Committee felt, though, that the right thing to do was to wait and see more. And we will see a lot more on all of these issues in the very near term. So I don't think the risk of waiting too long is prominent right now. I would say, as a general matter, it's always something that we have to weigh. But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook. JEANNA SMIALEK. [Inaudible] CHAIR POWELL. Obviously, we try to avoid going prematurely as well. In this case, you know, there's always some judgment in these things. But I would just say that the risks that we see having emerged are risks that have gotten our attention and that have called a number of us to write down rate cuts, and a number of those who haven't to see that the case has strengthened. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You had your first dissent in your time as Chairman. Does that give us a sense that there was debate among a group that was pushing for a rate cut this time? And how do you-do you expect further dissents going forward? CHAIR POWELL. Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time, before there had been any dissents, and that is that I think the process of careful, thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I've always believed that. And I feel like you make better decisions when you hear a disparity of views. So I really do look at it that way. I would add, though, that the support for the path we took for the policy statement that we adopted was quite broad. JAMES POLITI. James Politi with the Financial Times. Mario Draghi at the ECB yesterday sent a strong signal of new stimulus for the euro zone. Do you think that such actions to ease policy at other central banks around the world will put more pressure on the Fed to do the same? CHAIR POWELL. Well, first, I think all central banks are focused on their domestic-their mandates are domestic, and they're focused on economic conditions from a domestic standpoint. And that goes for the European Central Bank, it goes for the Fed, it goes for all central banks. So that's our principal focus. So it could cut either way. You know, I would think that, to the extent you see stronger financial conditions and stronger activity in the ECB after a rate cut, that would support-tend to support activity.3 So we're really focused on, you know, the risks to our-on the baseline outlook, which is still a pretty favorable one, and the risks to those outlooks. That's our principal focus. 3 Chair Powell intended to say ""stronger activity in the euro area."" HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks. This is the first time that you've been really issuing SEPs in an era when rates are going to be going down. Just two sort of related questions: Is there concern that you'll be causing a sort of ""dot deflation"" by telling people, ""Well, don't buy your car now, because it'll get cheaper in six months because we're cutting rates,"" and that that could sort of fulfill itself? And, secondly, on inflation, that was a pretty big drop in expected PCE, yet, you know, without reacting to it, are you not sort of undermining your own credibility in terms of commitment to the 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL. I'll take the inflation one first. I didn't quite follow your ""dot"" question. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, the fact that expected inflation went from 1.8 to-Howard Schneider with Reuters-went from 1.8 to 1.5, it's the fact that you're not responding to that. CHAIR POWELL. That's the inflation question. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Yes. CHAIR POWELL. I'm saying you- HOWARD SCHNEIDER. On def-no, the fact that you've signaled rate cuts are coming. Or is-was there any concern on the Committee that this would tell consumers, tell people, ""Don't borrow now, don't spend now, because rates will get cheaper later""? CHAIR POWELL. I see. Okay, right. Okay. So let me let me answer the inflation question first. So we're saying that we know-I noted in the statement and also in my-what I said here. We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped. We noted that also in the statement. And I noted it as a reason for us to-one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened. So we find that notable. Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants, dropped a couple of tenths. So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation. Let me say, on inflation, it's something I've been concerned about for quite a long time. It's one of the principal reasons why I called for the review. In a world where policy rates are going to be closer to the effective lower bound, then, just as a general matter, we need to be really strong on 2 percent inflation. So I think, you know, we certainly don't want to be seen as weak on inflation, and I don't believe we are. In terms of the dots, you're right, this is the first time, I believe, we've had-we've talked about cutting in the ""dot era."" I guess the dot era began in January 2012. And, you know, we're working our way through it. And I think it's just something we do. You know that my view on the dots is that they, overall, provide useful information for people, but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not. Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they're not discussed or debated at the meeting, they're an input to policy more than an output of policy, and they're also only the most likely case. So, in a situation where there's relatively high uncertainty, there's the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely. But that doesn't show up in the dot. The dot is either one thing or it's another. So I just would say that, if you pay too close attention to the dots, then you may lose sight of the larger picture. CHRISTOPHER CONDON. Thank you. Chris Condon, Bloomberg News. Mr. Chairman, if and when the Committee decides to cut rates, I suspect there'll be a debate over whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points. Indeed, there's a pretty substantial body of academic literature arguing that a central bank close to the zero lower bound ought to act sooner and more aggressively than it otherwise would. I'm wondering what you think of that prescription, and if you could spend a couple of minutes discussing the pros and cons of the 50 basis point cut and how you approach that question. CHAIR POWELL. On the specific question of that, that's just something we haven't really engaged with yet, and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk picture as we move forward. So it would be-so nothing I can say about that is specific to the near-term question that we face. More generally, though, the research you refer to essentially notes that, in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, it's why-research kind of shows this-it's wise to react, for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening. In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era. I don't know-and it's always in the-I think it's in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it's well understood to be correct. Again, I don't know what that means in terms of the size of a particular rate cut going forward. That's going to depend heavily upon, you know, the actual data and the evolving risk picture. DONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Thanks, Chairman Powell. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has provided a proposal to revalue the U.S. dollar in order to address concerns about rising trade deficits. The President himself has routinely complained about the strength of the U.S. dollar, saying it has resulted in, quote, ""tremendous,"" close quote, competitive advantage with countries like China and others. Do you think that an overvalued dollar has been a drag on America's global competitiveness? And would you support an intervention of some kind on this issue? CHAIR POWELL. The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy, not the Fed, and we don't comment, in that sense, on the level of the dollar. We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use our tools to achieve that. Of course, we do that through changing financial conditions, and one of those is the dollar, but we don't target the dollar. It's just something that we don't do. In fact, central banks-or, rather, nations, when they get together, routinely adopt a communique that says we will target our domestic, economic, and financial conditions and not our exchange rate in using monetary policy, and that includes the United States, that includes the G-20 communique that we adopted 10 days ago. So I'm not the right person to ask about that sort of dollar policy intervention. PAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones. If the most-according to the dot plot, I mean-if the most likely case is that you will have to cut rates in the next 18 months and given some of the concerns about, you know, policy needing to react sooner and more aggressively, what would have been the downsides to cutting rates now? Why not just cut them now? CHAIR POWELL. So, why not now? And, I would say, there was not much support for cutting rates now at this meeting. There was, as you see, a number of people wrote down rate cuts. But all of those, but apparently one, felt that it would be better to see more to-before moving. And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case. First, it's just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they'll sustain. So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would, in fact, learn a lot about these developments in the near term. Ultimately, the question we're going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook? And we will act as needed, including promptly, if that's appropriate, and use our tools to expand-to sustain the expansion. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. Thank you for doing this, Chairman. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. How do you reconcile the conflicting economic data coming in? You know, on one hand, you have strong overall growth. Consumer spending is strong. On the other hand, manufacturing numbers were a little bit weaker, you have growth in jobs but coming in a little weaker, and then you have low inflation. And then, specifically, what data are you looking at that you decided not to have a rate cut? Why didn't you do that? [0:24:15.5] CHAIR POWELL. Well, you gave a pretty good picture. I mean, it's a complicated picture, and, you know, the answer is, we look at all of it. But I would say, the big pieces of it are this: The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter. That is coming true. And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense. You've got a tight labor market. You've got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce. You've got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful. You've got wages going up. You've got high levels of household confidence. So, all of that, underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy, which is 70 percent of the economy, is quite solid. Job creation, if you take a three-month average, is still well above, you know, the entry-level of entry into the workforce. So that part of the economy is solid. You mentioned manufacturing, and we're seeing this all around the world. Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker. It's not solely a domestic issue, and it may be that there are a range of factors that are contributing to that, including, for example, what China has done over the last couple of years in working to bring down its leverage. Some of it may be uncertainty over your supply chains due to trade developments. The Boeing 737 issues may be contributing in their own way. So there-lower oil prices are contributing to lower investment, although they're also leading to lower gas prices, which supports spending. So there are many, many things. There isn't any one thing that explains it all. But it's something that we're watching. But you do see growth in services, so you-this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that's kind of the two big pieces of it that you see. Then you see the crosscurrents. If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that-concerns about global growth and trade developments-you have the full picture. And I think what that picture-what we took away from that picture is that we'd like to see more, that we do see these risks, and what we want to do is, we want to watch and see whether they continue to weigh upon the outlook. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee, Bloomberg Television and Radio. If consumer spending is solid and business investment has been slowed by uncertainty, I'd like to get your thinking on what a Fed rate cut would do? Have you modeled the additional growth and inflation you might get from a rate cut? Can you identify any sectors that would benefit from a lower cost of capital? Or is this really about the Fed being the only game in town? CHAIR POWELL. Well, we have the tools we have, and we're committed and sworn to use them to support economic activity. And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood-some more directly tied to interest rates than others. But we do generally believe that-that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well. And so we will use those tools and use them as we see as appropriate to achieve our objectives, which really are to sustain this expansion, and I would just make a note of that. The reason why we say ""sustain the expansion"" is, you're seeing now, for the first time, you know, communities that are being brought into the benefits of this expansion that hadn't been earlier. You're 10 years deep into this, and that's something we heard quite a lot at the conference in Chicago on the review. And I just would say, that's why we think-it's one of the reasons why we think it's so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven't seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time. MICHAEL MCKEE. But given your description of the crosscurrents, do you think Fed policy can solve those problems? CHAIR POWELL. So we take the-you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools. You know, we don't-we react to anything in principle that could undermine our achievement of our dual-mandate goals-maximum employment, stable prices-is worthy of our attention and can call forth a policy response. And that's just how we look at it. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. You've said that the Fed doesn't take short-term political considerations into account, and you've defended the Fed's independence. So I was wondering, is there a point at which you think that, publicly or privately, you should push back on the President's criticisms rather than ignoring him? And also, do you think that you and the President have the same goals when it comes to monetary policy? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I don't-I don't discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really. So I would just say that we are-at the Fed, we're deeply committed to carrying out our mission, and also that our independence from direct political control we see as an important institutional feature that has served both the economy and the country well. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, are you concerned that new digital currencies like Libra, which Facebook unveiled this week, could undermine the Fed and erode your power to influence the economy? And did anyone from Facebook talk with anyone at the Fed before Libra was unveiled this week? CHAIR POWELL. So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we're a long way from that. And, of course, the-so I think we're a long way from that. Digital currencies are in their infancy. So, essentially, not too concerned about, you know, the central banks no longer being able to carry out monetary policy because of cryptocurrencies or digital currencies. You know, Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds in-around the world really with regulators, supervisors, and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us. And we're-you know, it's something we're looking at. We meet with a broad range of private-sector firms all the time on financial technology, and there's just a tremendous amount of innovation going on out there. You know, there are potential benefits here. There are also potential risks, particularly of a currency that could, you know, that could potentially have large application. So I would echo what Governor Carney said, which is that we will wind up having quite high expectations, from a sort of safety and soundness and regulatory standpoint, if they do decide to go forward with something. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Do you think the Fed will be involved in regulating Libra then? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we have-we don't have plenary authority over cryptocurrencies as such. They play into our world through consumer protection and money laundering and things like that. But, I would say that, you know, through international forums, you know, we have significant input into the payment system and, as you know, play an important role in the payment system here in the United States. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I want to take you back to Chicago and the review of your monetary policy strategy. And something interesting, I think, is developing, is that outside experts are excited and are-like the idea of the Fed shifting your inflation target up to 4 percent-around there, roughly, I guess. They think that that would, you know, help monetary policy, and that there's no-2 percent is not, like, sanctimonious or anything, or whatever, sacred. It seems that you've taken that off the table. So I was wondering if you could discuss that. Have you taken it off the table? And then, if so, why, or-and what's your thoughts on that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. We have-we've said that we wouldn't look at raising the target rate for inflation. We did say that. And the reason is, it's become a global norm, 2 percent. Our statutory mandate is price stability. And so we're actually taking a less-we're looking at less radical ideas, such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible. This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular. So it's a new thing for us. It's something that-I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do. It'll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications. And it's meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve. We've had a series of Fed Listens around the country at every Reserve Bank, and we had an academic conference earlier this month, with seven papers written and criticized, and leading global experts. But I'll just say, again, that the heart of the conference was the two panels on-with practitioners in low and moderate income-who live in low- and moderate-income communities and are part of those communities. And they were-there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is and what it means in their communities. You know, the idea being, they haven't had, you know, a bull market in these communities. They haven't had, just, a booming economy. What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems. And just now, you have, you know, companies who want to hire and are bringing people into the-providing opportunities for people to come into the labor force to an extent not seen in quite a long time. And that is, I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating, too. So I think everybody thought, you know, that's-that was really quite worth doing. I mean, there was some thought at the beginning that we should-some people recommended that we just talk to, you know, econ Ph.D.'s about this, but, no, that's not what we chose to do, and we're glad this is the choice we made. GREG ROBB. But even those two panels that you just referenced, the people that spoke, they-when they were asked about, you know, 2 percent inflation or higher inflation, they kind of shrugged their shoulders, you know? So-is 4 percent inflation radical? And to who? CHAIR POWELL. I don't think it's-I don't think it's a practical alternative. And I'll tell you why. I think you see disinflationary pressures around the world. You see central banks having a hard time getting inflation up to their-close to their objective. We've done better than other large central banks that are not, you know, open economies, like the U.K., where you have big currency moves that move inflation around. So-but it's quite challenging to get inflation-it's been-even with very high levels of resource utilization, inflation has been lingering and not getting back up to target in a sustained, symmetric kind of a way. So saying that you're going to go for 4 percent-I wonder how credible that will be. JOHN HELTMAN. John Heltman with American Banker. I have a question about the Fed's-or, I guess, the bank regulators' leveraged lending guidance from 2013. As you know, the GAO had a letter saying that they thought it was a rule, and it sort of went away. But yet leveraged lending is a source of concern. You yourself have said that credit underwriting quality seems to be deteriorating somewhat lately, and that the Fed has tools to supervise banks and to prevent leveraged lending from becoming too much of an issue. I want to know what the-is the 2013 guidance still representative of the, sort of, Fed's thinking about leveraged lending? And does the Fed have any intent-intention to either issue, like, a leveraged lending rule or a new guidance that is less problematic? Or is the plan to just kind of carry on with supervision as you're-as you are? CHAIR POWELL. So the 2013 guidance is not binding, and that's what came out of the GAO review. But that's really the beginning of this-of the story. You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure. So, this-the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they're running and the pipeline-you know, the obligations that they've undertaken to underwrite deals. And so we monitor that very carefully-so do the banks-and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis. And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests. We impose very large losses on those portfolios, so we kind of have a sense of what that is, whereas before the crisis, there was a lot of lack of knowledge about what the losses would be. So that's where it starts for us in supervision, is the risks that the banks are running-you know, running on their own books and to themselves and to each other. So, in that, I feel-I feel like that is-that's in a good place, but we never-we never say ""Mission accomplished"" on that. We will keep-you know, keep monitoring that carefully. What's happened, though, is, the paper is now owned by market-based vehicles: collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds, and things like that. And so we now have-you know, we have a good sense of, domestically, of where that paper is. I think, internationally, not as much, and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that. And we-you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are. And they're actually pretty stably funded, in the sense that there's no run risk, but there's still macroeconomic risk. And, you know, this is something that we take very seriously and that the FSOC, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, is looking at. And, you know, we call it out as a macroeconomic risk, but it's not really a financial stability risk, in the sense that it could undermine the ability of the financial system to do its job of intermediating credit. JOHN HELTMAN. Is there any intention, is there any plan on the part of the Fed or other regulators to sort of create any additional clarity for, or-and consistency, really-that's the other point of guidance, right?-is to make sure everyone knows kind of what the supervisory expectations are for leveraged lending and for all-for anything, for that matter. Is anything else coming? Or is it just going to remain kind of, like, bilateral kind of conversations with banks? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the issue isn't that the banks don't understand what the rules are. The issue is that the risk isn't in the banks. It's in-it's out in those market-based vehicles. So I don't, I don't-you know, I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job. But my sense is, though, that that's really not the problem. I'm not saying it's perfect, but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running. And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market-based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present? And we're very carefully assessing that. And we continue to take all these risks seriously. You know, I gave a whole speech about this a few weeks ago, so. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I'm just wondering if you could expand a little bit on the labor market. So the statement noted that the labor market still remains strong, but the May jobs report that that we saw missed on estimates, but employment rates still stayed at 3.6 percent. I'm wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that we only got 3.1 percent year-over-year wage growth in that report. What does that tell you about employment, and by all standards compared to, say, a month ago or a year ago, are we closer or farther away from full employment or maximum employment? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we have to be closer, because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force. The unemployment rate is lower. You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place. You mentioned wages. So the level of wages is very consistent with what it should be, in the sense that it's approximately equal to inflation plus productivity increases on an hourly basis. So what's, I guess, a little surprising, though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late-you know, long into a cycle, let's say, and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they're growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they're not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation. So, you know, we watch-we watch all of this very carefully, and I think we're very careful about not assuming that we're, you know, that would-that there's no more slack in the labor market. You know, we've all lived through-you know, when I got to the Fed, we were in the 8 percent-plus range, and it's just gone down and down and down, and you haven't seen wages picked up. You haven't seen real signals that we're at maximum employment. You have seen a tightening labor market. You know, it-the surveys that I mentioned will all show that the labor market has tightened, but not overtightened. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market News. I wanted to ask-did the FOMC discuss a change to its balance sheet policy at this meeting, perhaps ending runoffs earlier than planned? And would the Committee be inclined to do something like that if it lowers rates before September? CHAIR POWELL. So, of course, we haven't made any decisions yet. Balance sheet runoff is very close to the end of its planned life. I would say this: If we do provide more accommodation-again, we haven't really addressed this-but if we do provide more accommodation, we'll certainly keep in mind what we said earlier this year, which is that we'll always be willing to adjust balance sheet policy so that it serves our dual-mandate objectives. Thank you very much."

"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference July 31, 2019 CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. We decided today to lower the target for the federal funds rate by Â¼ percentage point to a range of 2 percent to 2Â¼ percent. The outlook for the U.S. economy remains favorable, and this action is designed to support that outlook. It is intended to insure against downside risks from weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, to help offset the effects these factors are currently having on the economy, and to promote a faster return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective. All of these objectives will support achievement of our overarching goal: to sustain the expansion, with a strong job market and inflation close to our objective, for the benefit of the American people. We also decided to conclude the runoff of our securities portfolio in August rather than in September, as previously planned. And I'll discuss the thinking behind today's interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward. As the year began, both the economy and monetary policy were in a good place. The unemployment rate was below 4 percent, and inflation had been running near our 2 percent objective for nine months. Our interest rate target was at the low end of estimates of neutral. Over the first half of the year, the economy grew at a healthy pace and job gains pushed unemployment to near a half-century low. Wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives. This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. Through the course of the year, weak global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have prompted the FOMC to adjust its assessment of the appropriate path of interest rates. The Committee moved from expecting rate increases this year to a patient stance about any changes and then to today's action. The median Committee participant's assessments of the neutral rate of interest and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment have also declined this year, reinforcing the case for a somewhat lower path for our policy rate. These changes in the anticipated path of interest rates have eased financial conditions and have supported the economy. At our June meeting, many Committee participants saw that the case for lowering the federal funds rate had strengthened, but the Committee wanted to get a better sense of the overall direction of events. Since then, we have seen both positive and negative developments. Job growth was strong in June and, looking through month-to-month fluctuations, the data point to continued strength. We expect job growth to be slower than last year but above what we believe is required to hold the unemployment rate steady. GDP growth in the second quarter came in close to expectations. Consumption-supported by rising incomes and high household confidence-is the main engine driving the economy forward. But manufacturing output has declined for two consecutive quarters, and business fixed investment fell in the second quarter. Foreign growth has disappointed, particularly in manufacturing and notably in the euro area and China. In response to this weakness, many central banks around the world are increasing policy accommodation or contemplating doing so. After simmering early in the year, trade policy tensions nearly boiled over in May and June but now appear to have returned to a simmer. Looking through this variability, our business contacts tell us that the ongoing uncertainty is making some companies more cautious about their capital spending. The domestic inflation shortfall has continued. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices and is a better gauge of future developments than is total inflation, has run at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months. We continue to expect that inflation will return over time to 2 percent. But domestic inflation pressures remain muted, and global disinflationary pressures persist. Wages are rising, but not at a pace that would put much upward pressure on inflation. We are mindful that inflation's return to 2 percent may be further delayed, and that continued below-target inflation could lead to a worrisome and difficult-to-reverse downward slide in longer-term expectations. So taking all of that on board, the Committee still sees a favorable baseline outlook. Over the year, however, incoming information on global growth, trade policy uncertainty, and muted inflation have led the Committee to gradually lower its assessments of the path of policy interest rate that would best support that outlook. Today, we judge that those factors warrant the policy adjustment I described: ""As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective."" Thank you. I am happy to take your questions. "

"MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger with the Associated Press. Mr. Chairman, when you cut rates in July, you characterized it as a ""midcycle adjustment."" Is that still your view of what's happening? CHAIR POWELL. So, as you can see from our policy statement and from the SEP, we see a favorable economic outlook, with continued moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective. And, by the way, that view is consistent with those of many other forecasters. As you can see, FOMC participants generally think that these positive economic outcomes will be achieved with modest adjustments to the federal funds rate. At the last press conference, I pointed to two episodes in, I guess, 1995 and 1998 as examples of such an approach, which was successful in both of those instances. As our statement also highlights, though, there are risks to this positive outlook due particularly to weak global growth and trade developments. And if the economy does turn down, then a more extensive sequence of rate cuts could be appropriate. We don't see that-it's not what we expect-but we would certainly follow that path if it became appropriate. In other words, as we say in our statement, we will continue to monitor these developments closely, and we will act as appropriate to help ensure that the expansion remains on track. RICHARD MILLER. [Inaudible remark] I'm sorry. Rich Miller with Bloomberg. Taking the statement, your opening remarks, and the SEP, I'm just wondering what kind of message we should take from this. Do you still-does the FOMC-is it safe to say the FOMC still has an easing bias or not? CHAIR POWELL. So the idea of having a bias is something that was a longtime practice, and we don't actually have that practice anymore, so I can't really adopt it right here. But, nonetheless, I'll respond to your question. So we did-we made one decision today, and that decision was to lower the federal funds rate by Â¼ percentage point. We believe that action is appropriate to promote our objectives, of course. We're going to be highly data dependent, as always. Our decisions are going to depend on the implications of incoming information for the outlook, and I would also say, as we often do, that we're not on a preset course. So that's how we're going to look at it. We're going to be carefully looking at economic data. Sometimes the path ahead is clear and sometimes less so. So we're going to be looking carefully, meeting by meeting, at the full range of information, and we're going to assess the appropriate stance of policy as we go. And, as I said, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. RICHARD MILLER. If I could just follow up, you've also said that the favorable outlook is predicated on financial conditions, and the financial conditions are in turn predicated on an outlook for Fed policy-in this case, further cuts. Wouldn't that suggest that you should be inclined to-if you want those financial conditions and that favorable outlook to come about, you should be inclined to cut? CHAIR POWELL. Well, what we do going forward is very much going to depend, Rich, on the flow of data and information. We've seen-you know, if you look at the things we're monitoring, particularly global growth and trade developments, global growth has continued to weaken. I think it's weakened since our last meeting. Trade developments have been up and down and then up, I guess-or back up, perhaps-over the course of this intermeeting period. In any case, they've been quite volatile. So we do see those risks as actually more heightened now. We're going to be watching that carefully. We're also going to be watching the U.S. data quite carefully, and we'll have to make an assessment as we go. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. I know you're trying to speak for the Committee when you do these press conferences, but the Committee is clearly divided right now, at least about the outlook and the appropriate policy path. Some people think you need to wait and see the labor market and the consumer crack or weaken further before acting more aggressively, and some people think that by the time that happens, you'll need to do even more aggressive action to arrest a downturn. Where do you stand on this? CHAIR POWELL. Well, let me just say, on the general point of diverse perspectives, you're right. Sometimes the-and there have been many of those times in my now almost eight years at the Fed, many times when the direction is relatively clear and it's relatively easy to reach unanimity. This is a time of difficult judgments and, as you can see, disparate perspectives. And I really do think that's nothing but healthy, and so I see a benefit in having those diverse perspectives, really. So your question, though, is? NICK TIMIRAOS. This is to your own view, because the data is, to some extent, lagged, especially when you have these risks on the horizon, and the markets obviously think that these risks could materialize more than what you and your colleagues are projecting in the dot plot today. So, I wonder, where are your own views about the tension between risk management, which implies some degree of data independence, and this idea of being data dependent? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I'll try to get at that this way. I think that the idea that if you see trouble approaching on the horizon, you steer away from it if you can-I think that's a good idea in principle, and I think history teaches us that it's better to be proactive in adjusting policy if you can. I think applying that principle in a particular situation is where the challenge comes. So I told you where the Committee-the bulk of the Committee is going, meeting by meeting, and I think the main takeaway is that this is a Committee that has shifted its policy stance repeatedly, consistently, through the course of the year to support economic activity as it has felt that it's appropriate. At the beginning of the year we were looking at further rate increases, then we were patient, and then we cut once, then we cut again. And I think you've seen us being willing to move based on data, based on the evolving risk picture, and I have no reason to think that will change. I think-but it will continue to be data dependent, and depend-data includes the evolving risk picture. That's where I am, and that's where I think the bulk of the Committee is. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you're-oh, sorry. Steve Liesman, CNBC. I've only done this a dozen-a lot of times. I wonder if you're concerned about how the Federal Reserve operated through the recent liquidity crunch in markets. We talked to many traders who said the tax date payment was known well in advance. There were several reports of people pointing to September as a potential crunch time. You closed Monday at the top end of the fed funds rate. Tuesday came along, and there wasn't an operation until nine o'clock and no announcement until-of a second operation until four o'clock in the afternoon. Was the Fed listening to markets well ahead of time, going back a year when there were blowouts in the overnight rate at year-end and the turn of the year? Are you concerned about how, for example, the New York Fed operated through this? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I would say I doubt that anyone is closer to and has more invested in carefully following the-you know, the behavior of these markets. So, of course, we were well aware of the-you know, the tax payments and also of the settlement of the large bond purchases. And, you know, we were very much waiting for that. But we didn't expect-the response to that was stronger than we expected. And, by the way, our sense is that it surprised market participants a lot, too. You know, people were writing about this and publishing stories about it weeks ago. It wasn't a surprise, but it was-it was a stronger response than-certainly than we expected. So, no, I'm not concerned about that, to answer your question. I can go on a little bit about how we're looking at that. Why don't I do that? So, as I mentioned, it doesn't-we don't see this as having any implications for the broader economy or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates. The strains in the money markets reflect forces that we saw coming, and they just had a bigger effect than I think most folks anticipated-strong demand for cash to purchase Treasuries and pay corporate taxes. We took appropriate actions to address those pressures, to keep the fed funds rate within the target range, and those measures were successful. If we experience another episode of pressures in money markets, we have the tools to address those pressures. We will not hesitate to use them. And since we're talking about this, let me take a step back and say this. Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime. And we've been operating in that regime for a full decade. We think it works well to implement our rate decisions. The main hallmark of that regime is that we use adjustments in our administered rates-the IOER and RRP rates-to keep the fed fund rates in the target range. It's designed specifically so that we do not expect to be conducting frequent open market operations for that purpose. So, going forward, we're going to be very closely monitoring market developments and assessing their implications for the appropriate level of reserves, and we're going to be assessing, you know, the question of when it will be appropriate to resume the organic growth of our balance sheet. And I'm sure we'll be revisiting that question during this intermeeting period and certainly at our next meeting. STEVE LIESMAN. Could I just follow up here quickly? Do you think you've underestimated the amount of reserves necessary for the banking system? CHAIR POWELL. So we've always said that it's-that the level is uncertain, right? And that's something we've tried to be very clear about. And as you know, we've invested lots of time talking to many of the large holders of reserves to assess their-what they say is their demand for reserves. We try to assess what that is. We've tried to combine all of that together. We put it out so the public can react to it. But, yes, there's real uncertainty, and it is certainly possible that we will need to resume the organic growth of the balance sheet earlier than we thought. That's always been a possibility, and it certainly is now. Again, we'll be looking at this carefully in coming days and taking it up at the next meeting. BRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley with the Financial Times. Earlier this year-or, actually, in September, the Governors' Board put out a research paper looking-trying to quantify trade uncertainty. And it suggested that it could drag through the business investment channel on growth as much as a percentage point over the course of the next year. How much confidence do you have in the Fed's ability to estimate the real effects of trade uncertainty? And if you have confidence in that paper, it would seem to suggest a-sort of a more aggressively dovish path than the one that you've chosen. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I think to provide a little context, Fed economists do research all the time. It's generally of very high quality. It's their research. It's not an official finding of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve System. It's just-and, by the way, they put it out for public review so that you can see their econometrics, so you can see all of it-their whole work is exposed to critique by the whole profession. So it's a great tradition that we have. And, you know, what this particular piece of work did is, it went after measuring trade policy uncertainty through a couple of channels, including concerning tariffs, also concerning the threat of more tariffs, and it looked deeply at the data to try to assess the effects on output. And while I would say, directly answering your question, there's real uncertainty around these-around these effects. It's a $22 trillion economy. To try to isolate the effects of certain things is very challenging, but we do the best we can. So-and this piece of research found significant effects, and that's frankly consistent with a number of other research projects that economists have undertaken. It's also consistent with what we've been hearing in the Beige Book. So, I mean, I think if you take a step back from that, we do feel that trade uncertainty is having an effect. You see it in weak business investment, weak exports-hard to quantify it precisely, though. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters. I was struck by the sort of anchored median federal funds rate here through 2020, and that in comparison to the fact that you now have sort of three very discrete groups of opinions around where the fed funds rate is heading. And I wondered, is it fair to say that the-those opinions have become sort of firmer in their conviction, and that it's going to take some sort of real material change in the outlook now for that to move in either direction? CHAIR POWELL. And you're asking specifically about 2020? HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Well, the fact that this-the fed funds rate is now seen as not moving through 2020 suggests to me that these opinions are pretty-pretty well anchored right now in those groups. CHAIR POWELL. You know, honestly, I think it's hard to have hardened expectations about where rate policy is going to be a year from now. I think the closer you get to the current day, the more confidence you can have. But even then, knowing where the-knowing what the data will say and the way geopolitical events and other events are going to evolve in the next 90 days and the implications of that for the economy, I would say there's a lot of uncertainty around that. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Fair enough, but if- CHAIR POWELL. Particularly, if you look at 2020, I think the use of this is, individual participants write down their forecasts. It should give you a sense of how people are thinking about the likely path of the economy and the appropriate path for monetary policy in that individual person's thinking, and I think that's a good thing to know. I think I'd be very reluctant to look at it as hardened views or a prediction, really. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. But just to follow up, if I could. There were a number of arguments in July around the reason for cutting rates. Have any of those gotten substantially weaker or changed around the table? CHAIR POWELL. You know, well, I think, if you look at the U.S.-look at the U.S. economy, the U.S. economy has generally performed roughly as expected-roughly: The consumer is spending at a healthy clip, I'd say business fixed investment and exports have weakened further, and I'd say the manufacturing PMI suggests more weakness ahead. The labor market is still strong, though, so generally that is the same. I think if you look at-the global economy, I think, has weakened further in the EU and China, and I think, you know, trade policy developments have been a big mover of markets and of sentiment during that intermeeting period. So that's why I think what's-that's what's happened over the intermeeting period, and, you know, different people around the table have different perspectives as you obviously know. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. I'm just curious on your balance sheet point. You talked about the Committee thinking about resuming organic growth, you know, over time. I guess the question is, if you have shrunk your balance sheet maybe just a little bit too small to the point that reserves are too scarce to get through sort of these unusual periods, is organic growth in the balance sheet enough to get back to a point of ample reserves that can get us through those tough times, or would you need to see something a little bit above that? And is that a possibility the Committee would consider? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think it's hard to deal with every hypothetical possibility. I think, for the foreseeable future, we're going to be looking at, if needed, doing the sorts of things that we did the last two days-these temporary open market operations. That will be the tool that we use. And the question will be, then-as we go through quarter-end, as we learn more, you know, what really-how much of this really has to do with the level of reserves? And I think we'll learn quite a lot in the next six weeks. VICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. Another money market question. You know, banks have been pointing to liquidity rules as having contributed to some of the volatility we've seen in repo markets and, you know, potentially some capital rules as well. Are you all looking at whether, you know, some tweaks to the liquidity coverage ratio might help? And, also, what is the status of the net stable funding ratio rule? Are you all still planning on putting that out soon? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I think if we concluded that we needed to raise the level of required reserves for banks to meet the LCR, we'd probably raise the level of reserves rather than lower the LCR. I mean, it's not impossible that we would come to a view that the LCR is calibrated too high, but that's not something that we think right now. On the other hand, it might be that more reserves are needed, in which case we are in a position to supply them. In terms of the net stable funding ratio, it's-I believe we put it out for comment and got comments, and I believe we're looking at-at finalizing that in the relatively near future. VICTORIA GUIDA. Just-just to follow up, I mean, in terms of tweaks to the LCR, I mean, there's also been some talk about potentially giving banks some room in times of stress to maybe dip into their liquidity buffers. CHAIR POWELL. I think we want banks to, you know-to use their liquidity buffers in times of stress rather than pull back from the markets and pull back from serving their clients as a general rule. EDWARD LAWRENCE. So, about a month ago-Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. About a month ago or so you said that there's no precedent to integrate trade uncertainty into monetary policy. In the last few weeks, have you figured out how to incorporate trade uncertainty-and this level of trade uncertainty-into monetary policy going forward? You've talked about uncertainty many times today. CHAIR POWELL. So my point, really, was that-to start, that trade policy is not the business of the Fed, it's the business of Congress and the Administration. But-so why are we talking about it? We're talking about it because anything that affects the achievement of our goals can, in principle, be something that monetary policy should take into consideration. And our discussions and the research we have suggests that trade policy is something that's weighing on the outlook. So I pointed out in recent remarks that the thing we can't address, really, is what businesses would like, which is a settled roadmap for international trade. We can't do that. We don't have that tool. But we do have a very powerful tool which can counteract weakness, to some extent, by supporting demand through sound monetary policy. And we think our policy tools support economic activity through fairly well-understood channels: by reducing interest burden and encouraging consumer purchase of durables, of homes, and other interest-sensitive items; by creating broadly more accommodative financial conditions, which support spending and also investment by businesses; and also by boosting household and business confidence. So, you know, I don't want to be heard to say that our tools don't have an effect. They do. But I was making the point that there is a piece of this that we really can't address. EDWARD LAWRENCE. So have you figured out how to navigatge it? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think, yeah. I mean, it's a challenge. There's no simple bottom-line answer where I can say, yes, I've got it for you here. But what it amounts to is this: What you see is probably the kind of volatility that's typical of an important, complex, ongoing negotiation. And I think what we need to do is to try to look through the volatility and react to the underlying forces, the underlying things that are happening that are relevant to our mandate. We don't-we have nothing to do with setting trade policy or negotiating trade agreements. We're supposed to be reacting on behalf of the American economy to support maximum employment and stable prices. So we need to look through what's a pretty volatile situation. So that means not overreacting quickly. It means not underreacting, too. So that's really what we're trying to do. And, you know, I would say, the outlook is positive in the face of these crosswinds we've felt. And so, to some extent, I do believe that our shifting to a more accommodative stance over the course of the year has been one of the reasons why the outlook has remained favorable. MICHAEL MCKEE. Fed funds-Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television. Fed funds futures trading since the statement was released shows that investors still think that another rate cut is coming this year. On their behalf, let me ask, what is going to guide Fed policy to either pull them towards where the dot plot suggests no more moves this year or keep them in place? Are you reacting to data now? Are you reacting to your gut feeling about what trade tweets might mean? Should they just watch for Jay Powell speeches to decide what's going to happen going forward? What's the Fed's reaction function now? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So what we are looking for through all of the data, all the events that are going on around the world, we'll be looking at, you know, the evolving geopolitical events, we'll be looking at global growth, we'll be looking at trade policy uncertainty. Most importantly, we'll be looking at the performance of the U.S. economy. We'll be looking for things that are affecting the outlook for the U.S. economy, particularly the outlook as it relates to maximum employment and stable prices. So all of those things in principle can affect the achievement of our goals. It's an unusual situation, because, you know, the U.S. economy itself-the largest part of it, the consumer part of it-is in strong shape. The manufacturing part, less so. But, overall, you see an economy that-I think, generally, forecasts show growth similar to our own, forecasts coming in about 2 percent, which is a good, solid year. So the difference here is, we have significant, really, risks to that outlook from not just the geopolitical events, but also from slowing global growth and trade policy uncertainty. So we'll be looking at all of that and also financial market conditions and how they are affecting the outlook. I can't-it's a challenging time, I admit it, but we really have to be open to all those things. We're not on a preset course. We're going to be making decisions meeting by meeting as we see this, and, you know, we'll try to be as transparent as we can as we go. DONNA BORAK. Donna Borak. Hi, Chairman Powell. Donna Borak with CNN. With the rate cut today and potentially another modest adjustment coming down the road, do you worry about lessening the Fed's firepower should there be a recession? And is there any scenario in which you would envision rates drifting lower into negative territory? And are there any other tools that you could use before having to go there? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. You know, in terms of firepower, I think the general principle, as I mentioned earlier, is, it can be a mistake to try to hold onto your firepower until a downturn gains momentum, and then-so there's a fair amount of research that would show that that's the case. Now, I think that principle needs to be applied carefully to the situation at hand. What we believe we're facing here-what we think we're facing here is a situation which can be addressed and should be addressed with moderate adjustments to the federal funds rate. As I mentioned, we are watching carefully to see whether that is the case. If, in fact, the economy weakens more, then we're prepared to be aggressive, and we'll do so if it turns out to be appropriate. You mentioned negative interest rates. So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do. We chose to-after we got to the effective lower bound, we chose to do a lot of aggressive forward guidance and also large-scale asset purchases, and those were the two unconventional monetary policy tools that we used extensively. We feel that they worked fairly well. We did not use negative rates. And I think if we were to find ourselves at some future date again at the effective lower bound-again, not something we are expecting-then I think we would look at using large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance. I do not think we'd be looking at using negative rates. I just don't think those will be at the top of our list. By the way, we are in the middle of a monetary policy review where we're looking through all of these questions about the longer-run framework-the strategy, tools, and communications-and we expect that to be completed sometime around the middle of next year. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. How much-can you talk about the mechanism in which the two rate cuts will affect the real economy? And how much-to what extent will it offset the negative effects of the trade uncertainty and tensions? CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of how our rate cuts will affect the real economy, first, we think monetary policy works with, as Friedman said, long and variable lags. So I think the real effects will be felt over time. But, you know, we think that lower interest rates will reduce interest burden for borrowers, so that interest-sensitive things like housing and durable goods and other things like that-cars-it supports purchases of those. Just, again, broadly, more accommodative financial conditions-higher asset prices. That's-the models and the data show that that's another powerful channel. I also think there's a confidence channel. You see-you see household and business confidence turn up when financial conditions become more accommodative. So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works. It isn't, you know, precisely the right tool for every single possible negative thing that can happen to the economy, but, nonetheless, it broadly works, and, you know, we're going to use the tool we have. And if it comes to it, we'll use all of our tools. So that's how we think it works and how we think it's working. DON LEE. And how much will it offset the trade impact, do you think? CHAIR POWELL. It's very hard to say. It's-you know, it's tough to say. We'll-we'll use our tools to offset negative-that's really the job of monetary policy, is, to the extent it can, to offset, you know, things that drive us away from maximum employment and stable prices. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. I'm Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, are you worried that the low interest rates are adding to, or could create a bubble of, consumer and corporate debt that could make it more difficult for, especially, consumers to recover from the next recession or survive the next recession? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so, if you look at-if you actually look at households, households are in very strong shape. They're less levered. They've got less debt. They've got more income relative to their interest requirements. And they're in very good shape-much better shape than they were in before the financial crisis. So the household sector as a sort of aggregate matter is in very good shape. That doesn't mean that every single person in the household sector is in good shape, but, overall, it's really not a concern. The business sector is something that, you know, we've talked about a lot and studied a lot, and the situation there is that the level of debt relative to GDP in the business sector is at a high level. However, so is the size of the business sector. So, actually, the business sector itself is not materially higher leveraged than it was. Nonetheless, there are a lot of highly levered companies, and that's the kind of thing that happens during a long cycle when there aren't downturns for, now, into our 11th year. You get-you know, you do get that kind of phenomenon in a long cycle. So that's something we're monitoring, and I think our view still is that that's a real issue, but what it really represents is a potential amplifier of a macroeconomic downturn. It does not have the makings of anything that would undermine the workings of the financial system, for example, or itself create a shock that would turn the economy down. It's more of-it's more of an amplifier. We take it very seriously, though, and, you know, we're monitoring it carefully. We're actually looking-the Financial Stability Board is actually conducting a project right now to identify where these loans are held all around the world. So it's the subject of a lot of study and work, and, you know, we're trying to keep on top of it. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I'm kind of hearing two things from you. You're saying that the economy is doing well, but there's this sense with people that the economy is actually starting to slow now. And people are-more and more, you talk-there's talk about recession, so you-and even the Fed thinks the downside risks are rising. So is the economy over the next year-between now and the end of next year, do you think GDP growth is going to hold steady, and the unemployment rate-could you talk about, just, how do you see the economy evolving over the next year? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so, I think-and my colleagues and I, I think, all think that the most likely case is for continued moderate growth, continued strong labor market, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent. And I think that's, by the way, widely shared among forecasters. You know, the issue is more the risks to that. You have downside risks here, and we've talked about them. It's that global growth will have an effect on U.S. growth over time- less so than for many other economies, but, still, there's a sector of our economy that's exposed to that. Trade policy uncertainty also has-apparently has an effect. So-and you can see some weakness in the U.S. economy because of all that. But, nonetheless-so the job of monetary policy is to adjust both to ensure against those downside risks, but also to support the economy in light of the existing weakness that we do see. So we're not-as I mentioned, we're not-we don't see a recession. We're not forecasting a recession. But we are adjusting monetary policy in a more accommodative direction to try to support what is, in fact, a favorable outlook. GREG ROBB. And the inverted yield curve that we hear is the bond market signaling recession-what do you-is that-so that's not-that signal is not pertinent to you? Or where do you- CHAIR POWELL. No, we do-so we monitor the yield curve carefully, along with a large, wide range of financial conditions. We don't-so, it's not-there's no one thing that is dispositive among all financial conditions. The yield curve is something that we follow carefully. And, again, based on our assessment of all the data, we still think it's a positive outlook. The thing-so, just to talk about the current situation, you see-you saw long-term rates move down a whole lot and then retrace two-thirds of that move in the space of a few days. So I think what really matters for all financial conditions generally is when there are changes-material changes that are sustained for a period of time. So-but why are long-term rates low? There are a number-there can be a signal about expectations about growth there for sure, but there can also just be low term premiums. For example, just-well, it can just be that there's this large quantity of negative-yielding and very low-yielding sovereign debt around the world, and, inevitably, that's exerting downward pressure on U.S. sovereign rates without really necessarily having an independent signal. Nonetheless, that is a signal about weak global growth, probably, and weak global growth would affect us. So global capital markets and the global economy are quite integrated, so this is something we pay careful-we're not going to be dismissive about the yield curve, but-and I think you can tell, on the Committee, there's a range of views-there are some who are very focused on the yield curve, others not so much. You know, from my perspective, you watch it carefully, and, you know, I think you need to be asking yourself a lot of questions if the yield curve is inverted as to why that is and how long it's sustained. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. You mentioned trade policy being a complex, ongoing discussion. What is your rule for stopping as far as interest rate cuts go? You referred to this as a ""midcycle adjustment."" The median dot suggests no more rate cuts, but, you know, if we get continued kind of back-and-forth between the U.S. and China, trade policy uncertainty is going to remain heightened. So, you know, under what circumstances would you say, ""You know what, I think we've cut enough, we stop now""? And, secondly, as leader of this institution, have you felt a need to take any steps to boost, like, employee morale at a time when the President is constantly criticizing the Fed? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. You know, I'd love to be able to articulate a simple, straightforward stopping rule, but it's really just going to be when we think we've done enough. And, you know, our eyes are open. We're watching the situation. We've cut rates twice. We've moved, really, through the course of this year, as I discussed, and, you know, we see ourselves as taking actions to sustain the expansion and thereby achieve our goals. And if you look at sort of the things that are happening in the economy, I think I personally see a high value in sustaining the expansion, because we really are reaching-this positive economy is reaching communities that haven't been reached in a long time. There would be great benefit in having that last as long as possible, that's all. So I don't have a specific stopping rule for you, but I think we're watching carefully, and there will come a time, I suspect, when we think we've done enough, but there may also come a time when the economy worsens, and we would then have to cut more aggressively. We don't know. We're going to be watching things carefully. The incoming data and the evolving situation and-that's what's going to guide our-guide us on that path. In terms of the morale of the institution, I would say it's very high. We're very unified. We feel like we're doing the best job we can in serving the American people. HANNAH LANG. Hi, Chairman. Hannah Lang with American Banker. It's been reported that the CFPB is investigating Bank of America for opening unauthorized accounts. I'm wondering if the Fed is also investigating this and, given the pending order against Wells Fargo, if you're concerned that these banks are too big to manage. CHAIR POWELL. You know, so I saw the headline, like, this morning during all of the preparation and everything and this morning's meeting. I really don't have anything for you on that. I will say about Wells Fargo that, you know, there were quite wide breakdowns in risk management which resulted in, you know, mistreatment of consumers that we know was quite harmful to the consumers and to the image of the institution. I have no idea whether that's what happened at Bank of America. I really don't know, standing here today. STEVEN BECKNER. Steve Beckner filing for NPR, freelance. The Fed and your fellow central banks have been sort of exploring the far reaches of what's possible for monetary policy, even going so far as to make rates negative in some cases, with mixed results. Meanwhile, fiscal and regulatory, not to mention trade, policy are pursuing their own separate courses. As you and your colleagues do this monetary policy framework review, do you ever consider the limitations of monetary policy? Should you be more explicit about what monetary policy can and cannot do in this environment? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we try to be clear about that, but, really, I think our job is to use our tools as best we can to achieve-you know, to do the jobs that Congress has assigned us, which is achieve maximum employment and stable prices. That's our real job. In terms of giving the fiscal authorities-who, by the way, are the ones who created us-advice about how to do their job, you know, we keep that at a high level, I think. And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I've said before, that it's really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with-fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers. All of that comes from the private sector, but also from more of the kinds of things that can be done with fiscal policy. Over the long run, we can't really affect the growth rate of the United States. The potential growth rate of the United States is not a function of monetary policy. It's a function of other things. So I-I try to be clear about that, and so-but, ultimately, fiscal-fiscal authorities will do what they seem-deem appropriate. SAMIRA HUSSAIN. Samira Hussain, BBC News. Mr. Trump has been a very vocal critic of you and your colleagues, recently calling you ""boneheads"" and just now has called you a ""terrible communicator."" How do you respond to these criticisms? And any regrets to have this many press conferences? CHAIR POWELL. I don't. I'm not going to change my practice here today of not responding to comments or addressing comments made by elected officials. I will just say that I continue to believe that the independence of the Federal Reserve from direct political control has served the public well over time. And I assure you that my colleagues and I will continue to conduct monetary policy without regard to political considerations. We're going to use our best judgment based on facts, evidence, and objective analysis in pursuing our goals, and that's what I have to say on it. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. Thanks for taking my question. As we saw with falling yields, at least up until the beginning of this month, there's been a lot of demand for U.S. Treasuries, and even that was partly maybe to blame for the liquidity crunch in repo markets that we saw this week. I mean, does the Fed have concerns over the impacts of a global glut for U.S. debt? Is that a conversation that you also have with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin-about what the proper way to maybe address some of the challenges down the road with that type of, kind of, heavy interest globally? CHAIR POWELL. Not really, no. That's really-that's really Treasury's job and Congress's job, in terms of, well, there's how much to spend, and how big the deficits are, and then there's how to finance it. And, you know, none of that really calls for advice from the Fed. We take-we take fiscal policy pretty much as exogenous to our work. Now, that doesn't stop us, from time to time, from saying that we think it's important that the U.S. fiscal picture return to a sustainable footing, and, you know, right now it's not. That's been the case for a long time, and that's something we will have to address, and a good time to do it is when the economy is strong. So we limit ourselves to high-level statements like that. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. Mr. Chairman, in your view, is there any risk to the United States having much higher interest rates than Europe and Japan and other parts of the world? Is there any risk to the U.S. economy to that divergence or any risk to the global economy? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, so I guess I would say it this way. Global capital markets are highly integrated, and, you know, our rates-our long rates are definitely being pulled down by the very, very low rates that are abroad. And, you know, the way I would characterize it is this: that low rates abroad are a symbol-or a sign, rather, of weak global growth, expectations of low inflation, low growth, and, you know, just kind of a lack of policy space to move against or ideas about how to break out of that low equilibrium. Now, that has implications for us. You know, we-in a world where economies and financial markets are tightly integrated, that matters for the U.S. economy. So that's going to pull down U.S. rates, and U.S. financial conditions can tighten because of that. And so I think we put all-all of that goes into our thinking and into our models. We do understand how the-you know, how the international sector interfaces with the U.S. economy. We take that into account in setting our interest rate policy. Thank you very much."

"MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg Radio and Television. So I guess the question is, is this it? Do you consider rates to be accommodative enough now to achieve your goal of sustaining the expansion? And as far as global Wall Street's primary question, what kind of change in the economy would cause you to reassess-some sort of significant deterioration in what? CHAIR POWELL. So what we've said, to repeat, is that we see the current stance of policy as ""likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook."" And we say that, really, because both of the performance of the economy and the stance of policy. The performance of the economy has been-particularly the household sector-has been strong, has been resilient, with low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, wages moving up, labor force participation moving up, household confidence, and solid gains in many measures of consumer spending. The manufacturing sector, particularly manufacturing, and also investment and exports have been weaker. But, overall, we've seen moderate growth, a strong labor market, inflation moving up. We see the outlook as for more of the same. We also see the risks to the outlook as perhaps having moved in a positive direction over the course of this intermeeting period, although, some remain-some things remain to be seen. So that's the economy. Turning to policy, we've moved the stance of policy over the course of the year to a more accommodative stance, and, after the cuts at the last three meetings, the federal funds rate is now in a range between 1Â½ and 1 percent. We feel that policy is well positioned to support the outlook that I described. So you asked what it would take, you know, to move, and, as I mentioned, we're going to be watching all factors, And if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. But that's what it would take: a material reassessment of our outlook. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up-if the markets decide that you need to cut rates again, will you be forced to follow? CHAIR POWELL. We'll be looking at a full range of data about the economy and about the risks to the outlook, and I've given you a sense of what our outlook is. It's for moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our 2 percent objective. If something happens to cause us to materially reassess that outlook, that's what would cause us to change our views on the appropriate stance of policy. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. You just said that the risks to the outlook are moving in a positive direction. I'm wondering if you could specify-is that on trade, or are there other matters? This morning we obviously learned that we've now had two quarters of contracting business investment, which would seem to be moving the outlook in the other direction. CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of risks, what I was referring to there-the principal risks that we've been monitoring have been, really, slowing global growth and trade policy developments as well as muted inflation pressure. So I was really referring there to trade developments. We have that phase-one potential agreement with China, which, if signed and put into effect, could have the effect of reducing trade tensions and reducing uncertainty, and that would bode well, we think, for business confidence and perhaps activity over time. So that has the potential for being an improvement in the risk picture. Brexit, I would say, as well-it appears that the risk of a no-deal Brexit seems to have materially declined. I think on both situations there's plenty of risk left, but I'd have to say that the risks seem to have subsided. You asked about business investment, and that's right. Business investment has been weak, and today's reading was weak as well. And it was broad across equipment and other parts of-all parts of business fixed investment were weak. That's consistent with what we've seen, but that's the economy we've had this year. What we've had is an economy where the consumer is really driving growth, and, you know, personal consumption expenditures were almost 3 percent in this quarter-in this first reading for the quarter. So, overall, we see the economy as having been resilient to the-you know, the winds that have been blowing this year. HEATHER LONG. Can I just follow up quickly? I mean, there's this concern that I sometimes hear that, with business, businesses have cut investment, and are they going to turn around and cut employment? You know, sort of, if they continue to be concerned. Can you give a sense of how the Committee is thinking-thinking through that possibility? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, so that is a risk. That's a risk that we've been monitoring, but we don't see it yet. We don't see rising initial claims or layoffs or anything like that. But the risk you mention of the weakness in the manufacturing-in export investment, business investment, parts of the economy getting into the consumer side of the economy, we really don't see that. What we continue to see is good job creation. Unemployment has declined again, and the household survey is now at a 50-year low-has been, you know, very close to 50-year lows for 18 months now. So it's very positive. The consumer-facing companies that we talk to in our vast network of contacts report, you know, that consumers are doing well and are focused on, you know, the good job market and rising incomes, and that's their principle focus. So that is the thing that's pushing the economy forward, and it doesn't seem to have been affected so far by weakness in the other areas. JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. So you've previously sort of compared this rate-cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the '90s, and in both of those instances, the Greenspan Fed took those cuts back after a while. They raised rates again fairly quickly. And I guess I'm just curious what the onus is for doing that in this cycle. What would make you guys decide it's appropriate to raise interest rates again? CHAIR POWELL. So the reason why we raised interest rates is because-generally is because we see inflation as moving up-or, in danger of moving up significantly, and we really don't see that now. Inflation moved down in the first quarter of this year. We thought that that was due, to some extent, to idiosyncratic or transient factors. That turns out to have been the case, so it's moved back up. But it seems to be settling in below 2 percent. So we really don't see that risk. And inflation expectations have also kind of moved down and sideways-both surveys and market based over the course of this-of, really, the recent months. And, you know, we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation, and we're strongly committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective on a symmetric basis. We think it's essential that we do that. So we're not thinking about raising rates right now. There obviously will be times in the future where that will be appropriate. What we're really thinking now is that our current stance of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is broadly in keeping with our expectations. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr.-Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I'm-not to make light of it, but I'm a little bit-I wonder if you could help me out with the appropriate understanding of the word ""appropriate"" here. So the statement says that the Committee is going ""to monitor the implications of incoming information for the outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range."" That tells me you could go either way. You came in, and you used the word ""appropriate,"" that the current rate is ""likely to remain appropriate,"" which means you're on hold. So how do I walk away from this, and what should we walk away from this believing what ""appropriate"" means? Are you on hold and need to be proved wrong that you should remain on hold, or is it, really, you could go either way here? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we think that the current stance of policy is likely to remain appropriate-likely to remain appropriate-as long as incoming information about the economy is broadly consistent with our outlook, which is a positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor market, and inflation moving close to 2 percent. That's-so that's what we're saying about that. We also say, of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of that outlook, we would respond accordingly. So that's really how we're thinking about it. I can't point to one data point or one thing that would change our minds. It really-it would be a reassessment of-a material reassessment of our overall outlook, which is what I described. STEVE LIESMAN. I'm sorry, just to-why isn't the phrase ""likely to remain appropriate"" in the statement if that's the sense of the Committee? CHAIR POWELL. Well, there's-there's a lot of, you know, practice and science and history, in terms of how much you put in the actual postmeeting statement as opposed to what we say in the press conference statement. It's a-you know, it's a judgment call. You know, I'm saying it now, so- STEVE LIESMAN. Thanks. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos with the Wall Street Journal. You described the recent slide, Chair Powell, in inflation expectations as ""unwelcome."" You said that inflation expectations are ""very important."" What, if anything, would the Committee be prepared to do to address this slide in inflation expectations if it continued? CHAIR POWELL. So, as I mentioned, we do think that inflation expectations are-they're quite essential, quite central in our framework of how we think about inflation. We need them to be anchored in a level-at a level that's consistent with our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. And we think that we need to conduct policy in a way that supports that outcome. That's what we're doing now. We're also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us-that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent-on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time. That's at the very heart of what we're doing in the review. It's too early to be announcing decisions. We haven't made them yet. But we're in the middle of thinking about ways that we can make that symmetric 2 percent inflation objective more credible by achieving symmetric 2 percent inflation. And it comes down to using your policy tools to achieve 2 percent inflation, and that is the-that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area. So we're committed to doing that. NICK TIMIRAOS. How soon do you think that review might be announced to the public? CHAIR POWELL. So we're in the middle-we're really quite in the middle of it now, and my thinking is still that it will run into the middle of next year. These are-you know, these changes to monetary policy frameworks happen-they don't happen really quickly, let's say. Inflation targeting took many years to evolve. I don't think we'll take many years here. I think we'll wrap it up around the middle of next year, would be my guess. I have some confidence in that. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence of Fox Business. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking this. So how big of a change, then, to monetary policy would there be if you get some of that uncertainty cleared up-specifically, the phase-one China trade deal finished and USMCA ratified? How big of a change could that be to the monetary policy as it stands here, and could we see rate cuts next year-or, rate hikes next year? I'm sorry. CHAIR POWELL. Rate hikes for next year. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes, because I've heard the argument that trade's causing the uncertainty. Uncertainty is keeping the prices low. I've heard that argument from a Fed president from one of the Districts. So you remove that uncertainty, prices, then, would naturally rise. So could there be a point, or how-I guess my question is, how big of an impact on monetary policy would removing that uncertainty be? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I would just say that a-if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade tensions-broad reduction in trade tensions and a resolution of these uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment, which is-trade uncertainty's been weighing on business sentiment, in our judgment, in the judgment of many analysts. And, ultimately, it could affect activity. I wouldn't expect that the effects on activity or confidence would be immediate, or-would there be immediate effects in economic activity. I think it would take some time after the recent things, but I do think it would be quite positive over time. You come back to the question of raising rates. So that's really about inflation. And you know, we haven't yet-we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure-just touched it for a few months, and then we've fallen back. So I think we would need to see a really significant move up in inflation that's persistent before we would consider raising rates to address inflation concerns. BRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley, the Financial Times. The other thing you've talked about in this review is the gains that a super high-pressure labor market have, particularly for the communities that you're talking about. You mentioned it just now when you were talking. If that's something that you're identifying, and that's something that the Fed is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains, particularly for people who are reentering the labor force? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think we're doing that. I mean, I think we're keeping-I think we've made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year, if you think about it. We entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we went to ""patient,"" now we've done three rate cuts. It's a very substantial shift, and the effects of it will be felt over time. So we feel like those shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you're talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, continued strong job creation. BRENDAN GREELEY. So if you were to describe the shifts that you've made so far, it wasn't just about trade uncertainty. It was about, specifically, these kinds of high-pressure labor gains that you've talked about. CHAIR POWELL. Well, no. It was-so we've said it was about three things. It's been about the slowing global economy. You have a synchronized slowdown in economic activity around the globe. It's been building for just about 18 months now, and that's having an effect on U.S. activity. That's part of the weakness in manufacturing, export, and business investment. We've had trade policy uncertainty, which we think also has been weighing on activity and investment and sentiment. And we've had inflation, which-we've called out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent as a risk that we needed to address. So we've been doing it to address all of those things. I would say, the gains in the labor market have been great to see. It's particularly the fact that people at the lower end of wages have been getting most of the benefit of most of the wage gains in the last couple of years. That's a great thing. You know from our Fed Listens events that we've been hearing from people who live and work in low- and moderate-income communities that this is the best labor market they've seen in their lifetime, things like that. And, by the way, that there's also-there's still so many people who are, you know, still not in the labor market yet, and that-there's just a lot more good that can be done there. At the same time, we have to think about the whole economy, and-but, yes, those gains are very positive. We do call them out. They are a reason for us to want to extend the expansion, and that's something we're committed to doing. VICTORIA GUIDA. On the Fed's balance sheet-you all recently resumed purchases of Treasury bills, and I was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue? And, given the fact that, you know, the repo operations-it seems like the Fed is having to increase the amount of liquidity-temporary liquidity that it's injecting into the system. You know, do you still feel like it's just-that there is not enough reserves in the system? Do you feel like you have a good sense of what's going on there? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So, on the ""how long,"" what we've said is that we expect bill purchases to continue at least into the second quarter of next year. And we've said that temporary open market operations we expect to continue, I think, at least until the end of January, I believe. Yes, through January. In terms of the causes, so there's a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts. And, you know, one thing is that we think we need reserves to be back up to the level-the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations that you see with reserves is something like $1.45 trillion or a little higher, and that's the level in early September. So we're going to be adding reserves to get back to that place. That's one thing. There are also-it may be-one thing that was surprising about the episode was that liquidity didn't seem to flow as one might have expected. We had surveyed the banks carefully about what was their lowest comfortable level of reserves, and many banks that were well above that level did not take that excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates. They just-they didn't do that, and so the question is why. And are there things that we can do that would-adjustments that we could make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily in the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness or financial stability? So we're looking at those. Those are not things that can happen that can really address the situation in the short term, but those are a range of things that we're looking at as well. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks for the questions. I wonder if you could give us a little more texture on, sort of, what the strongest or most important case is for feeling that you've now taken out adequate insurance. Is it the response you're seeing in housing and other parts of the economy, arguably, to the cuts made so far? Is it the fact that the risk environment out there globally has shifted a bit and abated a bit? Or is it something different, you know, in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve has righted itself, et cetera? CHAIR POWELL. Honestly, it's really the-there isn't any one factor. It's really the whole range of economic data and also what we see as-about our stance of policy, which we believe is the appropriate stance. It's really both of those things. Again, if you look at the performance of the economy through this, the consumer sector has been quite resilient. Witness today's GDP report. And it's just-again, all the things I went through earlier suggest that that sector continues to be strong. We know that the manufacturing, investment, trade, export sector has been weak. That continues, but nonetheless, overall, we've got an economy that is showing moderate growth, and we think that today's setting-we're now at 1.5 to 1.75 percent. That is, we believe, an accommodative level and a level that will support that outlook that we have. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. But are you concerned-just to follow up, really. This is kind of a one-legged recovery, that unless you get some impetus from other things-exports, investment-that it's going to weaken further at some point? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we don't see any evidence of that. What we see is-what we see is that the consumer sector continues strong. Again, low initial claims. It's all-the data we monitor, obviously, is a very broad range of data. We also see now, I think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary policy on various kinds of consumer activity. You're seeing strong durable goods sales. You're seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while-two-tenths, I think, this quarter. And you're seeing retail sales-the retail sales number, the PCE number, as I mentioned, in today's release was 2.9 percent. So that's good. And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers' incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You were just talking about how the lower rates have affected consumer behavior. Is there a concern that there's just less potency on the business investment side that you're, in effect, pushing on a string? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think monetary policy works through the channels that we understand. I think the effects are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors, which are the ones-some of the ones that I mentioned. I think it's-I think interest rates are a factor in business investment, but I don't believe they're the main factor and main driver. And I think, you know, what one would like to see for-to support greater manufacturing activity, business investment, and exports would be a global recovery. And, you know, there's a lot of monetary policy accommodation and some fiscal accommodation, maybe, in the global economy now. Not here, but perhaps elsewhere. And that should turn-that should support growth in the global economy. And, again, resolution of our trade issues would contribute to that over time as well. CHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. You mentioned Fed Listens a couple of times, and what you've heard from people there about how it's benefited the disadvantaged or lower-income workers-the hot job market we have. Has the Fed thought about institutionalizing something like Fed Listens and maybe taking in some of this input from people that you don't always hear from-things like the Beige Book focus on businesses? Has there been thought of bringing in folks, say, from community groups more regularly? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. We think-we think that Fed Listens has been a great success for us, and I'm sure we will repeat it. In fact, I would imagine that this entire monetary policy review will become institutionalized and be done every few years. I would say this: In the Beige Book, we talk to educational institutions, health-care institutions, community groups, labor groups-it's not just businesses. And, by the way, all of those groups are also represented on the boards of our regional banks. We also meet quite regularly at the Board with representatives of low- and moderate-income communities. And so we're-we're very conscious of-you know, that we represent all Americans, and we need to hear all of their perspectives. That's why we-you know, we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but we also talk about groups that haven't experienced that yet. And so we're-we try to remind ourselves that we serve everybody. STEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. You mentioned housing and today's GDP data. When you look at that, do you believe that you have achieved a soft landing or are achieving a soft landing, in the sense that we're moving to trend growth for the rest of the year and next year? CHAIR POWELL. So that is-our outlook overall is for moderate growth of around 2 percent, which is pretty close to trend. That's our outlook: could be better, could be worse. You know, it's-you never say you've achieved it. But that's our outlook. And we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate as long as that remains broadly our outlook. DONNA BORAK. Donna Borak with CNN. Chair Powell, setting aside market expectations for today's rate cut-obviously, 97 percent sort of expected that this would happen today-can you tell us a little bit more about the rationale behind moving at this particular meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in December, and if there was any discussion about that around the table? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. I think this seems to be the right movement. You can see that we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views. But, in the end, we had a strong vote in favor of this action. I strongly believe it's the right action. I strongly believe that the actions we've taken over the course of this year have been the right things to do for this economy and are supporting economic growth and will do so in the future. So- GREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chairman Powell, it seems that the differences all across the country-that different regions are reacting differently to the China trade, and some regions are much weaker than others. There's this urban versus rural divide, the coasts versus the middle of the country. How does that factor into your policy decisions? CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's-monetary policy is famously a blunt instrument. So we can't-obviously, we can't raise interest rates some place and lower them other places. But we're very conscious. The first thing to know is to understand that, that-and we've called that out, as you, I'm sure, know, in one of our recent Monetary Policy Reports to Congress. The sort of rural-urban disparities in-you know, in employment, in growth, in all kinds of things, in health outcomes. You know, it's a big and growing difference-set of differences. We don't really have, you know, the tools to address that, but we call things out that are important to our economy that we may not be-that we might have-may not have the right tools to best address them, but we call them out because, you know, we're spending all of our time with the economy, and those are issues that maybe have to be addressed by legislatures and, you know, by-at the national level and at the state level. GREG ROBB. Oh, could I follow? Sorry, could I follow? Could-sorry. Just, so-so are you asking Congress to do something now, or will you ask them to do something down the road? CHAIR POWELL. I'm not asking Congress to do anything right now. I sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate. Let me put it this way: We do what we do, which is, we're assigned a job, which is maximum employment and stable prices. We do financial stability. We do bank regulation. The U.S. economy faces significant longer-term challenges around potential growth, around labor force participation, around disparities of income and wealth, around all kinds of things. And those are issues for Congress, and they're not issues for us. But if you really want the U.S. economy to be all it can be and raise the potential growth rate of the United States, you need-you need proper monetary policy. But, really, it isn't monetary policy. Really, it's fiscal policy that supports, you know, inclusive growth. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. I think you said, Chair Powell, that the primary positive development in risks to the outlook was on trade and, specifically, the prospects for a phase-one agreement with China. But, given the ups and downs of the trade dispute and that, you know, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned about developing monetary policy guidance, if you will, that's dependent a good part on the wins of the trade negotiations? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, I know, that's-I wouldn't-that's not how I would characterize it. I would just-I noted that it may be that there's been progress there toward-away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes, and it seems like there's the makings of a possible settlement there. I didn't say we're baking that in or anything, but I'm just noting that that's the case. As with Brexit-it's still quite uncertain what will be the result of the election and what the ultimate result will be. But I would say that the tail risk of a nonnegotiated no-deal Brexit seems to have decreased, just as I would say that the situation in our trade negotiations with China seems to have taken a step closer to resolution. That's all I'm saying. DON LEE. If I could follow up, if the phase-one agreement, then, doesn't work out, then would we be back at, you know, making, you know, monetary policy that- CHAIR POWELL. That's one factor among many, many factors that factor into our assessment of the outlook. And if we see-if we have-if we-if things happen that cause us to materially reassess the outlook, change our assessment of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly. VIRGINIE MONTET. Virginie Montet with the Agence France-Presse. Thank you. The Fed has pointed out many times in the past the rising inequality over those past decades and how that could be a factor behind sluggish growth. In light of the recent outcome of the strike at General Motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared growth in the long run? CHAIR POWELL. So, not for us to say what the appropriate labor arrangements will be. I will just say, on the General Motors strike, it's-it's likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter. That's likely to come back, maybe, over the first half of next year. And I think it's good to see it settled. But I'm not going to comment on what the appropriate labor arrangements are. That's a little bit far afield from our task here. Thank you. PAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. [Inaudible] Oh, I was wondering what that was. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thank you-thank you, Chairman. Wondering if you would categorize the current stance of monetary policy as accommodative, or if it's just, you know, that neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year. Secondly, you know, we're now two years removed from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and the economy is growing at about the same pace it was before-2 percent. So, given your mention of fiscal policy and the role it plays in supporting long-term growth, you know, is it fair to say that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked the way it was supposed to? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Sorry, say again what your first question was? I wrote it down, I can't- PAUL KIERNAN. Sorry-if policy is accommodative right now. CHAIR POWELL. Ah, yes. Okay. So if you look at where the federal funds rate is trading, it should be in the middle of, or maybe the lower half of, the range of 150 to 175. So that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero. I think my own sense would be that that's somewhat accommodative policy. I would say, though, that there's a range of plausible estimates of what the neutral rate of interest is, and I think many of those who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course of many years, and that process continues. But, nonetheless, that seems to me to be very likely to be an accommodative stance of policy, and an appropriate stance, given the situation we're in with continuing downside risks and-that I mentioned. So- JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung from Market News. I wanted to ask about financial stability risks. Recently, the IMF and some other global policymakers have been expressing concerns over the high level of risky corporate debt. So as rates get lower in the U.S. and around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risks and reach-for-yield? CHAIR POWELL. So we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all of the time. It's what we do since the financial crisis, as I've mentioned before. Currently, we don't see large imbalances. This long expansion is notable for the lack of large financial imbalances like the ones we've seen certainly before the crisis happened. So we have a four-part framework, I'll quickly mention. The first is leverage in the financial system, which is low by historical standards. The second is funding risk, which is the risk of runnable funding, and that risk is also quite low for banks but also for, you know, the nonbanking financial sector. If you look at asset prices, we see some high asset prices but not broadly across a range. We don't see bubbles and that kind of thing. And that leaves the fourth, which is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that's households and businesses. So with households, again, we don't see leverage. We see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the aggregate. Obviously, plenty of households are not in great shape financially, but in the aggregate, the household sector is in a very good place. That leaves businesses, which is where the issue has been. Leverage among corporations and other forms of business, private businesses, is historically high. We've been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate steps. So that's what I would say, but it's-corporate debt is one part of a larger part of our framework, and it is something that we're paying quite a bit of attention to. And it's been part of the last couple of Shared National Credit exams, and we've been monitoring it carefully and taking appropriate action. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Have the problems in the repo market led you to look into whether the liquidity and capital requirements for banks are too high? Is that something that the Fed might review? CHAIR POWELL. So we're-I think, again, I think the most important basic thing is to get the level of reserves back up so that-reserves move up and down with some volatility. We don't want them to move below the level they were at in the beginning of September, which is, again, between $1.45 and $1.5 trillion. That's the main thing, that's the first thing. And we're on a path to do that, between our temporary open market operations and also our bill purchases. In addition to that-in addition to that, we're looking at-there are-it's a big, complicated marketplace, and there was the-one of the surprises, as I mentioned, was that banks that had told us that their lowest comfortable level of reserves was here. They were well above that, and yet they didn't deploy that liquidity when there seemed to be great opportunities to do that. That didn't happen. So why is that? And so, we're doing careful analysis of that. You ask, would we lower capital and liquidity requirements because of this? I don't think so. I don't think that's where this goes. I think where it may go, though, is to look at, for example, intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing. It used to be a common thing for banks to have intraday liquidity from the Fed, what are called ""daylight overdrafts."" That's something we can look at. Also, there are just a few technical things that we can look at that would perhaps make the liquidity that we have-which we think is ample in the financial system-move more freely and be more liquid, if you will. And those are things we would do, but only if we can do it without compromising safety or soundness or financial stability. NAOATSU AOYAMA. Thank you very much, Chairman Powell. Naoatsu Aoyama from the Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper. Given this sustained level of low inflation, even in-even in this country, do you think-so there seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectations will remain going forward. So do you think a Japan-like situation, or ""Japanification"" of chronically low inflation and interest rates-the U.S. is getting trapped by the Japanification of this situation? Do you think so? CHAIR POWELL. So we-we, of course, have watched the situation in Japan and now the situation in Europe, and we-we note that there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world. And we don't think we're exempt from those. But, of course, if you look at our current inflation performance, it hasn't been anything like what we've seen in those other places. But we don't think-again, we don't think we're exempt from those pressures, and we are, therefore, strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at the level that is consistent with the symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. That's what we're committed to, and we'll use our tools to achieve. So we take-we take the risk very seriously. It's not-the risk isn't that inflation might run a couple tenths below 2 percent. The risk is that what we've seen is other economies getting on a disinflationary path, that it's been very hard for them to get off. Once inflation expectations start sliding down, inflation moves down. You have less-interest rates move down as well, because there's an inflation component in interest rates. And, you know, we think that the right thing to do is to do what we can now to hold and really move inflation expectations up so that they're squarely and firmly anchored at a level that's consistent with 2 percent inflation. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. Another type of balance sheet question, but not necessarily focused on the repo crunch-there was a discussion before that, that maybe we should move-or, rather, the Fed should move to a more neutral balance sheet, trying to remove some of the agency mortgage-backed securities that are on the balance sheet and maybe replace them with shorter-term Treasuries. Not any-I haven't really heard an update on the composure or the composition of the balance sheet for right now. I'm just wondering if the Fed is actively thinking about that right now, and, if so, when we might expect to hear something on that. CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's a-it's an issue, but it's not an issue that we're currently working on and-or reaching a decision on or anything like that. The question of the longer-run maturity composition of the balance sheet is a-is a big one, and it's one we'll return to over time, but not-not imminently. VIVIENNE NUNIS. Chairman Powell, this morning, the President tweeted that we're seeing the greatest economy in American history. I just wondered, as the Chair of America's central bank, what you made of that characterization. CHAIR POWELL. You know, I'm going to maintain my longtime practice of not-not commenting on anything any elected official would say, but thank you. VIVIENNE NUNIS. Okay, thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thanks very much."

"HOWARD SCHNEIDER. [Inaudible remark] Sorry-Howard Schneider with Reuters. Sorry about that. So I was struck by the, sort of, disconnect that exists here between the behavior of unemployment and inflation. You seem to have unemployment penciled in here now for three years running-more-underneath the longer-run level, yet inflation never really accelerates. So what are we to make of that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, that's-what's happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years. If you go back 50 years, you would have seen that, when there was-when labor markets were tight and unemployment was low, inflation moved right up. And then as the Fed got control of inflation, the connection got weaker and weaker and weaker, to the point where there's still a connection, but it's-it's a very faint one. And I-what that suggests is that you would need to keep policy somewhat accommodative. And we believe that policy is somewhat accommodative, and we think that that's the appropriate place for policy to be in order to drive up inflation. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that-I mean, it's faint to nonexistent, though, it seems to me, so this suggests that, really, your policy lever as it exists now isn't really influencing prices at all. So, in that case, what do you do to reach your target? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I don't think that's right. I mean, we-the-again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak. The coefficient is something like 0.1. So it's much, much lower than it used to be, but I don't know that it's gone down any more in the last decade. It just is quite faint. But it's still there. I mean, you can see it. If you look-look at where wages were three or four years ago, they were running around 2 percent. And now the whole group of different wage measures that we monitor has moved up to 3 and 3Â½ percent, and that suggests tightening. The same thing is true, but much less true, of inflation, the relationship between-in a way, the wage Phillips curve has a higher coefficient than the price Phillips curve does. But we do still see some relationship, and that's what you're seeing in those numbers. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, Steve Liesman CNBC. You've used the analogy to 1998 to describe the rate cuts we just went through, and I'm wondering if we can sort of continue the analogy. Within seven months of those '98 rate cuts, the Fed took them back and then some. So, were these those kind of rate cuts, the kind that you need to take back, or are we at a place now where we're at a neutral rate-""take back,"" I mean if those risks that you say we're cushioning from don't materialize in the way you think-or is this now a new sort of steady state for the economy at this rate, this is the right rate for the economy that you see going forward and don't need to take those rate cuts back? CHAIR POWELL. So there's similarities, conceptual similarities, I think, between the two instances during that long expansion, I guess in '95 and '98, when the Fed cut three times only to resume raising rates. And the notion just is that it's a-the economy needed slightly more accommodative policy, but it wasn't the end of the expansion, right? And that's the same situation we believe we're in here. So this is that we did, in fact, turn out to do three rate cuts. That wasn't in the plan, you know, in any kind of specific way at the beginning. So that's the same. What's different is, you have a very different-you have very different structural characteristics in the economy, particularly around inflation. So now, as you can see, inflation is barely moving up, notwithstanding that unemployment is at 50-year lows and expected to remain there. So the need for rate increases is less. And, by the way, this is-it's a good thing that, you know, we think we can-I think we've learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation. In fact, we need some upward pressure on inflation to get back to 2 percent. It's quite different in '95 and '98 when there were those two adjustments. So, I would say, similarities and differences. MICHAEL MCKEE. The BIS concluded in-I did the same thing as Howard. Michael McKee, Bloomberg radio and television. The BIS concluded in September that the repo spike was not a one-off confluence of random events but reflected structural and regulatory issues that could lead to a recurrence. I'd like to ask you if you agree with the BIS findings. And, given that we're approaching year-end for the markets, will you be taking any extra steps to ensure that funding is available in the repo and FX swaps markets? There was a report yesterday from Credit Suisse suggesting there's a good chance that we will see disruptions, and one of the reasons they put for it is that the Fed is at this point buying only T-bills, and the market wants to sell coupons. Do you have any plans to sell coupons? CHAIR POWELL. So I'm going to take a little step back, and I will-I will get to your specific questions on the year-end and on T-bills. So I guess I want to start by stressing that these are very important operational matters but that are not likely to have any macroeconomic implications. We'd decided back in January to remain an ample-reserves regime, and that means we will be setting the federal funds rate-the range for the federal funds rate through our administered rates and not through active management of the level of reserves. We're committed to robustly implementing that framework, as you can see by our actions. And the purpose of all this, let's remember, is to assure that our monetary policy decisions will be transmitted to the federal funds rate, which in turn affects other short-term rates. We have the tools to accomplish that, and we will use them. The purpose of all this is not to eliminate all volatility, particularly in the repo market. So, taking you back, this-as you know, we had very gradually allowed the balance sheet to shrink, we slowed that gradual pace by half in March, and then we ended it in July. Meanwhile, we had surveyed all of the banks, and particularly the large banks who hold a lot of the reserves, and said, ""What's your lowest comfortable level of reserves?"" We got those numbers, we added them up, we added a buffer, and it came out sort of at a level that was well below where we were in September. And yet we saw, actually, in September that reserves-the markets acted as though reserves had become scarce. So what had happened was that liquidity, which actually existed, didn't flow into the repo market, and that had effects on the federal funds rate. So the question is, why did that happen? And we've been very carefully looking at the reasons why that might have happened. There are-there are payments issues, there have been a number of supervisory and regulatory issues raised-we're looking carefully at those. We're open to ideas for modifying supervisory and regulatory practice in ways that don't undermine safety and soundness, and a number of ideas are under-under examination there. To go through it sort of by-in time, we started off, really, on September 17 with overnight operations. By October 11 we had created and put into effect a plan. That plan is in effect. It's working. I think, for the last couple of months, repo markets have been functioning well, short-term rates are stable, markets are functioning. So you asked about year-end. Temporary upward pressures on short-term money market rates are not unusual around year-end. And our-both our repo operations and Treasury bill purchases are intended to mitigate the risks that such pressures pose to our control of the federal funds rate. We think that the pressures appear manageable, and we stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as necessary to keep the federal funds rate in the target range. Our strategy has been-essentially, the key to our strategy is to supply reserves in the near term through-through both overnight and term repo, and, at the same time, we're raising the underlying level of reserves through bill purchases. I'll take that now. We've said bills-bill purchases. We've also said that we were willing to adapt our strategy. We're not at this place, but if it does become appropriate for us to purchase other short-term coupon securities, then we would be prepared to do that if-if the need arises. So-but we don't-we don't-we're not in that place. It looks-it very much looks like the bill-so those bill purchases are going well, just according to expectations. I mean, the other thing I'll say is that we're in, you know, very regular contact with market participants all the time. We'll be providing-we'll be continuing that, and we're prepared to adjust our tactics. We're-we're focused on-on year-end as well and prepared to adjust our operations as appropriate. MICHAEL MCKEE. The follow-up to that would be, where are we with the possibility of a standing repo facility? CHAIR POWELL. So, on the standing repo facility, as you know, we've actually had a couple of meetings where we've discussed that. I think the standing repo facility is something that'll take some time to evaluate and create the parameters of and put into place. At the moment what we're focused on is, you know-we're now focused on year-end. I should also mention that after the year-end, the sense of it is that as the underlying level of reserves moves up because of bill purchases, as that happens, there will come a time when it will be appropriate for overnight and term repo to gradually decline. We don't know-we can't know today what the timing of that will be, but that's the way-that's the way we see it going over time. HEATHER LONG. Heather Long from the Washington Post. A number of your colleagues have said explicitly that they do not think the FOMC should raise interest rates until core inflation is back at 2 percent. They think there should be a rule. Where do you personally stand on that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, as I mentioned, actually, at the last press conference, we think our policy rate is appropriate and will remain appropriate as long as incoming data are broadly in keeping with our-with our outlook. And in order to move rates up, I would want to see inflation that's persistent and that's significant-a significant move-up in inflation that's also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns. That's my view. HEATHER LONG. So is this de facto policy of the Committee then? I guess I'm wondering why it's not sort of codified in a statement. CHAIR POWELL. We haven't-we haven't tried to turn it into some sort of, you know, official forward guidance. It happens to be my view that that's what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. Just following up on Heather's question-so if you look at the SEP today, it looks like inflation is never overshooting 2 percent and is only getting up to 2 percent by the end of 2021, yet rates are increasing in 2021. So, I guess, how do we square that circle, with interest rates increasing before inflation ever really moves up in some meaningful overshooting way? CHAIR POWELL. I think what you're seeing is, you've got a full year of the median being flat, which is, we think, accommodative, modestly accommodative, and inflation not moving up very much, as we've discussed. And that underscores, I think, the challenge of getting inflation to move up. The Committee has wanted inflation to be at 2 percent, squarely at 2 percent, for-ever since I arrived in 2012. And it hasn't happened, and it's just-it's because there are disinflationary forces around the world, and they've been stronger than, I think, people understood them to be. In terms of those out-year rate increases, what's you're-you're looking at rate increases more than a year into the future, and, you know, people will have their own explanations for why they do that, but we-really, none of us have much of a sense of what the economy will be like in 2021. So I think what may be behind some of that is just the thought that, over time, it would be appropriate-if you believe that the neutral rate is 2Â½ percent, it would be appropriate for your rates to move up in that direction. I will also say to you that a number of people wrote down, and you can't see this at this level of detail, but-today-but a number of people did write down overshoots of inflation as appropriate-under appropriate policy. BRENDAN GREELEY. Brendan Greeley from the Financial Times. Given that inflation-whichever measure you choose-has either sort of remained where it is or not increased over the past year as you've been dropping the policy rate, what is it that gives you confidence that the Fed has the tools to get inflation back up to target or even overshoot as you just indicated that some people are considering doing? CHAIR POWELL. Well, it's just that there is still, empirically, by many, many different-by the work of many different analysts, there is a relationship between resource utilization, by which I mean unemployment, and inflation. It's just relatively weak. And, by the way, that's not a bad thing. That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good-in some dimensions-labor market without having to worry about inflation. It also means, though, that it's not easy to move inflation up. Now, you say, why is there confidence? I mean, I would say there's more humility than there is confidence in this at this point. It's been very challenging to get inflation to be at target. If you look around the world, the United States, of all major economies, has been closest to it but still hasn't quite been able to achieve it. And I would also point out that this year, which has been a good year for the economy, inflation-core inflation is actually running at 1.6 percent, whereas it ran close to 2 percent most of last year. So it's-it's a real challenge, and-but I think we're using our tools as best we can to meet that challenge. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. So, Chair Powell, I want to ask about the framework review, which obviously entails some kind of debate around allowing an overshoot of the 2 percent target. And in that-in that context, is merely saying that you want inflation to rise above 2 percent a sufficient strategy for getting inflation to stay at the target, or would it compel some kind of policy action beyond deferring future rate increases to achieve that outcome if that's the direction in which the Committee goes? In other words, it's one thing to accept inflation rising on its own opportunistically. But if inflation does not materialize, would a change in the framework necessarily make it easier to generate higher inflation? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I-you know, I think the answer to the question of whether saying it is enough to create credibility, the answer to that is ""no."" And I think you have to back that up with policy that supports the outcome, and that's what we're trying to do. And so the-the changes that we're looking at to the framework are-I think they take all of that on board, and-but they're-what they're-what they are designed to do is to strengthen the credibility of that-of that inflation target, but only if followed by policy. Ultimately, it will take time to establish-to move inflation expectations up from where they are, which appears to be a bit below 2 percent, will not happen overnight. It'll have to happen over time as credibility is built. You know, the Fed has great inflation credibility, but inflation expectations are anchored at about their 25-year average, which is a few ticks below 2 percent. EDWARD LAWRENCE. We talked a lot about inflation-Edward Lawrence from Fox Business Network. We talked a lot about inflation. I want to ask you about uncertainty. With the House announcing that they will ratify USMCA and Canada and Mexico signing off on it, do you see that uncertainty easing now so the business investment could pick up, or are the trade tensions with China just that big elephant in the room where you might not see those business investments pick up? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I did see the news today that it appears there's an agreement to move forward to vote on USMCA, and, of course, it's not our role to comment on particular trade policies or criticize them one way or the other or evaluate them. I will say, though, that getting-if the deal were to be enacted, then it would certainly remove some of the trade policy uncertainty, and that would be, I believe, a positive for the economy. And I'll say the same thing about the negotiations with China, which haven't reached that point yet. We've been hearing from our people that we talked to-the many, many people and businesses that we talked to in-through the Reserve Banks that wind up being written up in the Beige Book, and they've been telling us all year-for a year and a half, really, that trade policy uncertainty is weighing on the outlook. And I do think that, again, without commenting on it-in any way on the process or the content of the agreement, I think that uncertainty-removal of uncertainty around that would be a positive for the economy as well. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Is one uncertainty bigger than the other? Is-do you see-not commenting on the deals themselves, is one uncertainty- CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think you can-you know, it's-I think you can see that what's been moving-one way to look at it is, what's been moving financial markets? It's been news about the negotiations with China, not so much USMCA. I think the difference between NAFTA and USMCA is-is smaller than the difference between current, you know, arrangements with China and what's being negotiated. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg. Chair Powell, the Fed policy review this year has largely been discussed in terms of the inflation side of the mandate and the need to shore up inflation expectations. But it seems like the message you've been getting from the Fed Listens events and also something else you've recently acknowledged is that, you know, the Fed has also been systematically overestimating labor utilization throughout this expansion. So I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the extent to which the review is looking at the employment side of the mandate as well. Are there any possibilities, you know, for perhaps systematizing a more asymmetric reaction function with regard to unemployment? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So the-you know, the focus really is on how to use our strategies, tools, and communications to achieve both sides of the mandate. And you're right, though, that we've talked here a lot about inflation. And I think that the-I think, more broadly, over a period of years-many years-we've been learning that the natural rate of unemployment is lower. It's just been-it's in estimates not just at the Fed, but among-broadly among economists-labor economists have seen that the connection-that we can sustain much lower levels of unemployment than had been thought. And, as I mentioned, that's a good thing because that means we-we don't have to worry so much about inflation. And that's-and you see the benefits of that in today's labor market. I-you know, the Fed Listens events are about inflation to a much lesser extent than they are about maximum employment. If you've-if you've listened to or attended any of those, the discussion-we always focus on inflation as well, but the discussion is really around what's happening in low- and moderate-income communities and among small businesses. And I think you-you get a perspective, which-you know, we were already getting that from our extensive outreach to community groups and such. But it was help to get-helpful to get it in the context of a monetary policy review. And I think that the fact that these communities have so much-such high levels of unemployment and low levels of labor force participation tells you that there is slack out there. And I think that does also inform our understanding of what we mean by ""maximum employment."" And it's been a very positive-I would say that the Fed Listens events have been-have been extraordinarily positive, and they're certainly something we'll repeat. You also see from the business perspective that companies are taking all kinds of measures to-you know, to look through things on people's rÃ©sumÃ©s that would have perhaps disqualified them in other kinds of environments, training is moving up-you hear just a lot-there are a lot of things going on that suggest that people at the margins of the labor force are being pulled in and being given chances, which is a great thing. MATTHEW BOESLER. Thanks. Sorry, if I could just follow up briefly-is there any way to sort of systematize these insights, do you think, with, you know, in terms of-we talk a lot about, for example, makeup strategies on the inflation side. Is there anything similar you could do on the employment side? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I-I think we have kind of internalized-and this isn't-this isn't news for today, this is something we've been saying for, you know, for several years-you've seen us moving down our estimates of the-of maximum employment. In fact, it's already-it's already understood, I think, that-that there's more-even though we're at 3Â½ percent unemployment, there's actually more slack out there, in a sense. And-and the risks of, you know, using accommodative monetary policy, our tool, to explore that are relatively low. And I think we know that, and I think the review certainly underscores that, but that's-that's a very important insight. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask more about the-the repo issues and what you all are doing beyond open market operations. Are you currently, for example, telling examiners not to prefer reserves over Treasuries for supervisory purposes? Are you talking to the Treasury Department about maybe reducing the level of volatility in their account at the Fed? And on the standing repo facility, is it, you know, that you would be inclined to do it, but you need to figure out the details? Or-or what would kind of drive the decision on whether or not to do that? CHAIR POWELL. So, on Treasuries versus reserves, we've done a ton of work on that. We've talked to supervisors, and-it's interesting, if you look at the banks, they're all over the place on the composition of their-of their buffer. So you have to have-you have a business model, and that business model suggests what your stress outflows will be, and that suggests what your buffer should be. And you see them making quite different choices. Some of them have lots of reserves and, you know, fewer Treasuries, and then they change their mind and they switch, so it's not obvious that there's one thing happening there. Notwithstanding that, we have-we've gone out to try to understand that, talking to supervisors. In terms of the-the TGA, you know, we have not tried to pull the TGA into this yet; we've taken it as exogenous. I don't know that at some point we won't have those discussions, but, you know, Treasury-we want Treasury to be able to have the cash that it needs. And then we should-we are essentially taking that as exogenous to our-to our work. And, you know, there may come a time when we-when we talk about that, but we haven't done much of that. Standing repo facility-so your question on that is, what are we thinking about it? What are we-I mean, I-so I think we're-we are more focused, frankly, on the T-the bill purchases, the year-end, and also the review of supervisory and regulatory issues that we're digging into, and-because we think, you know, there's-these are structural things-right?-where you could, without sacrificing safety and soundness, just allow the-allow the liquidity that is already there to flow more freely, perhaps by making fairly straightforward, noncontroversial changes. And we think there is some of that, though-and so we're working hard and fast. But those are things, you know, the-if they take rule changes, it'll take, you know, a notice of public rulemaking-it'll take three months and things like that. Those things take time. These things that we're working on now, though-like, you know, going through year-end with the overnight facilities and the bill purchases and the term repo-those are-those are things we have to do right now and are doing. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi, Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. I wanted to ask, the only change in the statement was a drop in the reference to uncertainties around the economy. You seem very confident that-or it implies there's a lot of confidence that those uncertainties have gone away. What caused you to make that change for the statement? What were you looking at that seemed to be so much lower? CHAIR POWELL. Well, we did, actually-if you look at the statement, you'll notice that we-we did call out global developments and muted inflation pressures later in the statement. And why did we do that? You know, those are the things that we've been monitoring all year. We've put now in place policies that we think are appropriate to address those things, so we're not revisiting that. But those are-those are just key things, and they haven't gone away, so we thought it was appropriate to mention them there-still subject to the idea that, for us to change our stance, we would want to see a material reassessment of the outlook. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Well, just to follow real quick, on the material-material reassessment aspect, are you worried that that has set too high a bar for potential cuts next year? We were talking about rate hikes, but no-no Fed policymaker seems to foresee any cuts next year. Some economists do. Does a material reassessment mean you need to see data actually worsen? Does it reduce your ability to act preemptively the way, arguably, you did this year? CHAIR POWELL. So, I mean, one thing that we're mindful of is that we've cut rates three times since July. That's 75 basis points' worth of cuts. And we do believe that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags, and that it will take some time before the full effects of those actions are seen in the economy. So that'll take some time. So that's one reason to hold back and-and wait. And we thought-I think we took strong measures. In fact, if you look at-more broadly at the Treasury yield curve, it has moved more than 75 basis points. So you've-you've had quite a significant move in the direction of higher accommodation. In terms of what's-you know, what is material at the end of the day, well, I would just say, whether or not a change in the outlook merits a policy response will be a collective judgment of the FOMC. There isn't any single factor that will determine our decisions. We'll-we'll look at a full range of data and other information bearing on the economic outlook. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you Mr. Chairman, Scott Horsley for NPR. You started out by talking about Paul Volcker, who obviously cast a-a long shadow. I wonder if, in hindsight, that shadow was-was too long, and if-in the decades since his tenure and, in particular, last year, if the Fed was too quick to raise interest rates to attack an inflation bogeyman that didn't materialize. CHAIR POWELL. So I-this wouldn't be a-my response will not be about Paul Volcker, but-so, well, you started with Paul Volcker. So, if you look back at 2018-I'll just take you back to the beginning of 2018. We had an economy growing at 3 percent, we had inflation at 2 percent, and we had a trillion and a half dollars' worth of stimulus arriving, and the federal funds rate was 1.4 percent. So it wasn't that-so we moved-we moved policy up during the course of the year. We never got policy even at the level of what we thought the neutral rate was at the time. So there was no sense of it being restrictive. We took steps to make it less accommodative, and that seemed to be the right thing. It still seems to me to be the right thing in hindsight. The idea that we were trying to, you know, slow the economy down-we were really just trying to get near neutral. And even with the last rate increase a year ago, we were still meaningfully below the median estimate on the Committee of what the neutral rate was. So policy was always accommodative during the course of that year. I think what's happened is, the-obviously, the facts on the ground have changed. You saw the global economic slowdown begin in the middle of last year, gather force, and then continue to go on this year, so you've seen a continual weakening. Just look at the IMF's forecasts of growth from, you know, the spring of 2018 and compare them to now. You've had quite a significant-that does affect us. I think, also, the trade situation was just beginning in the middle of '18, and I think it had-has had-you know, I think there'll be a very, very wide range of estimates of the effect, but I think it's had a meaningful effect on output just through the uncertainty channel and, to a lesser extent, through-through, you know, the tariff effects. And, again, that's not to make a judgment. It's not up to us to make a judgment about that. So, that's what-that would be my story. DONNA BORAK. Chair Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. To follow up on Edward's trade question, could you talk about what you would imagine the economic effect would be if negotiations with China were to fall apart and how the Fed might be able to support the economy in that event? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I wouldn't want to speculate on-on a hypothetical. I would say-we'll just have to see. We're-we look at a range of factors and we've-as I've said before, we try to look through the volatility in trade news and trade negotiations. We try not to react. We can't react. Monetary policy is not the right tool to react in the very short term to volatility and, you know, things that can change back and forth and back and forth as this has happened, as is probably typical of a-of a large complex negotiation. So, in terms of-you know, I-again, I don't want to get into hypothetical outcomes, though, if that's all right. DONNA BORAK. I'm just wondering, you met with the President last month. Did you have any advice for him when it came to this, and did you express some concerns about the potential volatility and the impact of the economy on-given all this? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I-I'm going to stick with my and my predecessors' longtime practice of not discussing private meetings with elected officials-or other officials, really. But thank you. VIRGINIE MONTET. Thank you. Virginie Montet with Agence France-Presse. Yesterday, Democratic leaders in the House have launched an impeachment process against the President. Have you mentioned these developments within the Committee, as-today as potentially presenting some risks for their confidence in the economy? CHAIR POWELL. No. We have not. We don't consider things like that. MICHAEL DERBY. Mike Derby with Dow Jones Newswires. Does the Fed's dot plot still serve a useful communications purpose, or do you feel that it might be time to retire it or change it in some fashion? CHAIR POWELL. With-I think properly understood, it can be useful, but that's been a challenge. You know, I think ""properly understood"" to me means looking at what it is and not at what it isn't. And what it is is, it's an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy. Remember that we write all that down, and we send it in, and it gets compiled. But we don't discuss it at the meeting, and we don't negotiate a plan. There is no-there's no agreement. There's no plan. And I think, particularly at inflection points, it's hard to convey the reality, which is that policy is always going to depend on the economic outlook and changes in the economic outlook. And when the economic outlook is changing, the dots are-they're just not a consideration. We're going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy. And if the fact-dots that we did six months ago or three months ago don't agree with that, that's not even in the conversation. So its more-but it can it be useful if-and I think-but, as I said, it's been a challenge, and so I-I do-I do like to say, if you focus too much on the dots, you can-you can miss the broader picture. GREG ROBB. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Chairman Powell, many people seem worried that the framework that you guys are working on is going to be-the results are going to be less rather than more. And I-people keep coming back and saying why-asking why you took off, like, a 4 percent inflation rate off the table even when it started. I mean, as you said, going around the country for all the Listen events, I don't think I heard anybody worry about a 4 percent inflation rate or think that a higher inflation rate was going to be a problem. So where does that concern come from? Is it members of Congress that have-have said this? CHAIR POWELL. No. So let me say, we're-we've been working on this all year. And we're just at the stage where we've had a really interesting discussion about the various tools that we have at the October meeting. At this meeting, we talked about the way monetary policy affects different groups in the economy. So we had a-we talked about the Fed Listens events and some very interesting research. So we're just getting to the stage where we're looking at conclusions. You know, what do we take away from all this? And those things-many of those things would wind up as changes, if you will, modifications to the ""Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy."" I think that process will take until the middle of the year where-but we want to approach it very thoroughly and very carefully. And that is-in effect, that is our framework document. And I wouldn't prejudge. No one-I believe we will be able to-to reach a successful conclusion and make meaningful improvements. I do. In terms of ""4 percent""-so that's-I think it's premature for people to be saying that this isn't going anywhere. You know-and if you define going anywhere as a 4 percent inflation target-let me talk about the 4 percent inflation target. So I'll go back to the point that just saying words is not itself credible. So I think if you said, ""We're raising the inflation target to 4,"" what would be the effect of that? I mean, where's the credibility in that, really? You haven't been able to get it to 2. So I think we-I think you need to lower your sights a little bit. I also think, is 4 percent-you'd have to ask the question, is that really, you know, price stability? Is that really price stability? Is that within our legal mandate? I mean, I think it's a fair question. So, you know, I think-I'd like for this review to come out with very-a set of positive results-you know, meaningful improvements. It doesn't mean it has to solve every problem going forward. We want to-we want to have this be a successful exercise where we meaningfully improve our monetary policy framework. These things don't tend to move in-you know, in a lurchy way, they tend to evolve. But I think-and if we do this, then in a few years, again and again and things like that, then we can-at least we're moving in a good direction. And I think we will be. I'm confident we will be. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. Chair Powell, you've had a busy year, and I'm wondering, as you look back, what things you might have done differently. And are there any lessons that you would take into next year? CHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, I have to say, my total focus is on right now and getting policy right and thinking about next year-you know, thinking about what's the economy going to be doing. I like where we are on policy, as I mentioned. I think our policy stance is appropriate and likely to remain so as long as the outlook is broadly like this. You know-I mean, it's too long of a question. You know, I don't know how to get after that. There's-there's a lot of learning that comes into-from the economy every year and in the way we do our jobs. And, you know, we're always going to be trying to learn lessons. DON LEE. I mean, are there any particular surprises, whether it's the economy or how markets or financial- CHAIR POWELL. Well, I-so, yes. I didn't-obviously, you know, didn't see and I don't think anybody saw coming the-the challenges that we faced this year. I think they were a surprise. I think that, toward the end of 2018, there was still a sense the economy was growing at around 3 percent. And I didn't expect the-to face the challenges, but I think we did face them, and I think we-I'm pleased that we moved to support the economy in the way that we did. I think our moves will prove appropriate. And, again, I think both the economy and monetary policy right now, I think, are in a good place. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. I'm Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace. Chair Powell, why aren't we seeing stronger wage gains? Wages are growing more slowly now than they were toward the beginning of the year. Why is that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, wage gains have moved up a bit. If you look back three, four years, you'll see wages are growing around 2 percent. Now you see them moving up, you know, more at 3, 3Â½ percent. So why aren't they growing higher, at a faster rate? And it's a couple of things. I think there are a range of explanations. For instance, one would be that productivity has just been low. So wages should go up to cover inflation and productivity. Productivity has been low, and that-that is very likely to be holding back wages. I also think there are other possible potential explanations, such as, you know, globalization can be-the idea that you can make, manufacture, or even provide services anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. I think that hangs over the wage-setting process-and everywhere, pretty much. You don't see-there isn't the kind of traction in the wage market that-even in a tight labor market. Another thing is, though, that the labor market may not be as tight as we had thought it was. And, you know, I think there-there are many, many possible explanations. I will say, though, if you look, for example, at nonsupervisory employees in the labor report, there are-their wages are going up at 3.7 percent. And so, you do see-and wages are going up the most for people at the lower end of the-that's been true for the last couple of years-lower end of the wage spectrum. So you do see wages moving up. It's just-they're not moving up at-at very high rates. And, again, at the end of the day, that probably has most to do with productivity. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Can I ask a quick follow-up? Just as far as the market not being as tight as you thought, are you saying there are still more people on the sidelines who could join the labor force? CHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. And I would also say that we-if you ask people, and we did ask people, what do you think the natural rate of unemployment is? People were writing down numbers in the fives, and then they were writing down numbers in the fours. And now, unemployment has been in the threes for a year and a half, and we still see wage inflation, as you mentioned. The level of wage inflation has actually moved down, although, there may be compositional effects in that number that may-that may be, to some extent, about younger workers coming in at lower wages that-than retiring workers. But you wouldn't-that shouldn't have much of an effect, actually. So why is that? It may just be that there's more slack in the economy. And I think we are seeing that. We're seeing-really, it showed up through higher participation. For many years, we've thought that there's a trend decline in participation. Notwithstanding that, against that trend, we've seen prime-age participation moving up pretty steadily over the last two or three years. And it's a very positive thing, but it does sort of provide more labor supply, meaning a less tight labor market. HANNAH LANG. Hi. Hannah Lang with American Banker. Thanks for being here today. I just wanted to ask about the Community Reinvestment Act, since the FDIC and OCC may potentially join together with a-for a proposal without the Fed. Are you concerned that this might cause confusion, and how would the mechanics work if this proposal is finalized without the Fed? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, we think the CRA-we know the CRA is a very important law, and we're strongly committed to the mission of ensuring that banks provide credit to their-throughout their communities, particularly addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households and neighborhoods. We also think it's time for modernization. We've thought that for some time, and we worked very hard to try to get aligned with the OCC, really, on-on a proposal. And my hope is that we can still do that. You know, I don't know whether that'll be possible or not. It will have to-well, we'll just have to see, but-and if we-if we can't, I don't-I'm not sure what the path forward would be. We would certainly not want to create confusion or, you know, sort of tension between the regimes if they do turn out to be slightly different regimes. So that's something we-I hope we don't have to face, but we will if we have to. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. So, before the July meeting, you said something kind of colorful. You said, ""To call something 'hot,' you would need to see some heat,"" referring to the labor market. So to expand a bit, I guess, on Nancy's question, it seems like the wage Phillips curve has been pretty well explored already, but what would you need to see to call the labor market ""hot"" in that case? Would it be a contract-or, rather, some sort of change in either the headline number of gains or in the unemployment rate? CHAIR POWELL. Really, wages. I mean, we-there's so many other measures that suggest that the labor market is-I like to say the labor market is strong. I don't really want to say that it's tight. Someone asked me a question about a hot labor market-that was in the Humphrey-Hawkins hearings. So I'll say that the labor market is strong. I don't know that it's tight, because you're not seeing wage increases, you know. Ultimately, if it's tight, those should be-should be reflected in higher wage increases, so it does come down to that. You know, we look at countless measures of labor market-you know, labor utilization, and there's so many-it's too many to count. But the one that has-that is kind of suggesting that you're-it's a healthy number that, you know, the sort of 3.1 percent average hourly earnings number is a decent number-3.7 percent for production and nonsupervisory workers is more healthy. Ultimately, though, we'd like to see-to call it ""hot,"" you'd want to see heat. You'd want to see, you know, higher wages. Thanks."
