"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thank you for taking our questions. I was hoping that you would first react to the wild ride that game stock-GameStop's stock has had this week. And then, secondarily, you and your colleagues have repeatedly made it clear that you really plan to use macroprudential tools as the first line of defense when it comes to financial stability risks. But your macroprudential tools primarily apply to the banks. I'm wondering what your plan is, if you see some sort of large financial stability risk emanating from the nonbank financial sector in the coming months, especially as it relates to search-for-yield kind of activities. You know, what, what do you see as the solution there? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So, on, on your first question, I don't want to comment on a particular company or, or day's market activity or things like that. It's just not really something that I would typically comment on. In terms of macroprudential policy tools, so, as you know, no doubt, we rely on sort of always-on, through-the-cycle macroprudential policy tools, particularly the stress tests and also the elevated levels of liquidity and capital and, and, and also resolution planning that we-that we impose on the largest financial institutions. We don't use time-varying tests and tools as some other countries do. And we think it's a good approach because-for us to use ones that are always-on-because we don't really think we'd be successful in every case in picking the exact right time to intervene in markets. So that's for banks. You really asked about nonbanks, the nonbank sector. And so we monitor financial conditions very broadly. And while we don't have jurisdiction over, over many areas in the nonbank sector, other agencies do. And so we do coordinate through the Financial Stability Oversight Council and with other agencies who have responsibility for, for nonbank supervision. And, in fact, as you know, in the last crisis, the banking system held up fairly well so far. And, and the dislocations that we saw from the outsized economic and financial shock of the pandemic really appeared in the nonbank sector. So that's-right now we are engaged in, in carefully examining, understanding, and thinking about what, what in the nonbank sector will need to be addressed in the next year or so. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi, FT. JAMES POLITI. Thank you so much, Michelle and Chair Powell. I had a question on fiscal policy. Last year you consistently said that the economy needed more fiscal support and, I believe, were pleased when the $900 billion package was approved in December. We have-now have a new, new President, a new Congress. We have a weakening short-term outlook. Do you believe the economy still needs additional support on the fiscal side? And in what areas? CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So I guess I'd start by saying that the, the fiscal response that we've seen to this downturn has been strong, and I think we can say now that it's been sustained after the passage of the-of the, the most recent act in, in late December. And that's really a key reason why the recovery has been as strong as it's been. Fiscal policy has been absolutely essential. When we look back on, on the history of this period, we'll see a strong and sustained fiscal policy response. I would-I would add that we're, as I mentioned, a long way from a full recovery. Something like 9 million people remain unemployed as a consequence of the pandemic. That's as many people as lost their jobs at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis and the Great Recession. Many small businesses are under pressure, and there are other needs to be addressed. And the path ahead is still pretty uncertain. So, all of that said, the judgment on how much to spend and in what way is really one for Congress and the Administration and not for the Fed. And these discussions are going on right now. So there's a discussion, as you know, right now around, around those precise questions, and, and that's appropriate, but not for us to play a role in talking about specific policies. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if I could follow up on Jeanna's question here. I understand that you do address issues of, of valuations through macroprudential policies in the first instance, but there's a range of assets. And I know you do watch a range of assets. But from Bitcoin to corporate bonds to the stock market in general to some of these more specific meteoric rises in stocks like GameStop, how do you address the concern that super easy monetary policy-asset purchases and zero interest rates-are potentially fueling a bubble that could cause economic fallout should it burst? CHAIR POWELL. Let me-let me provide a little context. The shock that the-from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity. There's nothing close to it in our modern economic history. So our response was really to that. And we-we've done what we could, first, to restore market function and to provide a bit of relief, then to support the recovery. And, hopefully, we'll be able to do the third thing, which is to avoid longer-run damage to the-to the economy. Our role assigned by Congress is maximum employment and stable prices and also look after financial stability. So, in a world where, almost a year later, we're, we're still 9 million jobs, at least-that's one way of counting it; it can actually be counted much higher than that-short of maximum employment and people are out of the labor force who were in the labor force-the real unemployment rate is close to 10 percent if you include people that've left the labor force-it's very much appropriate that monetary policy be highly accommodative to support maximum employment and price stability, which is getting inflation back to 2 percent and averaging 2 percent over time. So, on, on matters of financial stability, we have a framework. We don't look at one thing or two things. We look at-and we made that framework public after the financial crisis so that it could be criticized and understood and we could be held accountable. And, you know, the things that we look at are-we do look at asset prices. We also look at leverage in the banking system. We look at leverage in the non-the nonbanking system, which is to say, corporates and households. And we look at also funding risk. And if you look at it across that range of, of, of readings, they're each different, but we monitor them carefully. And I would say that financial stability vulnerabilities overall are moderate. Our overall goal is to assure that the financial system itself is resilient to, to shocks of all kinds, that it's strong and resilient. And that includes not just the banks, but money market funds and, and all different kinds of nonbank financial structures as well. So when we get to the nonfinancial sector, we don't-we don't have jurisdiction over that. But-so I would just say that our-that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices. So if you look at what's really been driving asset prices, really, in the last couple of months, it isn't monetary policy. It's been expectations about vaccines. And it's also financial-sorry, fiscal policy. Those are-those are the news items that have been driving, driving asset purchases-sorry, asset values in, in recent months. So I, I know that monetary policy does play a role there, but that's how we look at it. And I think, you know, I think that the connection between low interest rates and, and asset values is probably something that's not as tight as people think, because a lot of-a lot of different factors are driving asset prices at any given time. STEVE LIESMAN. Can I follow up, Michelle, if you don't mind? Mr. Chairman, do you rule out or see as one of your tools in the toolkit the idea of adjusting monetary policy to address asset values? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, that's-as you know, that's one of the very difficult questions in all of monetary policy. And we don't rule it out as a theoretical matter, but we, we clearly look to macroprudential tools, regulatory tools, supervisory tools, other kinds of tools rather than monetary policy in, in addressing financial stability issues. It's not-you know, the, the monetary policy we know strengthens economic activity and job creation through fairly well-understood channels. And a strong economy is actually a great supporter of financial stability. That will mean strong, you know, well-capitalized institutions, and, and households will be-will be working. And, and so we know that. We don't actually understand the tradeoff between-the sense of it is, would you-if you raise interest rates and thereby tighten financial conditions and reduce economic activity now in order to address asset bubbles and things like that, what-will that even help? Will it-will it actually cause more damage, or will it help? So I think that's unresolved. And I, I think it's, it's something we, we look at as not, not theoretically ruled out but not something we, we-we've ever done and not something we would plan to do. We would rely on macroprudential and other tools to deal with financial stability issues. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Yes. Thank you very much. I wanted to ask you, if there is a near-term rise in inflation related to the recovery, how will you determine whether or not it's something that's temporary or more enduring? And how much inflation is the Fed willing to tolerate before it acts to restrain price pressures? CHAIR POWELL. So, on inflation, a couple of things-there are a couple of things that are worth mentioning. One is just that we know that we measure inflation on a trailing 12-month basis. And as we-as we lap the very low inflation readings of March and April of last year, we'll see measured 12-month inflation move up a few tenths. This is just-they're called base effects, and, and that's a-that's a transient thing that we think will pass. There's also the possibility-indeed, it's in some forecasts-that as the economy fully reopens, there'll be a burst of spending, and-because people will be enthusiastic that the pandemic is over, potentially, and that that could also create some upward pressure on inflation. Now, again, we would see that as something likely to be transient and not to be very large. In both cases, we don't see those as either lasting or particularly large. So the way we would react is, we're going to be patient. Expect us to wait and see and not react if we see small and what we would review-we would view as very likely to be transient effects on inflation. I think if you-you know, it helps to look back at, at the inflation dynamics that the United States has had now for some decades and notice that there has been, you know, significant disinflationary pressure for some time, for a couple of decades. Inflation has averaged less than 2 percent for a quarter of a century. And the inflation dynamics, with the flat Phillips curve and low persistence of inflation, is very much intact. Those things, they change over time. We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don't change rapidly. So we think it's very unlikely that anything we see now would result in, you know, troubling inflation. Of course, if we did get sustained inflation at a level that was uncomfortable, we have tools for that. It's far harder to deal with, with too low inflation. We know what to do with higher inflation, which is, you know, should the need arise, we, we would have those tools. And we don't expect to see that at all. In terms of how much, you know, what we've said is we'd like to see-because inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, we'd like to see it run moderately above 2 percent for some time. We have not adopted a formula. We're not going to adopt a formula. We're going to-we, we use policy rules and formulas in everything we do, consult them constantly, but we don't set policy by them. We don't do that. And so we're going to preserve an element of judgment. And, again, we'll seek inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. And we'll, we'll show what that means when we get inflation above 2 percent. The, the way to achieve credibility on that is to actually do it. And so that's what we're planning on doing. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I have a two-pronged question about vaccines. So you specifically mentioned progress in the rollout of vaccines, but there is still plenty that we don't know about supply over the coming weeks and months. So I'm curious how you and your colleagues are factoring in vaccine rollouts and funding for distribution in your forecasts and what that timeline looks like. And then, secondly, I'm wondering if you, yourself haven't-has been-have been vaccinated, along with other FOMC members. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, in terms of the rollout of the vaccines, we see what everyone else sees, right? We see that we're, we're vaccinating people and at a rate of about a million a day, apparently, and that it'll take quite a while to get-to get to the numbers that the experts say are required to get to herd immunity. And we think it's going to be a struggle. You'll notice that we, we said that the, the pandemic still, still provides considerable downside risks to the economy. And that's one of the reasons why, is that-is the slowness of the rollout. The other-another reason why is just the arrival of these new virus strains. We don't know how to-we don't know how to model that. You know, we can have a base case, but we realize no one knows how the-how this new vaccine will roll out, how successful it will be, how high we'll be able to drive vaccination, and those sorts of things. So we have a base case, and we-but we always-we always look at, at the range of possibilities. In this case, we particularly look at the downside risks. You know, that's really what we do is, we, we set policies so that we're, we're, you know, we're going to remain accommodative until we actually see improvement in the economy and not just in the outlook, in the data. So that's, that's how we think about, about that. And I would-I would also add, there's nothing more important to the economy now than, than people getting vaccinated. You know, if you-if you, you think about the places where the economy is weak-I mentioned bars and restaurants. That's 400,000 jobs we lost last month, and that's all because of the spread of the pandemic. Many other areas of the economy-actually, there was actually job creation in-you know, in goods production and in some service parts-industries as well. But we're just not going to be able to get that last group of people back to work-and it's a big group of people-until we get the pandemic behind us. We, we have not won this yet. We haven't succeeded in doing this yet, and we need to stay focused on it as a country and, and get there. And, you know, we clearly can, but we're going to have to stay focused. And that includes-you know, that includes us at the Fed, monetary policy. I, I have been vaccinated once, and I expect to get my second vaccine sometime soon. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. A question-I have a question that I was going to ask, but I need to follow up for a second on the questions about the markets and macroprudential, and that is, you have one tool you can use. Would you be discussing-have you discussed raising margin requirements under Regulation T? And, if not, why not? CHAIR POWELL. No, we haven't-we haven't done that. I mean, remember, we're, we're focused on maximum employment, price stability, financial stability as I defined it-the broad financial sector. And, and that-that's not, you know-over the years, we, we consult the fact that we have that authority. But, no, it's not something we're looking at right now at all. MICHAEL MCKEE. All right. My follow-up question is, a lot of people in the markets think that you're basically stuck right now, because you can't really go lower with the zero bound, rejecting negative interest rates, and you can't really go higher because of the threat of a taper tantrum. Is the Fed locked into a very narrow corridor now? And, if not, you did say you would signal any change in interest rates a long time ahead. But [former] New York Fed President Bill Dudley says there's no way you can avoid a taper tantrum. So how do you do that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, first, I-we, we think our policy stance is, is just right. We think it's providing significant support for economic activity and hiring. We, you know, we, we adopted a new monetary policy framework of flexible average inflation targeting in August. In September, we, we implemented rate guidance that, that was consistent with and based on that new framework. In December, we did the same for asset purchases. So we now have, you know, strong guidance on, on rates and on asset purchases that's providing very strong support for economic activity. If you look at the sectors of the economy that are interest sensitive, you will see very strong activity: housing, durable goods, automobile sales. So, you know, our, our policies are working. And we think that, that they are-we think our policy stance is, is right. That said, there's clearly more that we can do. With asset purchases, for example, we can, you know-that's, that's a tool we can do more-we can strengthen our guidance, too, if we were to think that that were appropriate. What you see is an economy where what's holding it back is not the lack of, of policy support from the Fed. It's the pandemic. It's, it's the spread of the disease and people's reluctance or, or inability to partake in certain kinds of economic activities, which amount to a, a meaningful part of the economy. So that's, that's what I would say. We certainly have things that we can do, but we think we're-we think we're in the right place. You know, in terms of-in terms of tapering, it's just premature. We just created the, the guidance. We said we'd want to see substantial further progress toward our goals before we modify our, our asset purchase guidance. It's just too early to be talking about dates, which we should be focused on, on progress. We'll need to see actual progress. And when, when we see ourselves getting to that point, we'll communicate clearly about it to, to the public so nobody will be surprised when the time comes. And we'll do that well in advance of actually considering what will be a pretty gradual taper. MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I might, you-your policies are working, and you can maybe do more. But the question is, can you stop doing it when it's time? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, you know, I, I was here-we had all the same questions back in-after the Global Financial Crisis. We raised interest rates. We froze the balance sheet size, and then we shrank the balance sheet size. So there's no reason why we, we won't be able to do that again. In fact, we learned a lot from that experience. And, you know, we, we understand-as we understood then, but even more so-we understand that the-that the way to do it is to communicate well in advance, to, to do predictable things, and to move gradually. And that's, that's what we're going to do. We're going to be very transparent. But, honestly, no-you know, the whole focus on exit is premature, if I may say. We're focused on finishing the job we're doing, which is to support the economy, to give the economy the support it needs. There are people out there who've lost their jobs. It's essential that we get them back to work as quickly as possible, and we want to do everything we can to do that. And that is our primary focus right now. It's, it's, it's too soon to be-to be worried about that. You know, when we come to exit, we have a-we have an understanding of how to do that, and we'll do it very carefully. But in the meantime, our focus is on giving the economy the support it needs. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I just wanted to go back to fiscal stimulus for a second. You know, we just had a $900 billion package, and now Congress is talking about doing more. Do you expect more aid directly to consumers to be inflationary? And, specifically, how worried should lawmakers be about, you know, causing concerning levels of inflation? CHAIR POWELL. I, I would say that, again, we have been struggling with disinflationary forces for some time. If you look around the world-look in Western Europe, look at Japan-around the world, large economies have, have felt much more downward pressure on inflation, have fallen short of their inflation goals, for some time now. That is the broad global macroeconomic context that we all live in. And we believe that those global forces-which are, you know, aging demographics, advancing technology, and globalization-those, those forces are still in effect. Now, they may slow down, and, and it's, it's an interesting question, the extent to which, for example, globalization may slow down or even reverse. Notwithstanding that, inflation dynamics in the United States have, have consisted of a flat Phillips curve and low persistence for, for a long time. We do not expect in the near term that that will change significantly. It may evolve over time, but significant time. You know, these things are-these things are, are changing, but they don't change at a rapid rate. And there's-I, I don't believe that, that they will. So I wouldn't-I'm, I'm not-I'm much more worried about falling short of a complete recovery and losing people's careers and lives that they-that they built because they don't get to work-back to work in time and things like that. I'm more concerned about that and the damage that will do not just to their lives, but to the United States economy, to the productive capacity of the economy. I'm more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation. Frankly, we welcome slightly higher inflation, somewhat higher inflation. The kind of troubling inflation that people like me grew up with seems, seems far away and unlikely in, in the both domestic and global context that we've been in for some time. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Matthews, Bloomberg. STEVE MATTHEWS. Chair Powell, Treasury Secretary Yellen, in a memo to her employees yesterday, spoke of the close working relationship with the Federal Reserve. And I'm wondering how you would describe the relationship with, with Treasury under Chair Yellen, if you've met with, with, with Treasury Secretary Yellen and, and/or President Biden since he has taken office. And, you know, secondly, about that, as you know, in the last four years, there was constant criticism from the-of the Fed from the President and from other officials of the Administration. Do you have any kind of assurance or expectation that this will now be more of a hands-off attitude, in terms of commenting on monetary policy from the Administration? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So I have the highest respect and admiration for Secretary Yellen. And I'm, I'm sure that we're going to have a, a good working relationship together. Absolutely sure. We'll also have a good institutional relationship between the Fed and the Treasury. And I expect that that'll be very good and, and very productive. It'll be collaborative. We'll work together. Now, the way that works is, is that, you know, we know-the agencies know each other well, and this is true of finance ministries and central banks around the world. We know to stay in our lanes. We know we have different authorities. We know that we work together on some things to-you know, for the benefit of the public. And I'm, I'm absolutely sure that we're going to do that. I, you know, haven't-I haven't spoken to, to Secretary Yellen-I'm going to be calling her ""Chair Yellen"" most of the time, so you just have to be patient with me-Secretary Yellen. I haven't spoken to her since I congratulated her on being nominated. I do expect very soon to begin our regular calls or-and, and ultimately meetings, which have gone on, really, for, you know, 70 years. The Treasury Secretary and the, and the Fed Chair have had weekly or so meetings, lunches, breakfast, calls, depending on the situation. So I expect that will-that will happen soon. I've-I have not met the, the President, President Biden. And just, you know, I, I, I don't-I don't have any comment on your-on your last question. I wouldn't want to comment one way or the other. STEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up briefly, you have some 13(3) emergency programs that will expire March 31 that the Fed and the Treasury have worked on together. Do you have an expectation of whether those will be left, left to expire then or whether they will be extended? CHAIR POWELL. So I-I'll just say that I think our facilities were very successful in supporting the economy during its darkest moments and I believe saved-protected the loss of millions of jobs. We're going to continue to monitor financial and credit conditions throughout the economy. And, and if the kind of emergency conditions arise that are required under that law, then our emergency lending tools will remain available. Now, I've had no discussions with anybody at Treasury on that, because I haven't had any discussions with anybody at Treasury other than meet-you know, high-level meetings with the-with the transition team a month or so ago. And once we start having those, those meetings, of course, I'll observe, you know, the long-standing practice of not talking about confidential discussions. But as of now, there haven't been any discussions at all. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Howard Schneider, Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell, for doing this. So a couple questions on timing. In the statement, you removed-regarding the coronavirus-you removed the time reference ""short and medium term"" when it comes to the risks to the economic outlook, and it simply now says ""considerable risks to the economic outlook."" Should we read that as a sort of a positive change that you, you now see an end-sort of the endgame of this down the road? Or is it more that you're, you're worried it could last longer than you expect? And a related issue, have you given any guidance yet to the Fed staff or System on when the Fed itself might resume in-person events? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So in the statement, on the language, we dropped ""in the medium term,"" because, really, the risks are, are in the near term, frankly. You know, as I mentioned, it's the rollout of the vaccine. It's the arrival of new strains that, that are more contagious and perhaps more virulent. And those are the-those are the-and also just the ongoing-third thing, of course, is the ongoing spread of the virus. It's, it's in the near term. It's not in the medium term. We were thinking-when we were thinking ""medium term,"" we were thinking of longer-term scarring and things like that. Nonetheless, I mean, I think what-to go to your, your second question, and as I mentioned in my, in my opening remarks-there is good evidence to, to support a stronger economy in the second half of this year. In fact, if you look at, at-as we do-look at a range of private forecasters, what was their forecast in, in December, and what's their forecast now? Right across the board: much higher forecasts for 2021 growth. And that's because of the ongoing rollout of the vaccines and also because of fiscal policy, expectations, and the reality of, of the CRRA Act [Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021] getting done. So there is-there is a positive case there. But that-think of that as-the sort of base case is, is a strong economy in the second half of the year. The language says that there's still-I forget the exact language-downside risks. We used an adjective. It was ""considerable""-""considerable risks to the economic outlook."" So there are considerable risks, risks to the economic outlook. Nonetheless, that is-that is a more positive outlook. And that's really how, how I would-I would parse that for you. I don't know when we're going to come back to work, and I'm, I'm actually in the Eccles Building here today. And I don't know when that'll be. I mean, we-I can't wait to be working in person again. But, you know, we-we've been able to work successfully remotely. We really have. And, you know, we're not going to push people when they're uncomfortable. We're going to wait till people are comfortable and wait till it's well and truly time to get back together in person. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang. HANNAH LANG. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. The Fed in December eased its restrictions on bank dividend payments and share repurchases. And so I wanted to ask what factors the Fed will be looking at to determine what level banks can pay out in the second quarter and when we can expect such a decision. CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So we're, we're monitoring that on an ongoing basis, continue to-continuing to evaluate our, our restrictions. And we haven't made a decision about whether to continue them in the second quarter or not. We're just going to look at bank-we're going to look at the whole range of, of information, including economic activity, banking activity, the, the success in vaccination. All of those things will go into our assessment of what the right answer is to that question. I think we've been careful about, about rolling back those restrictions. And, and I'm pleased with where we are. Let's remember that the banks-that the banks that are subject to the stress tests have taken very, very large reserves-very large loss reserves, and also increased their capital. They've actually had-they have higher capital ratios now than they had at the beginning of the pandemic. So the banking system has held up well here. And, and-but, you know, we're going to be careful about this and, you know, move based on data, and all of the data, when we make that decision. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, thank you for taking the question. So I'm interested in the housing sector. Home prices are rising, 9 percent in some areas, because of low interest rates. Are you concerned about a bubble forming there yet? And is there a price increase, you know, that you're looking at where it might change the level of mortgage-backed securities the Fed is buying? And, as a continuation of that, is the bubble in the corporate debt cycle more concerning for you? CHAIR POWELL. So, on housing, you know, housing is now-the level of housing activity is at its highest level since before the Global Financial Crisis, in some measures. So we've had a very strong rebound in housing. Some of the, the tightness in housing markets, we think-which has led to the, the significant price increases this year-we think is, is a passing phenomenon. There was a lot of pent-up demand. There's a one-time thing happening with people who are spending all of their time in their house, and they're thinking either ""I need a bigger house"" or ""I need another house and a different house-or a second house,"" in some cases. So there's just-there's a-there's a one-time shift in demand that we think will get satisfied-also, that will call forth supply. And that will-that will, we think-we think that those price increases are unlikely to be sustained for, for all of those reasons. So you asked about corporate debt, I guess? EDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes. I'm just concerned if that's a bubble that you're watching. CHAIR POWELL. So we, we monitor pretty much all of the big financial markets pretty carefully. And, you know, what's happened in, in the corporate debt market, beginning with the announcement of our corporate credit facility, has been, you've seen lenders lending and borrowers borrowing. You've seen relatively significantly fewer defaults than we-than we expected. There were a lot of downgrades and some defaults at the beginning, and those have really slowed down. And, by the way, the same is true for bank loans. Banks are not experiencing the kinds of defaults that, that we all were concerned about in the early months of the pandemic. It's just not materializing. So they're having to reverse some of their loss reserves, actually. Debts-corporate debt spreads are, are tight. They've tightened. They were very broad-high-wide, of course, at the-during the acute phase of the pandemic, and they've-you know, they're now at the lower end of their typical range. And we do monitor that. You know, it's, it's not something we can control or operate on directly, but we do-we do watch those things. And, you know, in a sense, it's good that companies have been able to finance themselves during this period, because they-they've been able to stay in business. They've been able to keep their employees working. And, you know, that's a good thing. And that's, that's part of highly accommodative financial conditions. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Chris Rugaber. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thanks. Can you-since you suggested that the concern from the pandemic is perhaps a shorter-term concern and that's why you removed some of the language from the statement, can you talk about what kind of impact you're seeing so far? Do you feel that structural impacts have been-how would you characterize those? I know that's been a major concern-you've talked about at this press conference and others. Do we see longer-term damage to the job market? Have-or has there been some success in preventing that? And, compared to previous recessions, how would you characterize the damage to the job market here, in terms of things like, you know, permanent job loss, workers that need to shift industries, that kind of thing? CHAIR POWELL. You know, the, the, the big thing is that the jury's out. And this has been a concern since the very beginning, is the concern that people-if, if they become disconnected from the industry or the job where-that they used to work in, it, it can be years or never when they get back into the labor force, particularly for people who are well along in their careers-the same kind of scarring for small businesses, which don't have the kind of resources that you need to get through this. So we've, we've had a big concern about, about both of those. We haven't seen as much of it as we-as we feared. And that's a good thing. But as I said that, you know, the jury is out here-9 or 10 million people still out of work because of the pandemic. They're-a big chunk of them are people who worked in public-facing jobs in the service sector. And, you know, they've gotten a lot of support from fiscal policy and some from monetary policy. But the question is getting them back to work. And, you know, it's, it's harder if you're-it takes longer, empirically, to find that next job if you're looking at a brand-new industry. It's not easy to change careers completely midcareer. So that just, again, stresses the urgency that we feel and others feel at, at, you know, fully defeating the pandemic, finishing the job and getting back to a place where it's safe to have these-you know, to, to, to stay in hotels, to fly on airplanes, to go to sporting events and movie theaters, and all of those things. So those people are still at risk. And we're, we're very, very focused on that group of people with our policy and, and, and, you know, the way we look at the economy. So many people have had that bridge across the pandemic. You know, we talked about that at the beginning. For many people, it's clear that they've made it across, and their job is okay, and their house is okay. And, you know, it's been terribly inconvenient and painful, and schools are closed and things like that. But there, there's a bunch of people yet who haven't found that bridge yet. And we're, we're very focused on that. Of course, the other thing is, we're going to a different economy. And we're going to be learning more about that as we go. But, clearly, we're, we're learning that things can be done from remote locations. We're learning that technology can replace people even more than we thought. And some of that is happening. So I think as we, you know, as we get into this, you know, the phase after-even after the economy fully reopens, I think we're still going to need to keep people in mind whose lives have been disrupted, because they've lost that-the work that they did. And I think it would be wise as a country, for the longer-run productive capacity of the country, if we were to look out for those people and help them find their way back into the labor force even if it means continuing support for an additional period of time. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Great. If I could ask this quick follow-yesterday Susan Rice, domestic policy advisor at the White House, talked about a Citigroup study that said closing racial economic gaps could add up to $5 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next five years and 6 million new jobs. Do you agree that racial disparities are currently a drag on the economy? And, if so, what can the Fed do proactively to narrow those racial gaps in income and wealth, including potentially through regulatory policy? CHAIR POWELL. I strongly agree with that, as a matter of fact. I think if you look at either-look at employment gaps or unemployment gaps or wage gaps, wealth gaps, homeowning gaps, all of those persistent gaps that exist even controlling for many other factors, you will see that they're, they're persistent, they're-and they're very difficult to explain. And so it's-the reason we talk about inequality and, and racial inequality in particular, is that it goes to our job, which is to achieve maximum employment, which, which links up with, with-we want-we want the potential output of the United States to be as high as it can possibly be. We want-we want an economy where everybody can take part and everybody, everybody can put their labor in, and they can share in the prosperity of our great economy. That's what we want. And that's how the U.S. economy can be bigger, stronger, growing faster, is if we can achieve a more-a broader prosperity. So, now, in terms of our tools, you know, of course, that project that I just mentioned is one for the broader society, for the private sector, for fiscal policy, but we have a role to play. And, and that is, how we think about the labor market. Principally, when we say that the maximum employment is a, a broad and inclusive goal, what we're-what we're saying there is, we're not just going to look at the headline-and we never did, really, but-we're not going to just look at the headline numbers. We're going to look at different demographic groups, including women, minorities, and others. And we're not going to say that we've reached maximum employment, which is our statutory goal, until we've reached maximum employment. And you haven't if, if there's lots of pockets of, of people not participating in or not employed in the labor market. So those are the things that we can do. We also do a tremendous amount of research on these issues. You know, we do-we, we have such a focus on these issues now that we actually-we, we have a new, a webpage, relatively new, where you can access all of it. But it's a lot of activities in our Division of Consumer and Community Affairs. It's lots of research, and, and it's also, you know, our enforcement of the fair lending laws and things like that. So I think everybody's got a role to play here. It's a-it's a national goal and a national job, and we're just going to do our part of the job. And it's something we're strongly committed to. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we'll go to Scott Horsley at NPR. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. You said in your opening remarks that the, the economy in many ways had proven more resilient than, than people expected, and that that reflected the adaptability of both households and businesses. Are, are there adaptations that caught you by surprise, maybe related to remote work or new ways to do on-site work, in-person, face-to-face work that, that the economy's proven tougher than, than you expected at the outset of this pandemic? CHAIR POWELL. Well, yes. So I think, if you go back to the-to the beginning, there was a real concern. I mean, just, just take the financial markets, for example. Suddenly, all of those big buildings all over the, the-New York City and all around the world where people work in the financial markets with terminals and everything, everybody had to go home, and they had to take their terminals with them. And I think there was a real concern that there would be a tremendous loss of functionality just at the time when the financial markets were under historically difficult conditions. And yet, it worked out okay. So I think people-many people in the financial sector are still working with their terminals at home, including people on trading floors or on virtual trading floors. Now, some of that's reversing now. But we have definitely learned that we can do more work from home in many, many different lines of work. Of course, that's not possible if your job involves being at a place, doing personal services. For many people, it's not possible. And that's very much something that skews to higher-income, higher-educated people being able to work from home and others not so much. So I think we've learned that. The other thing, though, even conditional on that, when we saw the wave in the South and the West, the wave of cases this summer, I think, intuitively, having seen what happened in March and April, we expected there to be a significant hit to economic activity. And people kind of just got on with their lives and went and, and dealt with it. And, and it didn't actually-it had a much smaller effect on economic activity than we expected. Then comes the fall wave, which is just so much larger-a very, very large wave as, as was very much forecast. People going indoors, the cold weather, all of that. And even there, if you look at-I would say, look at the December jobs report. So, big job losses in, you know, in that part of the service sector. So I mentioned 400,000 jobs in bars and restaurants. There's another 100,000 in similar kinds of activities. But if you go-if you look elsewhere, it's not having an effect. You know, even purchasing manager index and sentiment indexes on, on areas of the economy that are not directly-really directly-exposed to the pandemic in their economic activity, they're doing okay. They are. Housing is a great example. You know, the way-the way-the way the housing industry worked, that when you buy a house, there was a lot of in-person contact. They managed to pretty much immediately go to a more virtual-you know, with all the technology. They were able to completely avoid that. And the housing market has been really strong, notwithstanding that it's, it's now quite virtual rather than in person. So there's been a lot of adapting, and-but you can't adapt, you know, hotels, sporting venues, movie theaters, restaurants, bars. You just-you know, those are just going to-and that's-again, that's millions and millions of people. And so you're just going to have to defeat the pandemic, which, as I mentioned, you know, we, we have a plan to do that, but we haven't done it yet. And we need to-we need to finish the job. And we-it's, it's within our power to do that as a country this year. And I would just urge that-and I know people are working hard on that. But that, that is really the main thing about the economy, is, is getting the pandemic under control, getting everyone vaccinated, getting people wearing masks, and all that. That's the single most important economic growth policy that we can have. Thank you."

"JOE PAVEL. Howard from Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Chair Powell, and, and thanks for that. So could you talk us through how the, the forecasts for 2021 map into the ""substantial further progress"" definition-you know, 2.4 percent inflation-I understand that's considered transitory. That still seems like some progress there, 4½ percent unemployment. Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet? CHAIR POWELL. [Laughter] Not yet. So, as you-as you pointed out, we've said that we would continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And that's actual progress, not forecast progress. So-and that's a difference from, from our past approach. So-and what we mean by that is, is pretty straightforward. It is, we want to see that, that the labor markets have moved-labor market conditions have moved-you know, have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, and inflation has made substantial progress toward the 2 percent goal. That's what we're going to want to see. Now, that obviously includes an element of judgment. And when we see-we'll be-we'll be carefully looking ahead. We, we also understand that we, we will want to provide as much advance notice of any potential taper as possible. So when we see that we're on track, when we see actual data coming in that suggests that we're on track to perhaps achieve substantial further progress, then we'll say so. And we'll say so well in advance of any decision to actually taper. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If, if I could follow up on that, this shift in the dots-why wouldn't that suggest a weakening of the commitment here? An awful lot of people shifted into 2022, it seems. CHAIR POWELL. I, I don't see that at all. You know, we, we have a, a range of perspectives on the Committee. I welcome that. And, you know, we, we have-we debate things, we discuss things, and we always come together around a-around a, a solution. But, you know, the, the strong bulk of the Committee is, is not showing a rate increase during this forecast period. And, you know, as, as data improve, as the outlook improves very significantly since the December meeting, you would expect forecasts to move up. It's probably not a surprise that some people would bring in their estimate of the appropriate time for liftoff. Nonetheless, you know, the bulk of the Committee-the, the largest part by far of the Committee is, is-doesn't show a rate increase during this period. And, again, part of that is wanting to see actual data rather than just a forecast at this point. We do expect that we'll begin to make faster progress on both spending-you know, labor markets and inflation as the year goes on because of the progress with the vaccines, because of the fiscal support that we're getting. We expect that to happen. But, you know, we'll have to see it first. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio. You know, there's been a lot of talk about what you all are going to do this month, which-I'm happy to hear an update if you have one. But just sort of more broadly, do you think, long term, that the leverage ratio poses problems for implementing monetary policy at a time when the reserve supply is going to remain large? And, if so, do you think the changes to the leverage ratio, including the SLR, are the way to deal with that problem? CHAIR POWELL. Victoria, we'll have something to announce on that in coming days. And I'm not going to expound upon your questions. Why don't you-why don't you ask another question if you'd like to? Because, because that one-I'm just going to say that we'll have something in coming days. VICTORIA GUIDA. Sure. Okay. Well, then I'll ask about unemployment. You know, there's-the unemployment rate is-you all have projections for the U-6 rate, but you've also been, you know, really emphasizing the fact that that's not the only thing that you all are looking at. You're also looking at labor force participation and things like that. So are you all looking at ways of maybe adding to how you're projecting the unemployment rate to the Summary of Economic Projections? CHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say, as we say in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we look to a range of indicators on the labor market. We never only looked at the unemployment rate, which is the only indicator of, of labor market outcomes that's in the SEP. We look at a very broad range. You hear us talk all the time about participation; about employment to population, which is the combination of the two; about different measures of, of unemployment. So it's wages, it's, it's the job flows, it's, you know, all of those things. They go into an assessment-disparities of various groups. All that goes into an assessment of maximum employment. The, the-trying to incorporate all of that into the Summary of Economic Projections would not be practical. You know, obviously, the thing that we do include is just the unemployment rate, and that's a very insufficient statistic. So-it, it doesn't include a lot of other things that we-that we do look at. And I, I wouldn't want to say that we're looking to include the other dozen things that we look at into the SEP. But at time-from time to time, we do look at, at adding different things. But I, I would just say the SEP is, it's a summary. It's one device. It's not going to include all of the things that we look at. I think you know the things that we look at-we, we talk about them all the time. So we're not actually looking actively at significantly broadening those indicators in the SEP right now. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. CHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the forecast overall. You're forecasting a very low unemployment rate next year and in 2023, you have inflation-or, the Fed overall is, in the SEP, forecasting inflation at or above 2 percent by 2023, yet no rate hike in any of this-in any of this forecast horizon. So is this telling us that we could see a higher inflation rate than was projected? Or do you not-as you've been talking about, is the unemployment rate insufficient? Or what is this telling us about the Fed's reaction function, that it seems you're meeting the Fed's dual mandate by 2023, yet, again, no rate hike expected? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess the first thing to say is that the, the SEP is not a Committee forecast. It's, it's not something we sit around and debate and discuss and approve, and say, ""This represents our, you know, our reaction function as a Committee."" It's a compilation of projections from different people. And I-since we don't debate it or discuss it, it would be hard for me to say why-exactly why each participant did what they were going to do. So all I would say about this is that we've-we laid out what I think is very clear guidance on liftoff. And it's really three things: labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of maximum employment-and, as I mentioned, we consider a wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions, not just the unemployment rate; inflation that has reached 2 percent, and not just on a transitory basis; and inflation that's on track to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. The first two of those three are very much data based; the third does have a little bit of a-of an element of expectations in it. So we are very much determined to implement this guidance in a robust way. It is the guidance that we chose carefully to implement our new framework. And to meet these standards, we'll need to see data, as I mentioned. So what does-what does this, this SEP really say? It says that we're committed to our framework and to the guidance we've provided to implement that framework. We will wait until the requirements set forth in that guidance are clearly met before considering a change in our policy rate. And the last thing I'll say is this: The state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain, and I wouldn't want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future. So that's how I would think about the, the SEP. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul Kiernan. PAUL KIERNAN. Thank you, Chairman Powell. My question is twofold. One, how high are you comfortable letting inflation rise? There, there is some ambiguity in, in your new target, as you mentioned, ""expectations driven."" And, and do you think that that ambiguity might cause markets to price in a lower tolerance for inflation than the Fed actually has, thereby causing financial conditions to tighten prematurely? Is that a concern? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So we've said we'd like to see inflation run moderately above 2 percent for some time. And we've resisted, basically, generally, the temptation to try to quantify that. Part of that just is, talking about inflation is one thing; actually having inflation run above 2 percent is the real thing. So I-you know, over the years we've, we've talked about 2 percent inflation as a goal, but we haven't achieved it. So I, I would say we'd like to, you know, perform. That's what we'd really like to do, is to get inflation moderately above 2 percent. I don't want to be too specific about what that means, because I think it's hard to do that. And we haven't done it yet. You know, when we're actually above 2 percent, we can do that. I-look, I, I would say this. The fundamental change in, in our framework is that we, we're not going to act preemptively based on forecasts for the most part. And we're going to wait to see actual data. And I think it will take people time to, to adjust to that-and to adjust to that new practice. And the only way we can really build the credibility of that is by doing it. So that's how I would think about that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Matthew Boesler. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. This is Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News. So there's a widespread presumption at this point that the U.S. will reach herd immunity sometime this year. And all along, you've said that the path of the economy is going to be determined by the course of the virus. I'm curious, based on the projections that you released today that show unemployment will still be above estimates of maximum employment through the end of next year and perhaps sometime into 2023, do you think policymakers need to be doing more here to sort of align the herd immunity and full employment timelines, if you will? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, on, on herd immunity, I, I'm really going to leave that question to the experts. We don't control that. We're not responsible for defining it. And we'll, we'll leave that whole discussion to the experts. I mean, we're-what we're focused on is, is the part that we control, which is the support that we provide to the economy. And there we've provided very clear guidance. And in the case of asset purchases, it's at their current level until we make substantial further progress. There is an element of judgment in that, and we'll, we'll-therefore, we'll supply clear communication well in advance of, of actually tapering, and we just went through, you know, the, the criteria for raising interest rates. They're very specific. And, you know, we're, we're very much committed to having them fulfilled robustly. I, I would agree with you that the, the path of the virus continues to be very important. We, we have these, you know, new strains with-which, which can be quite virulent. And we're not actually done yet. And I, I-we're clearly on a good path with, with cases coming down, as I mentioned, but we're not done. And I'd hate to see us take our eye off the ball before we actually finish the job. So that's how I would look at that. MATTHEW BOESLER. If I could just briefly follow up, how do you see sort of the disconnect in terms of an economy that is expected to be widely reopened this year but full employment taking longer to achieve? Is it, is it the case that factors related to the virus will still be with us over the coming years? Is that how to interpret the forecasts? CHAIR POWELL. I think there's some of that. Sure, there'll be some of that. There will still be some social distancing. People may be, for example, going into spaces that, that, you know, that involve close contact with others. Some people will do that right away. Others will hold back. And so I think there'll-there'll be some of that. In addition, though, remember, there are-there are 10 million people-in the range of 10 million people who need to get back to work. And it's going to take some time for that to happen. You know, it can-it can happen maybe, maybe more quickly than it has in the past, because it involves the reopening of a sector of the economy, as opposed to stimulating aggregate demand and waiting for that to produce job demand for workers. This could be a different sort of a process. And it could be quicker. We don't know that. But it's, it's just a lot of people who have-who need to get back to work. And it's not going to happen overnight. It would be-it's going to take some time. No matter how well the economy performs, unemployment will take quite a time to go-to go down, and so will participation. So that's all I can say. I think the faster the better; we'd love to see it come sooner rather than later. We'd welcome nothing more than that. But, realistically, given the numbers, it's going to take some time. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, thank you. I wonder if you could-kind of a three-parter here, but all related. Would you comment on the current level of the 10-year yield and some other long rates out there, whether or not you think they would have a negative effect on the economy? And, if not, is there a level that would give you concern? And, finally, the third part: Other central bankers have expressed concern about what's happened to yields in their countries and even some taken action, but not you. Could you give us your general idea or orientation towards the idea of, of coming into the market and affecting a particular tenor of the bond market? Do-do you like that idea? Do you not like it? Is it at the top of your toolbox, or is it something that you think is at the bottom of the toolbox? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we monitor a broad range of financial conditions, and we're always attentive to market developments, of course. We're still a long way from our goals, and it's important that financial conditions do remain accommodative to support the achievement of those goals. And if you look at various indexes of financial conditions, what you'll see is that they generally do show financial conditions overall to be highly accommodative. And that is appropriate. So that's, that's how we look at it. I would add, as I've said, I would be concerned by disorderly conditions in markets or by a persistent tightening of financial conditions that threaten the achievement of our goals. We think the stance of our-of monetary policy remains appropriate. Our guidance on the federal funds rate and on asset purchases is providing strong support for the economy. And we're committed to maintaining that patiently accommodative stance until the job is well and truly done. STEVE LIESMAN. Could, could you give us an idea of how you sort of feel about that tool, of being able to come into a particular part of the market and either operating-doing an Operation Twist or something like that? Is that something you feel to be the top of your toolbox or something that you don't really prefer? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we-the tools we have are the tools we have. What I'm telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate. We think that our asset purchases in their current form-which is to say, you know, across the curve, $80 billion in Treasuries, $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities on net-we think that that's, that's the right place for our asset purchases. Now, we can-we can change them, of course, in, in a number of different dimensions should we deem that that's appropriate. But, for now, we think that our policy stance on that is appropriate. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks very much for taking my question. You've spoken about the pandemic's disproportionate toll on Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and other groups in the labor market. And I'm curious if you can speak to specific indicators that the Fed will be using to measure job gains for groups that have persistently higher rates of unemployment compared to white Americans. And, relatedly, since you've described vaccines as key to the economic recovery, is the Fed concerned about lower vaccination rates in communities of color? And what barriers do you think exist there? Thanks very much. CHAIR POWELL. So, which measures. So we, we do monitor and communicate very regularly about different labor market-disparities in the labor market, let's say. So the African American unemployment rate is substantially elevated, and so is the Hispanic unemployment rate. So we look at those and we see those as, you know-it's, it's slack in the labor market. It's, it's sad to see, because those disparities had really come down to record lows since we started keeping the data that way. As recently as a year ago, February of last year, we had those, those disparities quite low. What happens in a downturn, though, is they move up at twice the speed of white unemployment. So we monitor those things. We-our tools, of course, affect unemployment generally, but we're going to look at those as, as a form of slack in the labor market and hope that, you know, that there's progress there. And, and this particular downturn, of course, was just a direct hit on, on a part of the economy that employs many minorities and lower-paid workers. The public-facing workers in the service industries in many cases don't have a lot of financial assets, they're not tremendously well paid, they might have other jobs, and things like that. So this was a direct hit on that part of the economy. And it's the slowest part of the economy to recover. So, you know, we'd like to see those people continue to get supported, you know, as we-as the broader economy recovers, which, which it's very much doing now. In terms of disparate levels of vaccination, that's-those are facts and unfortunate facts. They're really not something we, we have within our policy toolkit to address. But it is-it is true, though, that the data we have suggests that there are-there are significant disparities between different ethnic groups and-you know, but that's, that's not for us. That's for fiscal authorities and the government more generally to, to work on. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you see the fiscal policy support that has come down the line affecting the economy's potential in the longer term, just in the sense that you've talked a lot about the potential for labor market scarring and how that might weigh on our, sort of, future prospects. And I wonder whether you see that sort of working in reverse. You know, if we put people back into the labor market more quickly, does that improve our chances? CHAIR POWELL. So I do think that fiscal policy overall will have really helped us to avoid much of the scarring that we were very, very concerned about at the beginning. And I think that's just the size and the speed with which Congress has delivered-you know, with the CARES Act and since then, has-is going to wind up very much accelerating the return to full employment. It's going to make a huge difference in people's lives. And it has already. As I mentioned in my remarks-opening remarks, the recovery has been faster than we expected. Part of that just is, it's very hard to predict, given we've never seen an event like this. But part of it is just the strength of the fiscal response, which I think will, will look good over the years. Longer term, you know, to, to really-that's-the first part of it is about avoiding scarring, and I think we've not avoided all of the scarring, but we've probably avoided the worst cases there. And, and I hope we keep at it, and we will keep at it with our policies, of course, to do whatever we can to make sure that's-that continues. Longer term though, what it takes to drive productive capacity per capita or per hour worked, to raise living standards over time, is investment: investment in people's skills and aptitudes, investment in plant and equipment, investment in software. It takes a lot of investment to, to support a more productive economy and raise living standards. And that's-you know, that hasn't been the principal focus with these measures-our measures, certainly. And we don't have those tools. But what Congress has been doing has mainly been replacing lost income and beginning to, you know, support people as the economy returns to normal. But there should be a focus on-a longer-term focus, I think, would be healthy on, on the investment front. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi. JAMES POLITI. Thank you, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a question about the euro zone. While the outlook for the U.S. economy has much improved, progress in the euro zone has been far less encouraging. And it's showing signs of serious weakness due, due to the slower vaccination rollout and renewed lockdowns and restrictions. How worried are you about transatlantic economic divergence and the possibility that, that trouble in the euro zone and weakness in the euro zone could, could drag down the U.S. recovery as it did, in a way, in the aftermath of the financial crisis? CHAIR POWELL. You're right that the pace of the recovery is that we're having diverging recoveries here, as we did after the last crisis. And in this case, as well as the other one, the U.S.'s recovery is, is leading the global recovery. And, you know, we conduct policy, of course, here. Our, our focus is on-our, you know-our, our objectives are domestic ones. It's, it's maximum employment and price stability here in the United States. We monitor developments abroad, and we know-because they know we know that they can-those can affect our outcomes. So I think U.S. demand-very strong U.S. demand, if, if-as the economy improves is going to support global activity as well over time. That, that'll be through imports. And, you know, when the U.S. economy is strong, that strength tends to be-tends to support global, global activity as well. So that's one thing. I don't-I don't worry in the near term. I mean, I'd love to see Europe growing faster. I'd love to see the vaccine rollout going more smoothly. But I don't worry too much about us in the near term, because we're, we're on a very good track. Very strong fiscal support coming, now vaccination going quickly, and cases coming down. I think we're-I think we're in a good place. It's all ahead of us, but the data should, should get stronger fairly quickly here and remain strong for some time here. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang. HANNAH LANG. Hi, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to ask if the Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases-I'm sorry, share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter, and if you're considering at all the scenario analysis and midcycle stress tests that were in place last year, this year. And, kind of, what would make you consider doing something like that again? CHAIR POWELL. So we haven't made a decision on that. We're a couple weeks away from announcing that decision. I, I won't foreshadow it here today. I will say, we're going to continue our data-driven approach. You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends, so the firms are preserving capital. Through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital and their level of reserves. And the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well capitalized under our hypothetical recessions that we-that we used in December, which were quite stringent. We're right in the middle of our 2021 stress tests, and we'll release those results before the end of June. And that layers, you know, very significant additional stress on top of the stress the banks have already absorbed over the past year, with the unemployment rate going to 11 percent and stock prices falling more than 50 percent. So-but all of that, you know, the results of the stress tests and the decision on distributions-all of that is to come fairly soon, as I mentioned. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking these questions. You laid out the standards to lift off. And back in June of 2020, you said, you know, you're not even thinking about thinking about raising rates. But I see seven members seeing liftoff in 2023 and 4 next year. How, how much debate-and how can you characterize that conversation-has there been about moving off the lower bound earlier than signaled? CHAIR POWELL. Well, you know, it all depends. We've set out very clear criteria for liftoff, right, where we've said we want to see labor market conditions that are consistent with our estimates of, of maximum employment. And that doesn't just mean unemployment, it means a much broader set of criteria. We want inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transitory basis. And we want inflation on track to be moderately-to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. Those are the three conditions. Everybody on the Committee agrees to that, right? So it comes down to, what's your projection for the economy? If you want to-if you want to-you know, people will have a range of, of assessments for how good the economy is going to be. And, you know, we, we don't-I would say that we're in a relatively highly uncertain situation. If you look at the uncertainty, people, people on the Committee broadly say that uncertainty about the forecast is, is very high compared to the normal level. We haven't come out of a pandemic before. We haven't had this kind of fiscal support before, totaling it all up. So you're going to have different perspectives from Committee participants about how fast growth will be, how fast the labor market will heal, or how fast-sorry, inflation will move up. And those things are going to dictate where people write down an estimate of liftoff. Of course, this isn't a decision to lift off now. We'll make that decision then. But it's an estimate based on-based on assumptions about growth. And it's, it's meant to be a tool to generally show the public how, how our objective function works, how we think about the future. It isn't meant to actually pin down a time when we might or might not lift off. We-you know, we're not going to make that decision for some time. The chances are that the economy in that time and place will be very different from the one we think it'll be. So I-sometimes with the dots, I have to be sure to point out that they-they're not a Committee forecast. And you know this, but it's-they're not a Committee forecast. It's just compiling these projections, really, of individual people. We think it serves a useful purpose. It's not meant to, to actually be a promise or even a prediction of when the Committee will act. That will be very much dependent on economic outcomes, which are highly uncertain. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Brian Cheung. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hey there, Chairman Powell. I wanted to elaborate a little bit on your commentary about the fiscal stimulus. So it sounds like you, I guess, see the case for even maybe more investment, at least from Congress, to support the more productive economy, as you answered to Jeanna's question. So we just had $1.9 trillion dollars in spending. So where do you see the fiscal space right now? Do you still, I guess, maybe see the country in a place right now where it wouldn't be a concern if there were to be more spending at this time? CHAIR POWELL. So, Brian, it's not up to us to decide what, what Congress should spend money on or when. I was answering Jeanna's question, which really was, how do we assure lack of damage to-scarring, for example, or lack of damage to the productive capacity of the economy? And I think what's happened so far has done a pretty good job of that. But, really, I wanted to make the longer-run point that if-to work on the productivity-on productivity over longer periods, that is-that is-comes down to a number of things. But one of those things is investment: investment in people, in their skills, education, aptitude, all of those things. I'm not in any way suggesting that that's something Congress should work on right now. Or that, you know, that's just not my-that's not our job. I'm just saying, that, that is what fiscal policy can do that, really, monetary policy can't do-is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth. Those things are completely tools that Congress has. And, again, I wasn't making a comment at all on the current fiscal setting. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Next to Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to get your-an updated view on your sense of your view on financial stability risks and whether or not you see any pockets of excess out in financial markets that concern you, either, you know, specifically to that, that area of the market or as in terms of, like, the threat that it could pose to-propose to the overall economy. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, as you know, financial stability for us is, is a framework. It's not one thing. It's not a particular market or a particular asset or anything like that. It's a framework that we, we have. We report on it semiannually, the Board gets a report on it quarterly, and we monitor every day. And it has-it has four pillars, and those are four key vulnerabilities: asset valuations, debt owed by businesses and households, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions. Those four things. And I'll just quickly touch on them. So if you look at asset valuations, you can say that by some measures, some asset valuations are elevated compared to history. I think that's clear. In terms of households and businesses, households entered the, the crisis in very good shape by historical standards. Leverage in the household sector had been just kind of gradually moving down and down and down since the-since the financial crisis. Now, there was-there was some negative effects on that, people lost their jobs and that sort of thing, but they've also gotten a lot of support now. So the damage hasn't been as, as bad as we thought. Businesses, by the same token, had a high debt load coming in. And-but-and many saw their revenues decline. But there's-they've done so much financing, and there's a lot of cash on their balance sheet. So nothing in those two sectors really jumps out as really troubling. Short term-I mentioned funding risk as the-as the last one. So we saw, again, in this crisis, breakdowns in parts of the short-term funding markets-came under a tremendous amount of stress. And they've been quiet since the spring. And, you know, we shut down our facilities and all of that. But we, we don't-we don't feel like we can let the moment pass without just saying again that we-that those-some aspects of the short-term funding markets and, more broadly, nonbank financial intermediation didn't hold up so well under great stress-under tremendous stress. And we need to go back and look at that. So a very high priority for us as regulators and supervisors is going to be to go back-and this, this will involve all the other regulatory agencies; it does involve all of them as well-and see if we can strengthen those things. So that's, that's a-sort of a broader, detailed look. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, can you help me understand something about the, the SEP and your forecasts? The inflation that you're talking about for this year, you say, is ""transitory."" Then, by 2023, you're back down to 2.1 percent. There's no forecast for a rate increase for 2023. If you get to 3½ percent unemployment but inflation is only at 2 or 2.1 percent, are you willing to leave rates at zero going forward from there-or, roughly zero going forward from there? In other words, could we be in a Japan-like situation where rates just stay low because inflation does? CHAIR POWELL. Well, again, I wouldn't read too much into, into the, the March 2021 SEP dot plot. Remember what it is: It's a compilation of individual projections by individual members. They're all making different assessments. They, they have different forecasts, economic forecasts. Some have more optimistic ones, some less optimistic. And they're-also remember that the SEP doesn't actually include all the things that go into maximum employment. Right? It's, it's only-it only includes unemployment. So I, I would just say, we've set out clear guidance. The-the message from the SEP that I would like to leave with people is, we set out clear guidance. I mentioned what it was. It's inflation up to-no, sorry, it's, it's labor market conditions consistent with our estimates of maximum employment-and that's not just unemployment, it's all the other indicators, but, overall, totaling up to maximum employment; it's inflation at 2 percent, and not on a transient basis; and inflation on track to exceed 2 percent for-moderately for some time. Those are the criteria. We're committed to robustly implementing that guidance. And that's what this-that's what this says. That's really all it says. We're going to wait until those requirements are met. And, again, you know, the, the state of the economy in two or three years is highly uncertain. And I wouldn't want to focus too much on the exact timing of a potential rate increase that far into the future. MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up, I'm just wondering-before 2019, I would say you were focused on the problems with having interest rates too low. Now are you saying we're willing to live with it until we reach these goals even if you get-meet your goal on maximum employment? CHAIR POWELL. So what I would say is, we're committed to giving the economy the support that it needs to return as quickly as possible to a state of maximum employment and price stability. And, you know, to the extent having rates low and support for monetary policy broadly, to the extent that raises other questions, we think it's absolutely essential to maintain the strength and stability of the-of the broader financial system and to carefully monitor financial stability questions if that's what you're getting at. You know, we, we do that. We will-we monitor them very carefully. I, I would point out that, over the long expansion-the longest in U.S. history, 10 years and 8 months-rates were very low for-they were at zero for, you know, 7 years and then-and then never got above, you know, 2.4 percent, roughly. During that, we didn't see, actually, excess buildup of debt. We didn't see asset prices form into bubbles that would threaten the progress of the economy. We didn't see the things you-we didn't see a housing bubble. You know, the things that have tended to really hurt an economy and have in recent history hurt the U.S., we didn't see them build up despite very low rates. Part of that just is that you're in a low-rate environment, you're in a much lower rate environment, and the connection between low rates and the kind of financial instability issues is just not as tight as people think it is. That's not to say we ignore it. We don't ignore it. We, we watch it very carefully. And we don't think-we think there is a connection. We say there is, but it's not quite so clear. We actually monitor financial conditions very, very broadly and carefully. And we didn't do that before the Global Financial Crisis 12 years ago. Now we do. And we've also, you know, put a lot of time and effort into strengthening the large financial institutions that form the core of our financial system-are much stronger, much more resilient. That's true of the banks. I think it's true of the CCPs. We want it to be true of, of other nonbank financial intermediation, markets, and, and institutions. So I think that's, that's-you know, monetary policy should be, to me, for, for achieving our macroeconomic aims. Financial regulatory policy and supervision should be for strengthening the financial system so that it is strong and robust and can withstand the kinds of things that it couldn't, frankly-and we learned that in 2008, '09, '10. This time around, the regulated part of the financial system held up very well. We, we found some other areas that need strengthening, and that's what we're working on now. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Anneken, CNN. ANNEKEN TAPPE. Thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, could you talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in, in inflation? Does the former offset the latter to some degree? CHAIR POWELL. I'm sorry, could you repeat that? You broke up there for a second. ANNEKEN TAPPE. Oh, no, I was hoping that wouldn't happen. Can you hear me now? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, yes. ANNEKEN TAPPE. Okay, great. I was asking if you could talk to us a little bit about the relationship between the persistent pandemic unemployment and the expected increase in inflation. I'm wondering whether the former offsets the latter and to which degree you guys are monitoring this. CHAIR POWELL. You're asking about the relationship between unemployment and inflation? Is that-is that the question? ANNEKEN TAPPE. Yes, exactly. CHAIR POWELL. Okay. ANNEKEN TAPPE. If they offset each other-the persistent pandemic unemployment. CHAIR POWELL. Yes, I think I'm hearing you correctly. So I would say a couple things. There was a time when there was a tight connection between unemployment and inflation. That time is long gone. We had extremely low unemployment in, in-not extremely low. We had low unemployment in 2018 and '19 and the beginning of '20 without having troubling inflation at all. We were at 3.5 percent. We were bouncing around with unemployment 3.5 percent to 4 percent. And it wasn't just unemployment. Participation was high, wages were moving up. It was a very healthy thing. And we didn't see price inflation move up. There is a relationship between wage inflation and unemployment. But that has not-what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices. And that seems to be a feature of late-cycle behavior. So we're, we're not-when, when we-when we seek to achieve low unemployment, high levels of employment, which is our mandate, you know, we think we have the freedom to do that based on the data without worrying too much about inflation. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Going to Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up a little bit. I, I understand what you're saying about the dot plot and, and the message you're trying to send with the dot plot. But does the same apply for the taper tantrum? You've said that it's going to take ""some time"" to get some fundamental progress on your goals, but it seems like ""some time"" could now be any time. CHAIR POWELL. So we've said ""substantial further progress."" Now, if you go back, October, November-sorry, November, December, and January, progress in the labor market slowed very sharply. So you had an average of 29,000 jobs per month. If you go back and look at the, the level of job creation before that, it was very, very high-very high. So we weren't making any progress on the labor market from November through January. February, we saw a nice-a nice pickup, a good jobs report-379,465 private sector. So that's good. It can go so much higher, though. And, and, you know, it would be nice to see-to really make faster progress that's different from substantial progress, we'd like to see it be, be higher than that. And I think it will be. That's-the expectation is, you'll see now, I think, really strong job creation return-not as high as it was in the very early days of the recovery, the reopening of the economy, but, nonetheless, very strong. Okay. So what, what I'm saying is, to achieve substantial progress from where we are, having had three months of, of very little progress, is going to take some time. And it's-we don't want to get into-I don't want to get into trying to put a pin on the calendar someplace, because it's going to be data dependent. When we see-when we see ourselves on track to make substantial further progress, we're going to-we're going to say so. We understand fully that that test is one that involves judgment. If you remember, during the Global Financial Crisis recovery, we said quantitative easing, number three, was-the test was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. Well, what does that mean? Well, it means a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market. It meant we would communicate when we thought we had that. This is just like that, in a way. What we're saying is, substantial further progress toward our goals. We'll tell people when we think-until we-until we say-until we give a signal, you can assume we're not there yet. And as we approach it, well in advance-well in advance-we will give a signal that, yes, we're on a path to, to possibly achieve that, to consider tapering. So that's, that's how we're planning to handle it. It's not different, really, from, from QE3. And I think we've learned-what we've learned from the experience of these last dozen years is to communicate very carefully, very clearly, well in advance, and then follow through with, with your communications. In this case, it's, it's an outcome-based set of guidance, as our rate guidance is, and it's going to depend on the progress of the economy. That's why it's not appropriate to start pointing at dates yet. GREG ROBB. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Don Lee, L.A. Times. DON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. As you know, households, households are sitting on a lot of excess savings. And I wonder if, combined with that, you have an unleashing of, you know, pent-up demand. How much do you think that would affect-that would affect inflation? And would you expect that to be transitory? CHAIR POWELL. We, you know, we and everyone who's forecasting these-what, what we're all doing is, we are looking at the-at the amount of savings. We're looking at-you know, we have reasonably good data on that. And we're looking at the government transfers that'll be made as part of the various laws. And we're trying to make an assessment on what will be the tendency of people to spend that money, the marginal propensity to consume. And from that, you can develop an estimate of the impact on spending, on growth, on hiring, and, ultimately, on inflation. So that's, that's what we're all doing. And we have, you know, we have-we can look at history, and we can make estimates, and those are all very transparent and public. And you can compare one to the other. And, of course, we've all-we've all done that. And I think we've made very conservative assumptions and sensible mainstream assumptions at each step of that process. And what, what it comes down to is what I said before, which is, there very likely will be a step-up in inflation as March and April of last year drop out of the 12-month window, because they were very low inflation numbers. That's a-that'll be a fairly significant pop in inflation. It'll wear off quickly, though, because it-just the way the numbers are calculated. Past that, as the economy reopens, people will start spending more, and then, you know, you can only go out to dinner once per night, but a lot of people can go out to dinner. And so-and they're not doing that now. They're not going to restaurants, not going to theaters. That part of the economy-and travel and hotels-that part of the economy is, is really not functioning at, at full capacity, right? But as that happens, people can start to spend. It's also-wouldn't be surprising if-and you're seeing this now, particularly in the goods economy-there'll be bottlenecks. They won't be-they won't be able to service all of the demand maybe, maybe for a period. So those things could lead to-and we've, we've modeled that. Other people have too. We've-and what we see is relatively modest increases in inflation. So-but those are not permanent things. You know, what'll, what'll happen is-the supply side-the supply side in the United States is very dynamic. People start businesses, they, they reopen restaurants, you know, the airlines are, will be flying again, all of those things will happen. And so it'll turn out to be a one-a one-time sort of bulge in, in prices, but it won't change inflation going forward, because inflation expectations are strongly anchored around 2 percent. We know that inflation dynamics do evolve over time. And there was a time when, when inflation went up, it would stay up. And, and that time is not now. That hasn't been the case for some decades. And we think it won't-it won't-we won't suddenly change to another regime. These things tend to change over time. And they tend to-tend to change when the central bank doesn't understand that having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent is the key to it all. The, the-having them anchored at 2 percent is what gives us the ability to push hard when the economy's really weak. If we saw inflation expectations moving materially above 2 percent, of course, we would conduct policy in a way that would, would make sure that that didn't happen. We're committed to having inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, not materially above or below 2 percent. So that's-I think if you-if you look at the savings, look at all of that, model it, that's, that's kind of what comes out of our assessment. There are different possibilities. I think it's, it's a relatively unusual-very unusual situation to have all these savings and this, this amount of fiscal support and monetary policy support. Nonetheless, that, that is our most likely case. And you know, as the-as the data come in and the economy performs, we'll of course adjust. Our outcome-based guidance will immediately adapt, we think, to meet whatever the actual path of the economy is. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Scott Horsley for the last question. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Chairman Powell. My question is about those supply chain bottlenecks, especially on the goods side. Are they getting better, or are they getting worse? We saw they were sort of a drag on the industrial production numbers we-that came out yesterday. And what do you expect them to do to prices in, in-just in the short run? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I have to say, I think it's impossible to say, frankly, with any confidence, but I, I would expect it's very possible-let's put it that way-that you will see bottlenecks emerge and then clear over time. And you'll probably see that over a period of time, because, you know, really, the, the strong data are ahead of us. You know, you're, you're-right now the, the checks are going out just, just now. And that'll, that'll add to spending. COVID cases are coming down. Vaccination is moving, now, quickly. You know, the, the really strong economic data is coming. It should be coming, assuming we stay on this track. And that's when you'll really know where, where the bottlenecks are. But you can see, though, that they're not-these are not permanent. It's not like the supply side will be unable to adapt to these things. It will-the market will clear. It just may take some time. And, and some of the answer to that may be price. In many cases, it won't be price. You'll see that people are reluctant to raise prices. You know, it's a little bit the story about, you know, the wage-the wage Phillips curve does show that as unemployment goes down, wages move up. But companies choose not to try to, to pass that, that price increase along to their customers. So you'll see a lot of that here too, I think. Anyway, we'll, we'll see. But that's, that's my basic, basic sense. Thank you very much. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. First we'll go Paul Kiernan. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for doing this. I guess, since I'm first, I'll go ahead and re-up Howard's question from the last press conference: Is it time to start talking about talking about tapering yet? Have you and your colleagues had any conversations to this effect? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So, no, it is not time yet. We've said that we would let the public know when it is time to have that conversation, and we said we'd do that well in advance of any actual decision to taper our asset purchases, and we will do so. In the meantime, we'll be monitoring progress toward our goals. We first articulated this ""substantial further progress"" test at our December meeting. Economic activity and hiring have just recently picked up after slowing over the winter. And it will take some time before we see substantial further progress. PAUL KIERNAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jonnelle at Reuters. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 5 of 29 JONNELLE MARTE. Okay. Hi. Thank you so much. My question is about what's going on with the virus, and what if we don't reach a level of herd immunity, per se. So, in your scenario, thinking about the outlook and the economy, do you have some model where you might start to still normalize policy even if there's like a baseline of infection still going on? Or how can you, you know, talk about how you're weighing those things? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, so we have to leave questions about herd immunity and what that looks like to the health experts, but, but I would certainly say that what matters the most to the economic recovery continues to be controlling the virus. The economy can't fully recover until people are confident that it's safe to resume activities involving crowds of people. There may be people who are around the edges of the labor force who won't come back in unless they feel really comfortable going back to their old jobs, for example, and there, there may be parts of the economy that will-that just won't be able to, to really fully reengage until the pandemic is decisively behind us. But, you know, we've articulated particular guidance for tapering our asset purchases and for lifting off and raising interest rates. So for, for asset purchases, we've said that we would continue at the current pace of asset purchases until we see substantial further progress toward our goals. So-and that is, that is what it is, substantial further progress. For interest rates, as I-as I said a moment ago, we want to see labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, we want to see inflation at 2 percent, and we want to see it on track to exceed 2 percent. So those are our tests. We don't have an independent test to do with the virus. I will say, though, as I-as I started with, you know, the, the path of the virus is going to have an effect on our ability to achieve both of those tests. MICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. Jeanna. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 6 of 29 JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that test for raising interest rates that you just elaborated. You've obviously made it very clear that you want to see improvements in the real economy and the real data and not in just sort of expectations data before making that move. But I guess I wonder what happens if inflation expectations were to move up before you see some sort of return to full employment. You know, it seems like a lot of sort of the stability in inflation has been tied to the fact that those have been so low and stable, and I guess I wonder how, how your reaction would be-sort of how your reaction to that is, is-how you're thinking about that. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So it seems unlikely, frankly, that we would see inflation moving up in a persistent way that would actually move inflation expectations up while there was still significant slack in the labor market. I won't say that it's impossible, but it, it seems-it seems unlikely. It's much more likely that we would-having achieved maximum-employment conditions-we'd also be seeing 2 percent inflation and be on track to see inflation moving above 2 percent. They tend to move together. So that's not to say inflation won't-might not move up, but for inflation to move up in a persistent way that, that really starts to move inflation expectations up, that would have to-that would take some time. And you would think that, that it would be quite likely that, that we'd be in very strong labor markets for that to be happening. If it-if that actually were to happen, though, there is a-there's a paragraph in the-in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy which says that when the two goals are somewhat in conflict, we weigh various factors, including the, the time it would take to get back and [so] forth. So we do-it doesn't really tell you what to do, but it tells you that we will weigh those two factors and how far we are away from them and how long it would take to reach them were we to reach that sort of pretty unlikely state. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 7 of 29 MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I want to follow up on Jonnelle's question, and I wonder if you can help us understand better your thinking about how COVID infection rates and the virus calibrate with monetary policy. As you recall, we had a major resurgence in the virus last fall. And I'm wondering, would you need to be assured that there wasn't such a resurgence coming before you began-I mean, for lack of a better term-thinking about thinking about tapering? And what kind of comfort level would you need? Would it be something that would be declared from the CDC or the, or the World Health Organization-for example, downgrading the virus from a pandemic-before you have the comfort level to reverse course on policy? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. We, we really have-just articulated the goals that I've-that I've just mentioned a couple of times, which is substantial further progress toward our goals before we taper. Now, that's very likely-for us to achieve that, it's very likely going to be the case that we've also made really significant progress on controlling the virus through vaccination and, and other-it, it-you know, those two things should more or less coexist. We haven't articulated a separate test for a state of the virus that we'd like to achieve because we're not-you know, we're not experts in that area. We're, we're really focused on the economic outcomes, and, again, my, my guess is that we-it's very likely, it seems to me, that for us to achieve the economic outcomes, we would need to taper or to raise interest rates. We would also have to have made very substantial progress in getting the virus under control-not, not necessarily fully under control. There is a, a possibility, of course, that we will, will have ongoing outbreaks over the summer and various regional outbreaks and potentially next winter April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 8 of 29 as well. But we'll be looking for substantial progress toward our goal-substantial further progress toward our goals as we think about tapering asset purchases. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask, you've talked a lot during this crisis about the need to have a lot of help from fiscal policy and monetary policy to make sure that there's not long-term scarring in the economy. And I was just wondering, you know, given all of the policies that have been put in place, do you expect there to still be some long-term scarring? And, if so, you know, what are you most worried about? Where are you most worried about that showing up? CHAIR POWELL. So I would say that we were very worried about scarring, both in the labor market from people being out of-out of the labor market for an extended period of time. The evidence is clear that it becomes much more difficult if you're out for a long time to get back in and get back to the life that you had. Same thing with these small businesses, many of which are the work of generations. Were we going to wipe out many of those unnecessarily? That was a big concern. I would say that, so far, you know, here we are in late April of 2021. We haven't experienced that level of scarring either in the labor market or among smaller businesses. So we're not living that, that downside case that we were very concerned about a year ago. Notwithstanding that, we're a long way from full employment. We're-you know, payroll jobs are 8.4 million below where they were in February of 2020. We've got a long ways to go. And also, it's going to be a different economy. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 9 of 29 So we've been hearing a lot from companies that they are-they've been looking at deploying better technology and perhaps fewer people, including in some of the service industries that have been employing a lot of people. You know, it, it may well be-it seems quite likely that a number of the people who, who had those service-sector jobs will struggle to find the same job and may need time to find work and get back to the working life they had. These were people who were working in February of 2020. They clearly want to work. So those people are going to need-they're going to need help. And so, while I would say we haven't seen really highly elevated levels of unemployment for-you know, up in the teens that we thought we might have for an extended period of time, we've still got a lot of people who are out to-out of work. We want to get them back to work as quickly as possible, and that's really one of the things we're trying to achieve with our policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. The housing market in many American cities is seeing booming prices, bidding wars, and all-cash offers well above asking price. And this is happening at the same time that housing is becoming much more expensive for lower-income Americans and people who are still struggling from the pandemic. Do you have concerns that there are localized housing bubbles or that there's the potential for that, and what is the Fed doing to monitor or address this? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we do monitor the housing market very carefully, of course. And I would say that, before the pandemic, it's a very different housing market than it was before the Global Financial Crisis. And one of the main differences was that households were in very good April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 10 of 29 shape financially compared to where they were. In addition, most people who got mortgages were people with pretty high credit scores. There wasn't the subprime-you know, low-doc, no-doc lending practices were not there. So we don't have that kind of thing where we have a housing bubble where people are overlevered and owning a lot of houses. There's no question, though, that housing prices are going up, and so we're watching that carefully. It's, it's partly because there's, there's clearly strong demand, and there's just not a lot of supply right now. So builders are, you know, struggling to keep up with the demand, clearly. Inventories are tremendously low. We're, we're all hearing those stories. And if you're-if you're an entry level housing buyer, this is-this is a problem, because it just is going to be that much harder for people to get that first house, and that's a problem. I mean, we-it's part of a strong economy, with people having money to spend and wanting to invest in housing. So, in that sense, it's good. It's clearly the strongest housing market that we've seen since the Global Financial Crisis. And, you know, my hope would be that, over time, housing builders can react to this demand and, and come up with more supply and workers will come back to work in that industry. So, you know, it is-it's not an unalloyed good to have prices going up this much, and we're watching it very carefully. I don't see the kind of financial stability current concerns, though, that really do reside around the housing sector. So many of the financial crackups in all countries, all western countries, that have happened in the last 30 years have been around housing. We don't-we really don't see that here. We don't see bad loans and unsustainable prices and that kind of thing. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 11 of 29 CHRIS RUGABER. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the labor market. Do you-do you see things, such as in the Beige Book-you saw in the Beige Book anecdotes about businesses not able to find workers, [inaudible] back to the labor market for fear of getting sick, childcare concerns, and so forth. Do you see these as also just sort of temporary bottlenecks that won't have much effect on the long-term health of the labor market? Or how are you thinking about these kinds of issues? CHAIR POWELL. Chris, you were breaking up a little there, but I think I did get your question. So I think there are a number of-a number of things going on there: the tension between a high level of unemployment and yet many, many companies saying they can't find- an elevated number of companies saying that they can't find workers. So, what's really going on there? It, it should be a number of different things. There are workers who don't actually have the specific skills that the employers are looking for. There may be geographical differences. It, it may also be that, for example, there-one big factor would be, schools aren't open yet, so there are still people who are at home taking care of their children and would like to be back in the workforce but can't be yet. There are people afraid of-there are virus fears that are weighing on people, so some-some people don't want to go back to work. There are also a significant number of people who say they've retired-a large number of people that say that they're retired. Now, it's hard to say whether they will come back in as the labor market strengthens and as COVID, you know, becomes a-in the rearview mirror, in the history books, if you will. So-but clearly there's something going, going on out there, as, as many companies are reporting labor shortages. We don't see wages moving up yet, and presumably we would see April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 12 of 29 that in a real-you know, in a really tight labor market. And we may well start to see that. I do think-so what will happen-what we saw during the last expansion, and it may be a different expansion, we don't know, but, but what we saw was that labor supply generally showed up. In other words, if you were worried about there-about running out of workers, it seemed like we never did. You know, labor force participation held up. People came in the labor force. They stayed in the labor force longer than expected. So my guess would be that you will see people coming back into the labor force, and these jobs will be-the labor market will reach equilibrium. Maybe pay will go up. But I do think that-and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that's a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon. So my guess is, it will come back to this economy where we have, you know, equilibrium between labor supply and labor demand. It may take some months, though. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Heather Scott. CHRIS RUGABER. Could I do a quick follow-up? MICHELLE SMITH. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Go ahead, Chris. CHRIS RUGABER. Well [extended pause] MICHELLE SMITH. We, we lost you, Chris. Let's go on to Heather. HEATHER SCOTT. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask you, you know, you've been hearing, of course, these concerns raised by Larry Summers and others about inflation and the fact that they think the Fed might be-might let things get out of hand with the new policy stance. So my question is, can you tell us, what is different this time versus previous periods like in the '60s when inflation got out of control? Why are you confident with, April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 13 of 29 with the lags in monetary policy that the Fed can get ahead of inflation and, and make sure it doesn't go too far above the 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL. Thanks for your question. So I actually have a couple things I'd like to say about inflation, including addressing your question. So let me start with just saying that we're very strongly committed to achieving our objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Our, our price stability goal is 2 percent inflation over the longer run, and we believe that having inflation average 2 percent over time will help anchor long-term inflation expectations at 2 percent. With inflation having run persistently below 2 percent for some time, the Committee seeks inflation moderately above inflation for two times-above 2 percent for some time. So, with a, a little bit of context, we're, we're making our way through an unprecedented series of events, really, in which a synchronized global shutdown is now giving way to widespread reopening of economies in many places around the world. In the United States, fiscal and monetary policy continue to provide strong support: Vaccinations are now widespread, and the economy is beginning to move ahead with real momentum. During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I'll discuss why. But those pressures are likely to be temporary as they are associated with the reopening process. In an episode of one-time price increases as the economy reopens is not the same thing as, and is not likely to lead to, persistently higher year-over-year inflation into the future- inflation at levels that are not consistent with our goal of 2 percent inflation over time. Indeed, it is the Fed's job to make sure that that does not happen. If, if, contrary to expectations, inflation were to move persistently and materially above 2 percent in a manner that threatened to move longer-term inflation expectations materially above 2 percent, we would use our tools to bring April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 14 of 29 inflation and expectations down to mandate-consistent levels. And I would say, if I may, that is a principal difference from-we're all very familiar at the Fed with the history of the 1960s and '70s, of course. And we know that our job is to achieve 2 percent inflation over time. We're committed to that, and we will use our tools to do that. So that's a very different situation than you had back in the 1960s-or many, many differences, actually. So let me talk quickly about the two reasons-two, or you could say three, but really two main reasons why we think inflation will move up in the near term. The first is the base effects. Twelve-month measures of inflation are likely to move well above 2 percent over the next few months as the very low inflation readings recorded in March and April of last year drop out of the calculation. That process has already started to show up. You saw it in the March CPI reading, and you'll see it later this week in the PCE price data. These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May. So, significant increases, and they'll disappear over the following months. And they'll be transitory. They carry no implication for the rate of inflation in later periods. So that's base effects. The other big one I would talk about is bottlenecks. So this is what we're seeing in supply chains in various industries, and we're, we're in close touch with all of these industries. You know, the Fed has a network of contacts that is unequaled in businesses and in nonprofits for that matter, too. So what do we mean by a bottleneck? A bottleneck really is a temporary blockage or restriction in the supply chain for, for a particular good or goods, something that slows down the process of producing goods and delivering them to the market. We think of bottlenecks as things that, in their nature, will be resolved as workers and businesses adapt, and we think of them as not calling for a change in monetary policy since they're temporary and April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 15 of 29 expected to resolve themselves. We know that the base effects will disappear in a few months. It's much harder to predict with confidence the amount of time it will take to resolve the bottlenecks, or for that matter, the temporary effects that they will have on prices in the meantime. So, you know, I'll just sum up and say, we understand our job. We will do our job. And we are, we are focused-as you've seen, for many years, we've been focused on inflation deviating below 2 percent, and we used our tools aggressively to keep it back up at 2 percent. If, if we see inflation moving materially above 2 percent in a persistent way that risks inflation expectations drifting up, then we will use our tools to guide inflation and expectations back down to 2 percent. No one should doubt that we will do that. This is not what we expect. But no one should doubt that, in the event, we would be prepared to use our tools. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James Politi. JAMES POLITI. Chair Powell, you said a few weeks ago that it would-thank you, Chair Powell. You said a few weeks ago that it would take a string of months of job creation of about a million to achieve progress towards your goal. Can you define what your, what your definition of ""a string of months"" is more specifically? And, on inflation, the FOMC said the rise in inflation we're beginning to see largely reflects transitory factors, as you just described. But why use the word ""largely,"" and what are the factors driving higher prices that may not be transitory, based on the initial data that you're seeing? CHAIR POWELL. So, what is ""a string""? What do I mean by ""a string""? Well, I would say, what we have right now is one really good-I can tell you what it's not. It's not one really good employment reading, which is what we got in March. We got close to a million jobs in March and a very strong labor market reading. And I was just suggesting that we'd want to see April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 16 of 29 more like that. We're 8½ million jobs below where we were in February of 2020, and that doesn't account for growth in the labor force and growth in the economy, that trend we were on. So we have-we're a long way from our, our goals. And we don't have to get all the way to our goals to taper asset purchases, we just need to make substantial further progress. It's going to take some time. On, on ""largely,"" there are a bunch of factors. I was really thinking-we were thinking of the base effects and also the energy effects. I wasn't meaning to say there are some real effects. I mean, there are always-there are always relative prices going up and down within inflation. You know, there's a basket for CPI or PCE. There are, you know, many, many, many factors that go into it. Relative prices are always moving up and down. This, this-we think it's, it's very fair to say that the increases we see and, frankly, are about to see later this week are largely due to base effects. It would have been more contentious to say ""entirely due to base effects"" because there are some things that are always going up, and so we just said ""largely."" MICHELLE SMITH. [Inaudible] CATARINA SARAIVA. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Over the past decade, the Fed has invested significant resources in large-scale bank supervision-has completely overhauled that approach. And it's even created a special committee that looks horizontally across the largest banks to find common risks. Did the Fed not see that multiple banks had large exposures to Archegos? If not, why not? And then, what regulatory changes would you like to see implemented to change that going forward? CHAIR POWELL. We're, we, we supervise banks to make sure that they have riskmanagement systems in place so that they can spot these things. We don't manage their companies for them or, or try to manage individual risks. In the grand scheme of these large April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 17 of 29 institutions, the Archegos risks were not systemically important or were not of the size that they would have really created trouble for any of those institutions. What was troubling, though, was that this could happen in a business for a number of firms that is thought to be-to carry relatively well understood risks. The prime brokerage business is, is a well understood business, and so it was surprising that a number of them would have had this. And it was essentially, I believe, the fact that, that they had the same big risk position on with a number of firms, and they weren't-some of the firms were not aware that there were other firms that had those things. I, I wouldn't say it's in any way an indictment of our supervision of these firms. It, it-in some cases, it may be they were-it seems as though there were risk-management breakdowns at some of the firms, not all of them. And that's what we're looking into. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Nancy Marshall-Genzer. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. I-I'm wondering, are you planning to visit the homeless encampment that's near the Fed in Washington that you drive by? Have you been invited, and if you went, what would you be looking to learn there? CHAIR POWELL. You know, frankly, yes. I have not had a chance to do it yet, but I've been very busy, but I will visit. I don't want to visit it at a time of a lot of media attention, because I don't want that to be part of the story. But I will-I will go visit when, when it's no longer a, a news story. And I-you know, I-I've met with homeless people many times, a number of times, anyway, let's say. And I, I think it's always good to talk to people and hear what's going on in their lives. What you find out is, they're you. They're just us. I mean, they're, they're-these are people who, in many cases, had jobs and, you know, they have lives, and they've just, they've just found themselves in this place. It's, it's a-it's a difficult problem, April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 18 of 29 though. You know, there are many, many facets of it, and I'm well aware that this is not something that the Fed has all the tools for or anything like that. But I, I will do that when, when the need arises and when, when it's not so much, you know, in the public eye. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. And is there anything specifically that you would be looking to learn there? CHAIR POWELL. Not really. I mean, I, I think I know what I'll find there. I, I think you, you connect with these people and what you-again, what you find is, they're like you. That could be you. I mean, that could be your sister. That could be, you know, your kid. You, you always feel that way in that sort of an encounter, and, you know, it just is a-it's a-it's an important thing to engage in, I think. And I think, you know, we bring that understanding into our lives and, frankly, into our work-the work that we do as well. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Hannah Lang. HANNAH LANG. Hi. I wanted to ask about digital currency. You previously said a few times that you think it's important for the U.S. to get a central bank digital currency right rather than be first. But with countries like China moving very quickly on CBDC, I was wondering what you think the risks are of, of moving too slow on, on digital currency. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So I think the first thing to say is that we feel an obligation to understand the technology and all of the policy issues very, very well. Central bank digital currencies are now possible, and we're going to see some of them around the world. And we need to understand whether that's something that would be a good thing for the people that we serve. How would it work in our system? And there are some very, very difficult questions to answer, but I think we-and we are engaged in a serious program to understand both the technology and the policy issues. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 19 of 29 I am-I would say this: We're the world's reserve currency, and that means that the dollar is used in transactions all around the world, far more than any other currency. And that's because of our rule of law; our democratic institutions, which are the best in the world; our economy; our industrious people; all the things that make the United States the United States. That's why we're the, the reserve currency. And, of course, we have open capital accounts, which is essential if you're going to be the reserve currency. So those are the factors that make us the reserve currency. I am-I'm less concerned that someone-that another country might have a digital currency first. You know, ask yourself the question, does that mean that, if you were a company that's doing international business, would you then suddenly start to use that currency to use your-do your international transactions, or would you still do them in dollars, where, where- which is what everyone does? And I'm not so concerned about, about that. I am really concerned about getting it right. It is-it is a-it is a tricky set of questions that we have to navigate in a world where we already have, remember, a highly evolved payment system. We have FedNow and other immediately available funds. Pretty soon everybody will be able to, to do what people do in other parts of the world, which is just use their phone to make immediately available payments all the time. It'll be normal. And what would be the role of a central bank digital currency in that kind of an environment? Far more important to get it right than it is to do it fast or feel that we need to rush to reach conclusions because other countries are moving ahead. I mean, that-what the China-the currency that's being used in China is not one that would-that would work here. It's, it's one that really allows the government to see every payment that's used-for which it is used in real time. It's much more to do with things that are April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 20 of 29 happening within their own financial system than it is, I think, to do with, with the global-you know, sort of global competition. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask you another question about inflation, and it has to do with inflation expectations. A number of different surveys and, and market indicators are showing, you know, multiyear highs in inflation expectations ratings. So I wondered, you know, if, if that was something that you saw consistent with your inflation outlook. Is that something that worries you, or do you see that as, maybe, you know, the success of the Fed's new inflation framework, you know, making it out to the, to the broader public? CHAIR POWELL. Right. Inflation expectations before the pandemic hit-and here we think of survey, market based-survey being either households or, or economists and, and market based. You look at all of those, and I would say that they were at the low end of what would have been consistent with a 2 percent inflation target, particularly our 2 percent inflation target, which calls for 2 percent average inflation. So they're at the low end. Inflation expectations actually went down a bit at the beginning of the pandemic, and now they've just moved back up to levels broadly-that, that are where they were in 2018, or in some cases 2014, and, I would say, more consistent with our mandate. And we want them to be-we want them to be higher and-you know, on a persistent basis. We want inflation to run a little bit higher than it has been running for the last quarter of a century. We want it to average 2 percent, not 1.7 percent. And for that, we need to see inflation expectations that are consistent with that, really well anchored at 2 percent. We don't really see that yet, but I would say that, that, you know, breakevens have moved up, in a way. Breakevens April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 21 of 29 are based on CPI, of course, but they're, they're now at levels that are-that are pretty close to mandate consistent, whereas before, they were below. We monitor inflation expectations very, very carefully, as you would obviously know. So that's where-that's where I would say it is. MICHAEL DERBY. Just one small follow-up. Do you have any redlines on inflation readings where if, you know, you hit, like, a certain number on, say, you know, core PCE, that would be, you know, a trigger response from the Fed? CHAIR POWELL. It doesn't work that way. You know, we're, we're-inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile. We expect-as I mentioned, we expect core and, and headline PCE to move up because of base effects, and-you know, I-and we expect that to go away. We, we also expect these, these bottleneck effects to come in. We don't know how persistent they'll be. We, we think they'll-you know, it's a matter of, of when they will pass through, not whether they will pass through. But we can't be confident about the exact timing of that or the size of them. They don't seem especially large at the moment, but, you know, we, we don't know. I mean, you know, this is-this is all about the reopening of the economy. That's what's happening. We had it-we were in a deep, deep hole a year ago, and now, with a lot of help from fiscal policy, some additional help from monetary policy, and, you know, a great deal of help from vaccination, we're seeing a strong rebound in activity. And what's happening is, it's, it's-demand can be spurred with fiscal transfers and-the saved-up fiscal transfers and, and people going back to work and things like that. The supply side will take a little bit of time to adapt. New restaurants will have to be opened. The supply of various inputs into the goods part of the economy will have to be brought back up to speed. And you-you're seeing some of that. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 22 of 29 That'll happen over a period of time, over coming quarters. You'll see some of the bottlenecks resolved, but the last one may not be resolved for some time. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Brian Cheung. BRIAN CHEUNG. Brian Cheung with-hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. I wanted to ask about financial stability, which is a part of the Fed's reaction function here. It seems like to people on the outside who might not follow finance daily, they're paying attention to things like GameStop, now Dogecoin. And it seems like there's interesting reach for yield in this market-to some extent, also Archegos. So does the Fed see a relationship between low rates and easy policy to those things, and is there a financial stability concern from the Fed's perspective at this time? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So we look at-financial stability for us is really-we have a broad framework, so we don't just jump from one thing to another. I know many people just look at asset prices, and they look at some of the things that are going on in the-in the equity markets, which, which I think do reflect froth in the equity markets. But really, it-really, we try to stick to a framework for financial stability so we can-so we can talk about it the same way each time and so we can be held accountable for it. So one of the areas is asset prices, and I would say some of the asset prices are high. You are seeing, seeing things in the capital markets that, that are-that are a bit frothy. That's a fact. I won't say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but it also-it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy. That's really what has been moving markets a lot in the last few months is this turn away from what was a pretty dark winter to now a fast-a much faster vaccination process and a faster reopening. So that's, that's part of what's going on. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 23 of 29 The other-the other things, though-you know, leverage in the financial system, is it- is, is not a problem. That's a-that's a-that was one of the four pillars. Asset prices was one. Leverage in the financial system is, is not an issue; we have very well capitalized large banks. We have funding risks for, for our largest financial institutions that are also very low. We do have some funding risk issues around money market funds, but I would say they're not systemic right now. And, and the household sector is actually in pretty good shape. It was in-it was in a very good shape as a relative matter before the financial crisis-sorry, the pandemic crisis hit. There were real concerns, of course, with high levels of unemployment and loss of wages and all of that, that the-that the household sector would, would, would weaken dramatically. That hasn't happened. So, with the fiscal transfers, money that's on household balance sheets, they're in good shape. You see relatively low defaults and that kind of thing. So the overall financial stability picture is mixed, but, on balance, it's-you know, it's manageable, I would say. And it's-by the way, I think it's appropriate and important for financial conditions to remain accommodative to support economic activity. Again, 8½ million people who had jobs in February don't have them now, and, you know, there's a long way to go until we reach our goal. So that's what I would say. BRIAN CHEUNG. As a follow-up, you mentioned money market pressures. The Fed didn't make changes to interest on reserves or excess reserves. What was the logic behind that? It seems like SOFR has been drifting closer to zero. So just hoping for clarification on that. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So the federal funds rate has been well within target and-at target range, and money market funds-money market conditions are, are fine. We have the ability to use our administrative tools to make sure that that remains the case. We do expect April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 24 of 29 further downward pressure on, on rates through asset purchases and also the runoff in the-in the Treasury General Account. But, at this point, we didn't see a need for-to, to deploy our tools to, to support rates. And, of course, we will do so if, if the need does arise. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jean Yung. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask a, a similar question. We are seeing elevated market valuations, and some economists are concerned that the economy might overheat, at least for a period of time. So should the Fed and other regulators be thinking about tightening capital requirements or extending oversight to the nonbank sector so that financial stability risks stay as low as they have been? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I think capital requirements for banks are, to me-went up tremendously, really, over the course of the 10 years between the financial crisis and the arrival of the pandemic. And the banks really made it through a real stress test very well and passed three, three of our-two of our stress tests, and that is another one that's pending. So capital is, is in a good place, as far as I'm concerned, in the banking system. But, to your point, what we saw was-so what, what kind of happened during the pandemic crisis that, that requires attention, and number one is money market funds and corporate bond funds where we saw run dynamics again, and we need to-we're, we're looking at that. So we're looking at ways, and people around the world are looking at ways, to make those vehicles resilient so that they don't have to be, you know, supported by the government whenever there's, you know, severely stressed market conditions. It's a private business. They, they need to have the wherewithal to stay in business and not just count on the Fed and others to-around the world to come in. So that was that. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 25 of 29 The other one is Treasury market structure. Dealers are committing less capital to that activity now than they were 10 or 15 years ago, and the need for capital is higher because there's so much more supply of Treasuries. And so there are some questions about Treasury market structure, and there's a lot of careful work going on to understand whether there's something we can do about this, because we-you know, the U.S. Treasury market is probably the most single important-single most important market in, in the economy and the world. It needs to be liquid. It needs to function well for the good of our economy and the good of our citizens. So it's not clear what, what-where that takes you, but we, we are taking a careful look-and the Treasury Department is, is really going to be leading this-at, at Treasury market structure and all of the various aspects of that to make sure that we do have a resilient, strong Treasury market that can work even in difficult times. As, as you know, at the very beginning of the financial-of the-of this recent crisis, there was such a demand for selling Treasuries, including by foreign central banks, that, really, the dealers couldn't handle the volume. And so what was happening was, the market was really starting to lose function, and that's-that was a really serious problem which we had to solve through really massive asset purchases. And, you know, so we'd like to, we'd like to see if there isn't something we can do to-is-do we need to build against that kind of an extreme tail risk, and if so, what would that look like? MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Fed Chairman, for the question. So I'm interested in your thoughts. There's so much fiscal help and accommodation from the Federal Reserve. You said today the vaccinations will follow the normal economic conditions or, or lead to more normal economic conditions later this year. When do you see the economy being able to stand on its own feet, so to speak? And, along those lines, with the fiscal spending and the April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 26 of 29 accommodation you talked about with transitory inflation, does more spending need to be injected into the system, or will that affect that transitory nation-nature of the inflation? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. When will the economy be, be able to stand on its own feet? I'm not sure if-I'm not sure what the exact nature of that question is. EDWARD LAWRENCE. What, what I'm saying is, is, you know, when will the-when will you need to lower the, the amount of Treasuries you're buying to sort of taper off a little bit? When can it stand without having that support from the monetary policy side? And then-and then, further, the transitory. CHAIR POWELL. Okay. Sorry. So we have-you know, we've articulated our test for that, as you know, and that is just, we'll continue asset purchases at this pace until we see substantial further progress. And we're, we're going to communicate well in advance of any decision. We're going to let, you know, the, the public know that that's what we're thinking. And, and so there'll be a lot of warning and that kind of thing. But it's about substantial further progress toward our goals. That's, that's really all it is. It doesn't have any, any external, virusrelated specific requirement, although, again, I do think it'll-you know, the, the virus will need to continue to be controlled for us to achieve those economic goals. But it's really the economic goals. Now, your second question. Sorry, just say again. I didn't quite get that question. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Yes, sure. With all the fiscal spending that's happened and the accommodation and-does, does the system need more spending either from the fiscal side or accommodation, or would more spending affect the transitory nature of the inflation and put those upward, upward pressures on inflation long term? April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 27 of 29 CHAIR POWELL. So it's really up to Congress. We-we're not an adviser to Congress. You know, we don't, we don't weigh in on specific fiscal bills or proposals. That's really between elected parties. You know, basically, fiscal policy is the province of people who stand for democratic election and win, and they get to make those very difficult decisions, and they get to be accountable to the voters. We didn't do any of that, and we don't have a seat at that table. We don't seek a seat at that table. So that's really something for Congress and the Administration to, to deal with. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Hi, Greg Robb from MarketWatch. Thank you-thank you so much for the-for the opportunity. I wanted to circle back to the housing market. It's just kind of confusing that the question and your answer-you know, the housing market is strong, prices are up. And yet the Fed is buying $40 billion per month in mortgage-related assets. Why is that, and are those purchases playing a role at all in pushing up prices? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. I, I mean, we're-we started buying MBS because the mortgage-backed security market was, was really experiencing severe dysfunction, and we've sort of, sort of articulated, you know, what our exit path is from that. It's not meant to provide direct assistance to, to the housing market. That was never the intent. It was really just to keep that as-it's a very close relation to the Treasury market and a very important market on its own. And so that's, that's why we, we bought as we did during the Global Financial Crisis; we bought MBS too. Again, not, not an intention to send help to the housing market, which was, which was really not, not a problem this time at all. So-and, you know, it's, it's a situation where we will, we will taper asset purchases when the time comes to do that, and those, those purchases will come to zero over time. And that time is not yet. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 28 of 29 GREG ROBB. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. And for the last question, we'll go to Mike McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since I am last, let me go back to Paul's question, the first question, and ask him-ask you whether-not whether you're thinking about thinking of tapering, but why you're not. We're seeing bank lending fall. The markets seem to be operating well. Are you afraid of a taper tantrum? Or is it, as one money manager put it, ""If you get out of the markets, there aren't enough buyers for all of the Treasury debt, and so rates would have to go way up""? The bottom-line question is, what do we get for $120 billion a month that we couldn't get for less? CHAIR POWELL. So it's really not more complicated than this. We, we articulated the ""substantial further progress"" test at our December meeting. And, really, for the next couple of months, we made relatively little progress toward our goals. And, remember, substantial further progress from December-from our December meeting. And then vaccination started to get more widespread. The economy reopened. We got a really nice job report for March. It doesn't constitute substantial further progress. It's not close to substantial further progress. We're hopeful that we will see along this path a way to that goal. And we believe we will; it just is a question of when. And so, when that time-when the time comes for us to talk about talking about it, we'll do that. And-but that time is not now. It's-we're just not-we're not that far. We've had one great jobs report. It's not enough. You know, we're going to act on actual data, not on our forecast. And we're just going to need to see more data. That's-it's no, no more complicated than that. April 28, 2021 Chair Powell's Press Conference FINAL Page 29 of 29 MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if you leave rates where they are, it doesn't change anything. But does it change anything if you actually tapered a bit? If you spent less, would you still get the same effect on the economy? CHAIR POWELL. If we bought less? You're, you're very faint. So if someone has the volume, they can turn it up. But if we bought less, you know, no. I mean, I think the effect is proportional to the amount we buy. It's, it's really part of overall accommodative financial conditions. We, we have tried to create accommodative financial conditions to support economic activity, and we did that. And we articulated the-you know, the, the tests for withdrawing that accommodation. And we think, you know-so we're waiting to see those tests to be fulfilled both for asset purchases and for liftoff of rates. And, you know, when the tests are fulfilled, we'll, we'll go ahead. As we-you know, we've done this before. We did it in, in the last-after the last crisis, and, you know, we'll do it in, in maybe-we'll do it-as those tests are satisfied, we'll do it. And the-and the only thing that will guide us is, are the tests met? You know, that, that's what we focused on: Is-have, have the macroeconomic conditions that we've articulated, have they been realized? That will be the test for, for tapering asset purchases and for raising interest rates. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you very much. Take care. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel Siegel, the Washington Post. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can walk us through expectations you have, specifically when it comes to the labor market going into 2023. And I'm curious about people who may have left the labor market, who have yet to come back, or who may face issues with childcare. Perhaps they've retired early. Any barriers that you see in keeping people from the labor market as you consider full employment going into 2023? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. So I would say, if you look at the labor market and you look at the demand for workers and the level of job creation and think ahead, I think it's clear, and I am confident, that we are on a path to a very strong labor market-a labor market that, that shows low unemployment, high participation, rising wages for people across the spectrum. I mean, I think that's, that's shown in our projections, it's shown in outside projections. And if you look through the current time frame and think one and two years out, we're going to be looking at a very, very strong labor market. In terms of exactly what that means, we'll, we'll have to see how things evolve. I think we learned during the course of the last very long expansion, the longest in our history, that labor supply during a long expansion can exceed expectations, can move above its estimated trend. And, and I have no reason to think that that won't happen again. At the same time, we have seen-in terms of participation, we've seen a significant number of, of people retire. And so we, we don't actually know exactly what labor force participation will be as we go forward, but I, I would tend to, to look at it and think that it-that it can return to high levels, although it may take some time to do that. But overall, this is-this is going to be, you know, a very strong labor market. In terms of the near term, you ask as well-so we see a couple of things, a few things that seem likely to be holding back labor supply. There are very large amounts of job openings, and there are a very large number of people who, who are unemployed. And the pace of, of filling those jobs is-somehow feels slower than it might be. So I'd point to a number of things, the first of which is just that most of the, the act of sort of going back to one's old job-that's kind of already happened. So this is a question of people finding a new job. And that's just a process that takes longer. There may be something of a speed limit on it. You've got to find a job where, where your skills match what, you know, what, what the employer wants. It's got to be in the right area. There's just a lot that goes into the function of finding a job. So that's, that's sort of a natural thing. In addition, I would say that we, we look at, for example, a, a significant number of people still say that they're concerned about going back to work in jobs where there's a lot of public facing because of-because of COVID. So that's clearly holding back some people, and that should diminish as vaccinations move ahead. There's also the question of childcare. Many are engaged in, in caretaking. And as schools reopen and, and, and childcare/daycare centers open in the fall-in the fall, then we should see-we should see that supporting labor force participation by caretakers. Finally, unemployment insurance for something like 15 million people will either end or be diminished as we move through the summer and into, into, into the fall by the end of September, and I'd like some-that may also encourage some to go back in and take jobs. So you would think that that would add to an increase in job creation as well. So you put all those together, I would expect that we would see strong job creation building up over the summer and going into-going into the fall. I will also say, though, the last thing I'll say is, this is an extraordinarily unusual time. And we, we really don't have a template or, or, you know, any experience of, of a situation like this. And so I think we have to be humble about our ability to understand the data. It's not a time to try to reach hard conclusions about the labor market, about inflation, about the path of policy. We need to see more data. We need to be a little bit patient. And I do think, though, that we'll, we'll, we'll be seeing some things coming up in coming months that will-that will inform our, our thinking. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Paul Kiernan. PAUL KIERNAN. Hi, Chairman Powell. Thanks for the question. Your-the Committee's median forecast on inflation seems to assume a pretty, pretty tame outlook for the rest of the year. As you know, the three-month annualized rate for the past three months was, I think, 8.4 percent in the CPI. And I'm just wondering sort of how much longer we can sustain those, those kinds of rates before you get nervous. Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So inflation has come in above expectations over the last few months. But if you look behind the headline numbers, you'll see that the incoming data are, are consistent with the view that prices-that prices that are driving that higher inflation are from categories that are being directly affected by the recovery from the pandemic and the reopening of the economy. So, for example, the experience with, with lumber prices is, is illustrative of this. The thought is that prices like that that have moved up really quickly because of the shortages and bottlenecks and the like, they should stop going up, and at some point, they, they, in some cases, should actually go down. And we did see that in the case of lumber. Another example where we haven't seen that yet is prices for used cars, which accounted for more than a third of the total increase in core inflation. Used car prices are going up because of sort of a perfect storm of very strong demand and limited supply. It's going up at just an amazing annual rate. But we do think that it makes sense that that would stop, and that in fact it would reverse over time. So we think we'll be seeing some of that. When will we be seeing it? We're not sure. That narrative seems, still seems quite likely to prove correct, although, you know, as I pointed out at the last press conference, the, the timing of that is, is pretty uncertain, and so are the, the effects in the near term. But over time, it seems likely that these very specific things that are driving up inflation will be-will be temporary. And we'll be, you know, we're going to be looking. We'll be looking at the monthly pricing data. I'll, I'll also say that the labor market is going to be important, both for the maximum-employment goal, but also for inflation. And we'll be looking at that. And, and as I-as I mentioned, we expect and I expect that we'll see increases in supply over coming months as the factors that we believe have been suppressing supply abate, wane, move down. So I, I can't give you an exact number or an exact time, but I would say that we do expect inflation to move down. If you look at the-if you look at the forecast for 2021 and-sorry, 2022 and 2023 among my colleagues on the, on the Federal Open Market Committee, you will see that people do expect inflation to move down meaningfully toward our goal. And I think the full range of, of, of inflation projections for 2023 falls between 2 and 2.3 percent, which is consistent with our-with our goals. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Ylan Mui at CNBC. YLAN MUI. Hi. Thank you, Chair Powell, for doing this. My question for you is that you mentioned that your colleagues did have a discussion about the progress that you're making toward your, your goals in order to consider tapering your asset purchases. In that discussion, you said that you didn't-haven't made substantial progress yet, but that you expect to continue to make progress. In that discussion, did you guys talk about a timeline for when you expect to see that progress be made and when you might consider starting to reduce those purchases? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So I, I expect that we'll be able to say more about timing as we see more data. Basically, there's not a lot of more light I can-I can shed on that. But you can think of this meeting that we had as the ""talking about talking about"" meeting, if you like. And I now suggest that we retire that term, which has-which has served its purpose well, I think. So Committee participants were of the view that since we adopted that guidance in December, the economy has clearly made progress, although we are still a ways from our goal of substantial further progress. Participants expect continued progress ahead toward that objective. And assuming that is the case, it will be appropriate to consider announcing a plan for reducing our asset purchases at a future meeting. So at coming meetings, the Committee will continue to assess the economy's progress toward our goals, and we'll give advance notice before announcing any decision. The timing, of course, Ylan, will depend on the pace of that progress and not on any calendar. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Chris Rugaber, AP. CHRIS RUGABER. Right. Thank you. Well, you mentioned-let me ask about inflation expectations. You said they were-I think you mentioned in your opening statement that you saw them as within target. Does that mean that some of the shorter-term measures we've seen out there such as the New York Federal Reserve's three-year outlook, which jumped a bit-should those sort of be dismissed? And are we only looking at longer-term inflation expectations? And would you describe those as still well anchored at this point? And on a related note, would the Fed consider publishing its index of common inflation expectations on a monthly basis? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we, we do tend to look at the longer-term inflation expectations, because that's really, we think, what matters for, for inflation. So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices. So you'll see if gasoline prices were to spike, you'll see the shorter-term inflation expectation measures, particularly the surveys, move up. And, and that's, that's maybe not a good signal for future inflation if, if gas happens to spike and then go back down again. So we-yes, I think if, if you look at the broad range of longer-term inflation expectations, they've moved up. They moved down during the beginning of the pandemic, you know, sort of further exacerbating concerns that we might find ourselves where, for example, the ECB and the Bank of Japan have been, where you have expectations and inflation itself sliding down and you have a really hard time stopping that process once it begins. So that was a concern. So it's, it's good, actually, to see inflation-longer-term inflation expectations move back up to a range-it's a range that's consistent with what our objectives are. These are not precise measures, and that's-and they, they contain risk premiums of various kinds. And that's why we look at a broad range of them and tend to look at the movement of that broad range of, of, of indicators, which are from, you know, surveys of economists, surveys of the public, and also market based. It's, it's, it's a wide index, as I'm sure you know. We look at that, and we see them back in the range where they were. And, by the way, they've been broadly higher than that, somewhat modestly higher than that, not so many years ago, at a time when inflation was, was, was still anchored at around 2 percent or maybe even a little bit below. So the answer is, yes, I think they are anchored and they're at a good place right now. It's gratifying to see them having moved up off of their pandemic lows. And, you know, as you know, it's, it's fundamental in our framework, our new framework, to, to assure that inflation-longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a place that is consistent with our goal. We, we think that's an important reason. If, if inflation expectations are not anchored at a place that's consistent with your goal, it's not clear why you would expect to hit your goal over the longer term. So it's important. MICHELLE SMTH. Okay, now we'll go to James Politi with the FT. JAMES POLITI. Chair Powell-thanks, Chair Powell. Your economic projections today forecast 7 percent growth in 2022, unemployment at 4½ percent, and core inflation of 3 percent. If those conditions are achieved by the end of the year, would that constitute substantial further progress, in your mind? And kind of more broadly, when you look at the sort of median forecast for interest rates in 2023 showing not one but two interest rate increases at the time, I mean, is this kind of-can you describe the sort of tone of the-of the discussion in the Committee? And are we really moving towards sort of a post-pandemic stance? Is there greater confidence that, you know, the recovery will be, you know, a full recovery sooner than expected? CHAIR POWELL. On your first question, the judgment of when we have arrived at substantial further progress is one that the Committee will make. And it would not be appropriate for me to lay out particular numbers that do or do not-that do or do not qualify. That is-that is, you know, the process that we're beginning now at the next meeting. We will begin, meeting by meeting, to, to assess that progress and talk about what we-what we think we're seeing and, and just do all of the things that you do to sort of clarify your thinking around the process of deciding whether and how to adjust the pace and composition of asset purchases. In terms of the, the, the two hikes-so let me say a couple things first of all, not for the first time, about the-about the dot plot. These are, of course, individual projections. They're not a Committee forecast, they're not a plan. And we did not actually have a discussion of whether liftoff is appropriate at any particular year, because discussing liftoff now would be-would be highly premature, wouldn't make any sense. If you look at the transcripts from five years ago, you'll see that sometimes people mention their rate path in their interventions. Often they don't. And the last thing to say is, the dots are not a great forecaster of, of future rate moves. And that's not because-it's just because it's so highly uncertain. There is no great forecaster of, of future dots. So, so dots to be taken with a-with a big, big grain of salt. However, so let me talk about this, this, this meeting. The Committee spelled out, as you know, in our FOMC statements the conditions that it expects to see before an adjustment in the target range is made. And it's outcome based, it's not time based. And, as I mentioned, it's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to exceed 2 percent. In the projections, it gives some sense of how participants see the economy evolving in their most likely case. And, honestly, the main message I would take away from the SEP is that participants-many, many participants are more comfortable that the economic conditions in the Committee's forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously anticipated. And that would be a welcome development. If such outcomes materialize, it means the economy will have made faster progress toward our goals. So the other thing I'll say is, rate increases are really not at all the focus of the Committee. The focus of the Committee is the current state of the economy. But in terms of our tools, it's about asset purchases. That's what we're thinking about. Liftoff is, is well into the future. The conditions for liftoff-we're very far from maximum employment, for example. It's, it's a consideration for the future. So the near-term thing is really-the real near-term discussion, discussion that will begin is really about the, the path of asset purchases. And, as I mentioned, we had a discussion about that today and expect to, in future meetings, continue to think about our progress. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer from Marketplace. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Continuing-Chair Powell, continuing in that vein, when you're ready, how will you go about signaling the start of tapering when you do decide to do that? CHAIR POWELL. So our intention for this process is that it will be orderly, methodical, and transparent. And I can just tell you, we, we, we see real value in communicating well in advance what our thinking is. And we'll try to be clear. And, as I mentioned, we'll, we'll give advance notice before announcing a decision to taper. And so all I can say is that we, we think it's important-we think where the balance sheet's concerned, a lot of notice, as much transparency as we can give, and as far-as far in advance as we can to give people a chance to adjust their expectations. And, you know, we expect to be in that business until we reach substantial further progress and then have a-have a decision. Again, I have nothing further on time. It wouldn't be appropriate to say. We're going to have to see more data. We're a ways away from substantial further progress, we think. But we're making progress. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So you can't say generally how far in advance you would signal? CHAIR POWELL. Again, as we-as we approach that goal, we'll provide, you know, as much clarity as we can. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Going to Craig Torres at Bloomberg. CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres at Bloomberg. If I were a businessman looking at the forecast today, I would ask how and when the Fed seeks to achieve an average of 2 percent inflation. In other words, does the FOMC have a look-back period? Or does it plan to suppress inflation in outer years because, over the next three years, you're going to be above inflation? So what is your look-back period? Does the Committee have one? And if not, why not? And if they don't, why isn't this just flexible inflation targeting without an average in a range of 2 to 2¼ percent? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. You know, so as part of our year-and-a-half-long process, the review that we did and came out with at the end of that with the-with the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, we looked carefully at the idea. We've all read all the literature around different formulas for makeup and things like that. And we concluded-and, you know, I strongly agree-that it's not wise to, to wed yourself to a particular formulation of that. So we did adopt a discretionary-there's an element of discretion in it. You know, it says that we will seek to-seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time. And it's, it's meant to create a broad sense that we want inflation to average 2 percent over time. And that under the old-under the old formula, under the old framework, what was happening was, 2 percent was a ceiling because all of the errors were below. You were always getting back to 2 percent. So you were bouncing back and forth between 1½ and 2, and we wanted them to be centered around 2. So, so that's, that's the approach that we're taking. And you're right, it's not-it's not a formulaic approach. We were clear on that when we announced the framework. Was there another part of your question, Craig? CRAIG TORRES. That pretty much answers it, Chair Powell. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask you about the reverse repo usage that we've seen lately. I was curious if you are at all concerned about the level of money flowing into the reverse repo facility. And do you believe that the changes in the Fed's rate control toolkit today will have any impact on that? And then, in a related question, do you think that Fed asset purchases are taking too many safe assets out of the market right now and creating maybe some dislocations in the money markets? CHAIR POWELL. So on the-on the facility, we think it's doing its job. We think it's doing-the reverse repo facility is, is doing what it's supposed to do, which is to provide a floor under money market rates and keep the federal funds rate well within its-well within its range. So we're not concerned with it. It's doing-you have an unusual situation where the Treasury General Account is, is shrinking and bill supply is shrinking. And so there's, there's downward pressure-we're buying assets-there's downward pressure on short-term rates, and that facility is, is doing what we think it's supposed to do. Sorry, your second question was again? MICHAEL DERBY. Yeah, I mean, the change in the rate control toolkit, will that have any impact on-do you think that will reduce the, the amount of money coming into reverse repos? Will that have any impact on money market conditions that, you know, beyond the fed funds rate setting? CHAIR POWELL. It could have some impact. I think we'll have to see empirically. But it's designed to keep the federal funds rate, you know, within the range. And I do think it could have some effect on, on broader money market conditions below as it relates to, you know, the very low rates and the downward pressures. MICHAEL DERBY. And will it-do think it will lower uptake on the reverse repo facility, or that's just not even really a focus of what the change was? CHAIR POWELL. It's not, honestly. And, you know, the funny thing, you would think that it would, but we'll have to see. It's, it's possible that that would not be the case. That's going to be an empirical question. MICHAEL DERBY. Okay, cool. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. We'll go to Jeanna Smialek, the New York Times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on your response to Rachel at the very beginning and talk a little bit about how we should understand what full employment means in a world that, as you mentioned, is pretty roiled. All the data is pretty-has been pretty roiled by the pandemic, and we're not really sure where EPOP is going to settle in, we're not sure where participation is going to settle in. And wages are already looking, you know, decent. So I guess I wonder what full employment means in this context and, and sort of how you're thinking about those wage data. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. As, as you well know, there isn't one indicator we can look to, and there's no one number that we can therefore point to. We look at a range of indicators, and it's a very broad range, you can count to a high number just quickly-but, but, certainly, it will include things like unemployment and participation and wages and many different flavors of that. So how do we think about it? A couple of things. We're all going to be informed by what we saw in the last cycle, which was labor supply outperforming expectations over a long period of time. Now, that hadn't happened in many other cycles, but this was a very long cycle. So we're going to have to be alert to see whether that can happen again. It is a different-it's a different economy. We, we have had a slew of retirements, and that may weigh on participation. That, that effect, though, should wear off in a few years and, and, you know, as you move through that window, because they would have-people would have retired anyway, and you'll be back where you, you would have been. So I think we're-I think that lesson number one is, is just to be careful about assessing maximum employment. And I think if you-during the last cycle, there were-there were waves of concern that we were reaching full employment as early, you know, as, as 2012, when I arrived at the Fed. And, you know-you know, nine years later-eight years later, we were still creating jobs. And, you know, it was quite remarkable. So we're all going to be informed by that. At the same time, we understand this is a different economy. You know, the, the demographics are, people are getting older, and that should have a secular effect of, of reducing participation over time. So we have to be sensible about what, what can be done. But I think we're going to be-we're going to lean into that and be optimistic. You asked about wages. You know, we're seeing wage increases. That's, that's sort of a natural thing to be seeing in a strong economy. And what we're seeing is-we don't see anything that's troubling in the sense of-what would be troubling would be, you know, very wide across the economy, wages at unsustainable levels without high inflation. In other words, wages in excess of productivity and inflation, you know, by a meaningful amount broadly across the economy, sort of forcing companies to keep raising prices and getting into a wage-price cycle. That's, that's the old formula for-one of the old formulas for having high inflation. We don't see anything like that now. We do see high wages. We see them for, for people who are mostly new, you know, entering into new jobs, many of them in low-skilled jobs. And, but we, we do think-you've got to-you've got to think in the labor market right now, where, where supply and demand are just not matched up well. And, you know, we think it's a flexible economy and, and it will clear. There will-there will be a level at which supply and demand meet. And that'll-we think that'll, that'll be happening in coming months. So-but the last thing I'll say is, again, if you look at, at the forecasts, we are going to be in a very strong labor market pretty quickly here. There are still a big group of unemployed people. And, you know, we're not going to forget about them. We're going-we're going to do everything we can to get people back into work and give them the chance to work. But there's every reason to think that we'll be in a-in a labor market with very attractive numbers, with low unemployment, high participation, and rising wages across the spectrum. So that's, that's a little bit how we're looking at the-at the labor market. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. HANNAH LANG. Hi, I wanted to ask about the status of your thinking around the supplementary leverage ratio right now. Is the Fed still thinking about ways to permanently adjust this to account for the high growth in deposits? And do you ultimately believe a permanent fix is needed? And any information on the timing around that would be-would be helpful. CHAIR POWELL. What I can say is, we're working on it. I don't have anything to share with you in terms of the particulars or the timing right now, unfortunately. But we've, we've always-our position has been for a long time and, and it is now that we'd, we'd like the leverage ratio to be a backstop to risk-based capital requirements. When leverage requirements are, are, are binding, it does skew incentives for firms to substitute lower-risk assets for high-risk ones. It's a straightforward thing. And because of the substantial increase in reserves, Treasuries, and other safe assets in the banking system, the SLR is rapidly ceasing to become-ceasing to be the intended backstop for big firms that we want it to be. So we do think it's appropriate to consider ways to adapt it to this new high-reserves environment, and, and we're looking hard at the issue. We would also, just to be really clear, we will take whatever actions are necessary to assure that any changes we do make or recommend do not erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements. Sorry, I can't give you any more. That's just something we're working on. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Anneken Tappe at CNN Business. ANNEKEN TAPPE. Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Chairman Powell, the price jumps we've seen in some raw materials-lumber, for example, you mentioned that earlier-seem to be easing. And it looks like we're at the beginning of suppliers catching up with demand. But I wonder if you're worried at all, if we're going to end up with excess supply immediately after those shortages wear off and if we just continue this mismatch, as we're recovering and getting out of the pandemic economy. And I wonder how that would affect the Fed's outlook at all. CHAIR POWELL. Well, that is really not the problem we're having right now. But-and, actually, people who work in commodity industries are very focused on that, because they know that, you know, they don't want to build, build capacity and then find out that it's not necessary. So, really, the problem now is, is that demand is very, very strong. Incomes are high, people have money in their bank accounts. Demand for goods is extremely high, and it hasn't-it hasn't come down. We're seeing the service sector reopening. And so you're seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there. But in terms of, of overcorrecting, I mean, I think there, there is a possibility on the other side of this that, that inflation could be-could actually be quite low going forward. But that's not-that's not really where our focus is right now. Our focus right now is, we need to-our, our expectation is that these, these high inflation readings that we're seeing now will start to abate. And that's, that's what we think. And it'll be like the lumber experience, and like we expect the used car experience to be. With things like airplane tickets and hotels, which are the other two factors in the most recent CPI report that went up a lot, we expect that those prices will get back up to where they were, but there's no reason to think that they're going to keep going up a lot. Because if they are, people will build new hotels. There's no reason for supply and demand to be out of whack in the hotel business over any period of time. So we think that'll happen. I think in terms of the timing and the effects on inflation in the near term, there's a lot of uncertainty. The overall story is one that, that we think is right, and we think the incoming data support it and, you know, so do many, many forecasters. And if you look at the forecasts on the FOMC, you will-you will see that as well. But we don't-we don't in any way dismiss the chance that it can work out that, that this goes on longer than expected. And the risk would be that over time, it does begin to affect inflation expectations. And if we see inflation expectations and inflation-or inflation moving up in a way that is really materially above what we-what we would see as consistent with our goals, and persistently so, we wouldn't hesitate to use our tools to address that. Price stability is half of our mandate, and we would certainly do that. We do not expect that, though. That is not our base case. And, and in that we're joined by many other forecasters, but there's a lot to be humble about among forecasters. Forecasters have a lot to be humble about. It's a-it's a highly uncertain business. And we're, we're very much attuned to the risks and, and watching the data carefully. In the meantime, I would say, you know, we should-as I mentioned earlier, there's so much uncertainty around this. It's, it's just a unique situation that we need to see how things evolve in coming months and, and see how that story holds up and act accordingly. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider, Reuters. Thanks, Chair Powell, for taking this. I don't want to miss the moment here. And I just-I noticed that in the statement you dropped the language saying that the pandemic is weighing on the economy. So is this the effective end, in your view, of the pandemic as a constraint on economic activity, even though it's still cited as a risk? CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's a-it's a continuum, right? What you've seen with the pandemic is sharply declining cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. And that's great. And, and, you know, that should continue. But, you know, you, you also saw in the United Kingdom, which has, I think, at least as high if not higher vaccination rates, they've had an outbreak of the Delta variety. And it's-and it's causing them to have to-to have to react to that. So you're not-you're not out of the woods at this point. And it would be premature to-in my thinking, it would be premature to declare victory. Vaccination still has a ways to go to get to levels-it would be good to see it get to a substantially higher level. And, you know, that can only help. So, look, I-but you're right, the statement language is evolving. I would expect it to continue to evolve. There's a lot of judgment in that. But you can expect us to drag our feet a little bit on that, because that's what you do with statement language. It's, it's great to see the progress. But, again, I would not declare victory yet. I would say it is so great to see the reopening of the economy, though, and to see people out living their lives again. You know, who doesn't want to see that? And it appears to be safe, and I just would encourage people to continue to get vaccinated. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. If I could follow up on that, if you-if you view this statement in, in toto and the-and the dots and the substance as well, do you think this is more a mark-to-market exercise around the improvement in health or around the inflation risks you see developing out there? CHAIR POWELL. I think it's both. You know, I think, clearly, since March what's happened is, people have grown more confident in these very strong outcomes, that they'll be achieved. Very strong outcomes in the economy will be achieved. There's, there's more grounds for comfort. We've seen growth coming higher than we expected. We've seen very strong labor demand. We've also seen-we have seen inflation above target, though, and I think even though, you know, in, in our forecasters' case, they do see inflation coming back down over '22 and '23 into, into areas that are very consistent with our-with our mandate. Nonetheless, the risk is, is something that can factor into people's thinking about appropriate monetary policy. The thing is, you know, these are 18 different forecasts, and I can't stand here and say exactly what was in all 18 people's minds. But that, that is something that I think can factor into things as well-factor into our forecast as well. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Victoria Guida with Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I, I wanted to ask a little bit more about inflation to make sure I understand how you're thinking about this. So in the projections, inflation is expected to, to be high this year and then come back down next year and then maybe start to rise a little bit again, enough for a liftoff in 2023. You know, I know that's obviously-you know, take that with a grain of salt. But that would suggest that you all could theoretically see inflation sustainably staying above 2 percent. And so, I guess my question is, what would be causing that inflation? What, what would be-because it seems like you all now see a situation in which inflation would be rising in a way that isn't caused by transitory factors in the-in the next couple of years. So would that be the result of a tight labor market? Would that be because this whole situation has raised people's inflation expectations? How are you thinking about that? CHAIR POWELL. So what we're seeing in the near term-again, our base case is that what we're seeing in the near term is, is principally associated with, with the reopening of the economy and not with a tight labor market or tight resource constraints, really. So-but you're right. When, when you get to-in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt. We have a very highly adaptive, you know, flexible economy, more so than most. And by 2023, those increases are really about, about, you know, rising resource utilization or, to put it a different way, you know, low unemployment, or high employment is a way to think about it. So that's what that's about. That's about the kind of broad inflationary pressure that results from, you know, a really strong expansion tightening up resource utilization across the whole economy and lifting, lifting up inflation. And that's why-that's why you would see it then, because by then, you know, in the forecast-and it's just a forecast, they're just individual forecasts. In people's forecasts, that's what's happening. VICTORIA GUIDA. So the, the, the change in the projections reflect the fact that you all are more optimistic about the economic outlook, and not necessarily that you think that this will change the way people think about inflation? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, I think-there may be an element of the latter as well, because inflation expectations have continued to move up. You know, it's all in people's individual thinking, and you can't-it's hard to say. It's not something the Committee debates in terms of, you know, what, what the outlook is for 2023. So I'm, I'm a little bit speculating, which I shouldn't do. But it wouldn't surprise me if there's an element for some people in, you know, seeing the inflation performance that we've had and thinking that I have more confidence that we could see inflation above 2 percent, that it may not be as hard to do that as we thought, and that inflation expectations may move up to a-to a level-they were-they were really at a level that was kind of a little below 2 percent. They might move up as a consequence of this or, or, or as a consequence of, of, of the new framework. You know, we did see inflation expectations moving up in the-in the wake of the announcement of the framework. But, you know, we don't really know that. So, ultimately, I think it's consistent with both those things. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch. GREG ROBB. Hi. Hi, thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I'm just looking at the forecast, and one thing I just don't think has been talked about all that much is how much you guys-the Fed thinks that the economy is going to slow next year. I mean, are we looking at a scenario of a slowing economy next year with higher inflation? And, and what do you think about that? CHAIR POWELL. We're looking at an economy that will not have the degree of, of fiscal support. The fiscal support in the forecast is much less than it was this year. So-but you've, you've still got a very strong growth, well above the longer-run potential output of the-of the economy. You've got-you've got growth meaningfully above that, and inflation is lower next year in all of our-in all of our forecasts. I think the range of, of core PCE forecast for next year is 1.7 to 2.5 in 2022 and, and 2 to 2.3 in 2023. So you're right, you're seeing-I, I can't remember the number, but it might be in the 3s-3, 3½ percent growth for next year. That's, that's a really good year-coming on the back of a 7 percent growth year, that's a really good year. That's, that's a year with a lot of momentum. That'll see-you know, that'll cause significant job creation and, and it will-I mean, we would take 3½ percent. We didn't have a 3½ percent growth year-we didn't have a 3 percent growth year between the Global Financial Crisis and the end of the expansion. So that would be a good year. GREGG ROBB. Doesn't it seem like there's a risk of, of, you know, like stagflation-where that-you're going to go from 7 percent and down, that means the economy's really, you know, dropping in some way. We haven't seen that, right? CHAIR POWELL. Well, the economy's not, not decel-the economy is still growing, and growing at a, at a very healthy rate. Our estimate-I mean, different people have different estimates-but, broadly speaking, economists think the economy has the potential to grow at around 2 percent per year. If you're growing above that, then the unemployment rate should be declining, people should be being pulled into the labor force, wages should be going up, lots of things should be happening, businesses should be investing. So, you know, I guess to answer your question a different way, is there a risk that inflation will be higher than we think? Yes. As I said earlier, you know, we, we don't have any certainty about the timing or the extent of these effects from reopening. And therefore we don't-we don't think that-we think it's unlikely that they would materially affect the underlying inflation dynamics that the economy has had for a quarter of a century. The underlying forces around the globe that have created those dynamics are intact, and those are aging population, low productivity, globalization, all of those things that, that we think have, have, you know, really held down inflation. All that's out there still. You know, when we get through this, we may well-we'll be facing those same forces. Nonetheless, is there a risk that inflation will remain higher than we-than we thought? Yes. And if, if we see inflation moving above our goals in, in a time-sorry, to an extent, to a level or, or persistently-or persistently enough, you know, we would be prepared to use our tools to address that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Going to Brian Cheung with Yahoo. BRIAN CHEUNG. Chair Powell, Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. On that point, you talked about maybe some of the more structural changes in that last answer with regards to productivity. I noted that the median projection for r*, the longer-term interest rate, is still the same at 2.5 percent. But there's been some literature out there that maybe the COVID crisis could have actually changed some of the underlying fundamentals of the economy and maybe changed productivity, in addition to combined with demographic changes that have already been in effect to suggest that that longer-term neutral rate or r* might be higher. What would the implications of that be for monetary policy? Do you think that maybe the Fed could have the possibility of underestimating the long-run neutral rate? And what might be the impact of that? CHAIR POWELL. A higher neutral rate would mean that interest rates would run higher by that amount. And, and that would be a good thing from the standpoint of the economy, because it would give the Fed more room to cut rates. The problem with, with interest rates being close to the lower bound, of course, is that it really cuts into our ability to react to a downturn-for example, a pandemic. And if you look, for example, at the European Central Bank, their, their policy rate was well below zero when, when the pandemic hit. So we don't want to be in a place where we can't react. A higher neutral rate would, would be-from that narrow standpoint, would be a good thing for us. It would give us more room and, therefore, then, that would tend to result in better outcomes for the economy over time. You know, we, it's-you can't estimate it with great-with great precision. I think we would be alert to-I mean, studying r* is a-is a whole industry unto itself. And I, I think we would be alert to factors that might raise r*, the neutral rate of interest. And, you know, we, we try to keep up with that. And I think we're, we're, we're all thinking about that and the possibility of that. You know, there are many-there are a lot of stories right now that could-that essentially could lead to higher productivity growth and higher r*. We don't know which of those stories will come true. But, I mean, I'll give you an example. It's just there are-there are a lot of start-ups, a lot of early-stage companies. And is that going to have that effect? We don't know. But we'll be watching those things carefully. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. For the last question, we'll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, of course you'll be shocked to learn that you have some critics on Wall Street. And I would like to paraphrase a couple of their criticisms and get your reaction to them. One is that the new policy framework is that you react to actual data and do not react to forecasts, yet the actual inflation data is coming in hot and you're relying on the forecast that it will cool down in order to make policy. I wanted to get your view on how you square that. Another is that you have a long runway, you've said, for tapering with announcements. But if the data keep coming in faster than expected, are you trapped by fear of a taper tantrum from advancing the time period in which you announce a taper? And, finally, you've said the Fed knows how to combat inflation, but raising rates also slows the economy. And there's a concern that you might be sacrificing the economy if you wait too long and have to raise rates too quickly. CHAIR POWELL. So that's a-that's a few questions there. So let me say, first, I think people misinterpret the framework. I think the-there's nothing wrong with the framework, and there's nothing in the framework that would in any way, you know, interfere with our ability to pursue our, our goals. That's for starters. All of our discussions and all of our thinking and planning are taking place in the context of our new framework. We're strongly committed to it, we think it's well suited to our goals, including in this-in this unique time. And I think if you look at the-look at the forecasts that we've written down, you know, our Committee is solidly behind them. The forecasts are all consistent with that. You know, your specific question, I guess, was, will we be behind the curve? And, you know, that's, that's not the situation we're facing at all. The situation that we, we addressed in our-in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was a situation in which employment was at very high levels, but inflation was low. And what we said was, we wouldn't raise interest rates just because unemployment was low and employment was high if there was no evidence of inflation or other troubling imbalances. So that's what we said. That is not at all the current situation. In the current situation, we have many millions of people who are unemployed, and we have inflation running well above our target. The question we face with this inflation has nothing to do with our framework. It's a very different, very difficult version of a standard investment-sorry, a central banking question. And that is, how do you separate in inflation-how do you separate things that, that follow from broad upward price pressures from things that really are a function of, of sort of idiosyncratic factors in a particular-due to particular things? I mean, a classic example was, to pick a narrow example, was the cellphone price war back in 2017. If you remember, there was-prices were incredibly low, and it held down core PCE by three-tenths or something for a year, and then it fell out. So this is much bigger than that. And, of course, it's not-it's not easy to tell in real time which is which, but that's, that's the question you would face under, really, any framework. And, you know, we're trying to sort that out. I've tried to, to explain that today about how we think about that. And, you know, we do think that these are temporary factors, and that they'll wane. We can't be absolutely certain about the timing of that, and we're prepared to use our tools as appropriate. Your second one was? Oh, you know, we will-we will taper when we feel that the economy has achieved substantial further progress. And we will communicate very carefully in advance on that. And that's what we're doing. That's what we're going to do, and, and we will follow through on that. There's no-I mean, we will do what we can to avoid a market reaction. But, ultimately, when we achieve our macroeconomic goal, we will-we will taper as appropriate. The third thing was-what was the third thing? MICHAEL MCKEE. If you raise rates to control inflation, you also slow the economy. And the history of the Fed is that sometimes you go too far. CHAIR POWELL. That's right. And we-look, we have to balance the two-the two goals: maximum employment and price stability. Often they are-they do pull in the same direction, of course. But when we-when we raise interest rates to control inflation, there's no question that has an effect on activity. And that's the channel-one of the channels through which we get to inflation. We don't think that we're in a situation like that right now. We think that the economy is recovering from a deep hole-an unusual hole, actually, because it's to do with, with shutting down the economy. It turns out it's a heck of a lot easier to create demand than it is to, you know, to bring supply back up to snuff. That's happening all over the world. There's no reason to think that that process will last indefinitely. But we're going, you know, we're going to watch carefully to make sure that, that evolving inflation and our understanding of what's happening is, is, is right. And in the meantime, we'll conduct policy appropriately. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Steve Liesman with CNBC. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if you might be able to put some, I don't know, numbers or maybe more detail around this concept of ""substantial further progress."" What counts as the progress numerically, if you will, or, or, or citing data, if you could, that you cited in the statement today? And if you could be more specific about what substantial further progress would look like and if that would then lead you to an announcement of an actual reduction in the purchases of your assets. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Great. Thank you. So more detail on substantial further progress. So let's talk about the maximum-employment part of that. As you know, with maximum employment-unlike with, with price stability, where we can target a number of 2 percent on average-with maximum employment, there isn't a single number that we can target. That the-we monitor a broad range of, of, of data about different aspects of the labor market. There's unemployment, unemployment among different, different age groups, and such. There's participation. There's wages. There's all kinds of flow data. And we look at all of it to try to arrive at a picture of what-of what is maximum employment. So there isn't-I can't give you a, a, a set of numbers-for example, a numerical threshold like we used for a time back in 2012, I guess it was. We didn't do that here. What we said was substantial further progress toward our goals. And what we said was, we would keep, effectively, we'd-we would give advance warning as we-and, and, you know, more and more clarity-as, as we move forward. And that's what we're going to try to do. So what would substantial further progress be? I'd say we have some ground to cover on, on the labor market side. I think we're, we're some way away from, from having had substantial further progress with, with max-toward the maximum-employment goal. I would want to see some strong job numbers. And, and that's, that's kind of the idea. STEVE LIESMAN. If, if I could follow up, you talked about one side of the equation. You didn't-does it mean you feel like you've reached your goal when it comes to the inflation side? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So inflation is running well above our 2 percent objective and has been for a few months and is expected to run up certainly above our objective for a few months before we believe it'll, it'll move back down toward our objective. The question whether we've met that objective formally is really one for the Committee to make. I can't-I can't do that by myself. But it's clear that, at this time, inflation is actually running above 2 percent. And, and, again, has been and will be, at least we expect it will, in coming months before returning down toward our target. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Ann Saphir with Reuters. ANN SAPHIR. Hello. Can you hear me? [No response] Hello. Can you hear me? I'm sorry. CHAIR POWELL. Yes, yes. We can hear you. ANN SAPHIR. I apologize. I-just to follow up on the question, I want to ask, you know, is it-is it correct to see this as the, the start of the advance notice process, you know, before a taper? And, and, and also, can you speak to how the recent surge in COVID factors into your thinking on, on the taper? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So, as you know, we're, we're in a process now where what we said is that as-at this meeting and in coming meetings, we're going to be continuing to assess the economy's progress toward our goals and give advance notice. We'll be-try to provide additional clarity about our thinking, both in the-in the postmeeting statement and in the minutes and in the public comments that people make. You know, our, our approach here has been to be as transparent as we can. We have not reached substantial further progress yet. So we're, we're not there, and we see our ways as having some-we see ourselves as having some ground to cover to get there. So that's what I would say. In terms of-in terms of, of COVID and the Delta strain, I'll say a couple things. Of course, it will have significant health consequences for many. And we need to keep that in mind before we start-before we mention and move to the economic questions. This is a-rising cases in, in a number of parts of the country, and some forecasts are for them to rise quite significantly. We'll see. What we've seen, though, is with successive waves of, of COVID over the past year and some months now, there has tended to be less economic-less in the way of economic implications from each wave. And we will see whether that is the case with the Delta variety. But it's, you know, it's a-it's certainly a-not an unreasonable expectation. So it, it certainly is plausible if people would pull back from some activities because of the risk of infection. Dining out, traveling, schools might-some schools might not reopen. We may just-we may see economic effects from some of that, or it might weigh on, on the return to the labor market. Some people might choose-again, we, we don't have a strong sense of how that might work out, so we'll just be monitoring it-monitoring it carefully. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. NICK TIMIRAOS. Hi, Chair Powell. Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. In your opening statements in March and April, you noted that a transitory rise in inflation above 2 percent this year would not meet the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time, and I noticed you didn't repeat that qualification last month or today. And, and so, in your view, has the rise in inflation this year met the threshold of moderately exceeding 2 percent for some time? CHAIR POWELL. That, that would, again, be a question for the Committee. But I would really say, the guidance that you're talking about is really the guidance to do with liftoff, right? That's-what the guidance is for liftoff, we had to have labor market conditions consistent with full employment, inflation at 2 percent and on track to run-to run moderately above 2 percent for some time. It really isn't relevant now. It-because we're really-we're looking at, at tapering asset purchases. We're clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates. It's not something that, that is on our radar screen right now. You know, so when we get to that question, when we start to get to the question of, of liftoff, which, which we are not at all at now or near now, that's when we'll ask that question. That is when that, that will become a real question for us. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Jeanna Smialek at the New York Times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about [inaudible] reacting [inaudible]. You know, does that affect, affect how you're thinking about tapering? Does it affect how you're thinking about, you know, potential liftoff down the road? And if you could, just talk a little bit about that. CHAIR POWELL. Jeanna, I'm sorry. For the first 15 seconds of your question, you froze. Could you-could you say that again? I apologize. JEANNA SMIALEK. Oh, yes. No. Sorry. Yes. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the divergence in global growth and the sort of multispeed recovery we're seeing around the world impacts how the Fed thinks about its policies. So do you take into account that sort of multispeed recovery when you're thinking about tapering QE, and do you take, take it into account when you're thinking about liftoff? CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So it's an-it's an important feature of this recovery is how uneven it is. And, in many cases, that's related to the fact that some countries have had little in the way of access to, to vaccines. And so they're seeing significant outbreaks, and it's weighing on economic activity, whereas other countries-such as the United States, in particular-are having a very strong rebound. And, and now Europe is having a stronger rebound as well. So it's a feature of our economy. Now, how does it affect our policy? In, in a couple of ways, potentially. One just is that, in general, economies-and through financial markets and through trade-are, are deeply interconnected now. And so a stronger global economy will lead to more U.S. exports. And, and, you know, that'll help economic activity. To the extent the global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it'll-we'll wind up, you know, we'll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot of exports. That's one way. Another way, though, is more on the risk side. And that is, as long as COVID is running loose out there, as long as there's time and space for the development of new strains, no one's really finally safe. These, these strains-there's no reason they just can't keep coming and one, you know, one more powerful than the next. We don't know that. But that's, that's, that's certainly a plausible outcome. Now, as, as vaccinations rise, we can nonetheless get back to our economic activity. But, you know, it, it is both the right thing to do and, and very much in our interest to make sure that vaccination happens broadly around the world, just for that reason. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. James at the FT. JAMES POLITI. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, how would you describe the risks to the outlook on inflation at the moment after the last data came out higher than expected? Do you believe the risks are, you know, tilted to the upside? And does the Committee share that view? Or are they in balance? Are you still worried that there could be a hit to demand from, from the Delta variant that could tilt them sort of to the downside again? If you could give us a sense of that, that would be very helpful. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. I'd be glad to. So if you look, again, if you look at the, the most recent inflation report, what you see is that it came in significantly higher than expected. But essentially all of the overshoot can be tied to a handful of categories. It isn't the kind of inflation that's spread broadly across the economy. It's new, used, and rental cars. It's airplane tickets. It's hotels. And it's a couple of other things. And each of those has a story attached to it that is-that is really about the reopening of the economy. So we look at that, and we think that those are temporary things because the, the supply side will respond. The economy will adapt. We have a very adaptive, adaptable, flexible economy and labor market. And it's a real-a real asset that we have. And so we think that inflation should move down over time. Now, we don't have any-much confidence, let's say, in the timing of that or the size of the effects in the near term. I would say, in the near term, that the, the, the risks to inflation are probably to the upside. I, I, I have some confidence in the-in the medium term, that inflation will move back down. Again, it's hard to say when that will be. I, I, I will say, though, that, you know, we-inflation is half of our mandate. Price stability is half of our mandate. And if we were to see inflation moving up to levels persistently that were-that were above, significantly, materially above our goal and particularly if inflation expectations were to move up, we would use our tools to guide inflation back down to 2 percent. So we won't have an extended period of, of high inflation. We think that, that some of it will, will fall away naturally as the process of reopening the economy moves through. And it could take some time. In any case, we will use our tools over time as appropriate to make sure that we do have inflation that averages 2 percent over time. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Victoria at Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Mr. Chairman. So bond market pricing seems to suggest that investors think the Fed might eventually overtighten. So my question is, do you think that markets have bought into the central bank's new framework? And how do you balance that with managing inflation concerns? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so in terms of what's been happening in bond markets, I don't think there's a real consensus on, on what explains the moves between the last meeting and this meeting. We've seen the long-term yields go down significantly. Some of it is a fall in real yields, which may have been connected to-some speculate-connected to sentiment around the, the spread of the Delta variant and concern about growth. There was also some decline in inflation compensation, which has significantly reversed. And there, there are also so-called technical factors, which is where you put things that you can't quite explain. So I, I, I don't see in any of that that there is really anything that challenges the credibility of our framework, if, if that's really your question. We are committed to achieving 2 percent average inflation over time. What we said was that, in particular, when we see a very strong labor market, high levels of employment, low levels of unemployment, that won't be enough for us to raise interest rates until we see some inflation. Of course, what we have today is kind of the opposite. We've got, you know, 7 or 8 million people, fewer people, at work than were at work before the pandemic. So we're, you know, we're, we're a ways away from full maximum employment. But we have high inflation, so it's kind of the opposite case. And we have to-we have to deal with that. Any central bank has to deal with that by looking at the inflation and asking whether it is broad based and likely to be persistent and, and, and whether inflation expectations are implicated in a way that, that could cause them to rise. So we're monitoring that very carefully, and we're prepared to use our tools as appropriate. But, again, I think our-I think our framework is pretty well understood. And, and I think the real test of it will be down the road when it's time to think about raising interest rates and, and how we assess, assess that set of issues. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Rich at Bloomberg. RICH MILLER. Thanks very much, Michelle. Chairman Powell, you, you just alluded to the fact that you're prepared to use your tools to slow the economy down if need be to-if inflation looks like it's getting out of control. I want to just try to understand that in the context of the framework and the forward guidance. Does that mean you'd be prepared to raise interest rates even if we're not at maximum employment at that point, should you see this danger of inflation? And, and, two, does it also mean you'd be prepared to raise interest rates even if you are still buying assets? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So there's a-there's a part in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and, and Monetary Policy Strategy, which, Rich, I'm sure-I'm sure you're familiar with, which, which talks about that case in which the two goals are in tension. Most of the time, if you have high inflation, you also have high employment-they, they tend to go together. This is a situation where they're temporarily in different directions. We're not at full employment, but we are having high inflation. We feel like we're going to be making good progress over the next-over the course of the next year, couple of years, really, toward maximum employment. This is a very strong labor market. If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it's-we're, we're clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum. That, that's, that's the path that we're on, and, and it shouldn't take that long in macroeconomic time to get there. So that's, that's what I think is, is really the likely case. And, again, it's not-it's not timely for us to be thinking about, about raising interest rates right now. What we're doing is, we're, we're looking at our asset purchases and judging what is right for the economy and judging how we-how close we are to substantial further progress and then-and then tapering after that. The question you asked about, would we raise rates if we hadn't finished cutting-hadn't finished the taper, hypothetical question. You know, we'd, we'd face the circumstance at the time. We could always just-you know, one thing one could do would be to just cut asset purchases all the way to zero if you wanted to do that. But it's, it's, it's just hard to-it's hard to answer what you would do without knowing a lot more about the situation. Ideally, you wouldn't be still buying assets and raising rates because, of course, you're adding accommodation by buying and, and removing accommodation by raising rates. So that wouldn't be ideal. I'll say that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business. EDWARD LAWRENCE. So thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. Now, so you're talking about jobs. You just said we're on a path to a very strong job market. You know, we have 9.5 million people unemployed as of the last labor market survey and 9.2 million job openings. So what's the-what's the disconnect? Is it a skills gap? Is it the extended unemployment benefits? Is it the fact that people just aren't willing to relocate? What is the disconnect there? CHAIR POWELL. It's a-it's a really unusual situation to have-to have the ratio of vacancies to unemployed be this high. And we think there are a number of things at work there. Maybe the place to start is, is just to say that this is now not so much about people going back to their old jobs. It's about finding a new job. So that's a time-intensive, labor-intensive process. And there may be a bit of a speed limit on that. There, there's research that suggests that there is a speed limit on that. So it's not like you can have millions of people at the beginning of the recovery going back in a single month because they're just going back to their old job. This is about job selection, things like that. There may also be some factors that are-that are holding people back, and that's-this is what surveys say. There are people who, who are reluctant to go back to work because they still feel exposed to COVID. These could be jobs where, where there was a lot of, of interaction with the public and where perhaps there's a family member who's vulnerable or for whatever reason. There's also caretakers who are-where, where schools are not fully open and parents are at home or taking care of, of, of older people. And there's also been very generous unemployment benefits, which are now rolling off. They'll be-they'll be fully rolled off in a couple of months. And all of those factors should, should wane. And, you know, we, we think we should see, because of that, we should see strong job creation moving forward. I mean, ultimately, it's unusual to see aspects like the job openings number in a context where there are that many unemployed people. That many job openings would typically suggest a tight labor market. And, of course, we hear from businesses all over the country that it's very hard to hire people. And that may be because people, people are shopping carefully for their next job. I mean, I, I, I think the bottom line on this is, people want to work. If you look at where labor force participation can get, people will go back to work unless they retire. Some people will retire. But, generally speaking, Americans want to work, and, and they'll find their way into the jobs that they want. It may take some time, though. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. I wanted to follow up on what you said about there tending to be less in the way of economic implications from each wave of COVID cases. Could you elaborate on what you've seen to that end during previous waves? And then, looking forward, how vulnerable is the labor market to the Delta variant? I'm thinking or wondering if you have concerns that jobs that may have come back in travel or tourism could be susceptible if people started reconsidering their travel plans or if caretakers were suddenly faced with the prospect of schools not reopening. How do you see some of those risks going forward? Thank you so much. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So if you remember the, the summer wave last year of COVID, which was largely southern and western states, the economy just performed much better than anyone expected. You know, we, we were coming off the spring wave, where there were a lot of shutdowns. And then this big second wave hit, and I think the natural thing to do is to expect that, that it would have a real impact on the economy. And it was much less than, than people thought. People-what's happened is, first of all, many people are vaccinated. They're going on with their lives. Secondly, we've kind of learned to live with it. A lot of industries have, have kind of improvised their way around it-particularly, for example, buying a new home. That, that process of buying a new home very quickly moved to much more of a virtual process. And so they were able to, you know, to, to do that. And other industries as well have gone to take-out and, you know, no-contact things. It's-so that can all-it seems like we've learned to, to handle this. Now, I think people would like to get back to, to, you know, the way things were. And I, I, I hope to some extent, we will over time. You know, of course, the big wave we had last winter did have significant employment effects, particularly in, you know, hospitality and leisure and other entertainment-other, other areas with a lot of direct contact. A lot of jobs were lost then because that was a very strong wave that happened in, in, in the winter months last year, just before the vaccines arrived. So with Delta, we're just going to have to watch. Again, with, with, with a reasonably high percentage of the country vaccinated and the vaccine apparently being effective-we're not experts on this-but it, it seems like the-a good-a good going-in estimate would be that the effects will probably be less. There probably won't be significant lockdowns and things like that. But, again, those, those are not decisions for us or, or, or-nor is it something we're be-we'd be expert in. In terms of the, the, the channels, you know, I-this is-this is kind of speculation, but it's pretty-it just is that people, you could imagine school districts deciding to wait a month or two for the-for the-for the Delta wave to go. I'm not saying this'll happen, but that it's easy to imagine that. It's also easy to imagine that some people might say, you know what? I'm just going to-I'm just going to wait a couple of months before going back to work. Wouldn't be hard to imagine that happening. If, if schools don't open, then caretakers have to stay home. And if people don't go back into the labor force, then the job growth won't be as strong, those kinds of things. So I don't-it doesn't-it doesn't-again, sitting here today, not being able to really know the future-it doesn't seem as though the effects will be very large. But there may be effects. And they-it may be that the effect is to slow the economy down just for a period of months-or not. There are many parts of the country where it might not have an effect, and we're just going to have to, to see what the economic effects are. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to David Gura at NPR. DAVID GURA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to ask if you've started drafting your Jackson Hole speech, but I'm going to go in a-in a different direction here. Steve Liesman asked you about semantics. I'm going to take a cue from him and ask you about the term ""transitory,"" because I think of you as somebody who's so lucidly explained policies and programs in recent months and made a real concerted effort to explain them to, to the American public as a whole. I wonder about this term and what you would say to people who don't know it definitionally, don't know what it means, and see prices going up and wonder how long they're going to have to wait. So just some broader definition from you-I'd like to hear just about what it means or how you understand it. And, and quickly as well, you've talked about vaccines a bit. And your colleague in Minneapolis has placed a mandate on vaccinating employees coming back to that Federal Reserve Bank. And I wonder if that's something that you would like to see or expect to see Systemwide going forward. CHAIR POWELL. The concept of ""transitory"" is really this: It is that the increases will happen. We're not saying they will reverse. That's not what ""transitory"" means. It means that the increases in prices will happen, so there will be inflation but that the process of inflation will stop so that-so that there won't be further-when, when we think of inflation, we really think of inflation going up year upon year upon year upon year. That's inflation. When you have inflation for 12 months or whatever it might be-I'm just taking an example; I'm not making an estimate-then, then you have a price increase, but you don't have an inflation process. And so part of that just is that, if it doesn't affect longer-term inflation expectations, then it's very likely not to infect-to affect the process of inflation going forward. So what, what I mean by ""transitory"" is just something that doesn't leave a permanent mark on the inflation process. Again, we don't mean-I don't mean that, that, that, that, you know, producers are going to take those price increases back. That's, that's not the idea. It's just that they won't go on indefinitely. So to the extent people are, are, are implementing price increases because raw materials are going up or labor costs or something's going up, you know, the question, really, for inflation really is, does that mean they're going to go up the next year by the same amount? So you're going to be in a process where inflation, the inflation process, gets going. And, and that happens because people's expectations about future inflation move up. And we don't think that's happening. There's no evidence that it's happening. All the evidence is that it's not happening. But, nonetheless, we have to watch this very carefully because this is-you know, we have two mandates: maximum employment and price stability. Price stability, for us, means inflation averaging 2 percent over time. And so we've got to be very careful about that. But, but I, I, I think it's a good point that it's, it's a term-what it really means is temporary. But then you've got to understand that it doesn't mean that the-that the increases will be taken back. Some of them will be, but, but that's not really what it means. In terms of-so we're, we're working virtually here, and we'll be coming back down the road in a couple of months, starting to bring people back here at the Board of Governors in Washington. And, you know, we're going to follow public health guidance and things like that. We really haven't made the fundamental decisions about exactly what that will look like. And it'll depend on, to some extent, on what-on what, you know, CDC guidance looks like when we actually do bring people back in. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Michael McKee at Bloomberg TV. MICHAEL MCKEE. Chairman, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your taper timeline in the sense that you said you want a couple more months of data. And the statement says that the Fed is going to use-to, to evaluate the developments in the two markets, in jobs and inflation, in coming meetings. Does that suggest that we wouldn't see anything before September or November in your meetings? And I know a lot of people on Wall Street have basically felt you're going to lay out your taper plans at Jackson Hole. Is that-is that the plan, or are we not going to see anything until the fall? CHAIR POWELL. So in any decisions about the timing, and I did not-if I-if I said we're looking at wanting a couple more months of data, I wasn't-I'm not meaning to suggest anything about a particular time at which we might taper, because we really have not made that decision. All I'm saying is, is, we're not at substantial further progress. There's a range of views on, on what timing will be appropriate. And those views ultimately track, track back to people's views about the economy and, and what will happen as we make progress towards, towards our-towards our goal. So that's, that's really what it is. And I, I-we will, of course, as we-you know, we're going to continue to try to provide clarity as appropriate on, on timing, pace, and composition. But, today, I've, I've given you what I can give you because, again, this, this was the first, really, I would say, deep dive on the issues of timing, pace, and composition. And it was a good meeting. And-but no decisions are made, and, and I'm just not in a position to, to give you much guidance, really any guidance, on the actual timing. I-but I will say we're making progress. We expect further progress. And we expect that, if, if things go well, then we will-we will reach that goal. And when we reach it and the Committee is comfortable that we have reached it, then, then we'll taper at that point. I can't, I really-there's nothing I can say about Jackson Hole. You know, I'm in-we're in the process of writing that speech. And I am going to give a speech, and-but I, I, I wouldn't want to-I wouldn't want to say what will be in there at this point. MICHAEL MCKEE. Well, if I could follow up, several people have recently noted that the Fed has got the markets working well. And you've got bank loans up. In other words, you've stimulated demand. But savers and companies, like insurance companies and pension funds, are getting hammered by the low rates. And they're wondering if the balance hasn't started to shift away from benefiting the economy to doing more harm than good. CHAIR POWELL. We-asset purchases were just a key part of our response to the critical phase of the crisis. They, they really helped us restore market function to these key markets, really, on which-on which, which are very, very important to our economy and the global economy. And then they were a big part of, of creating accommodative financial conditions to support demand. They were strongly needed. It was that commitment to continue asset purchases that provided strong support for the economy and, and has been a part of the story for why the economy is so strong right now. So we said we would taper when we-when we achieve substantial further progress. And, and, you know, we're going to honor that commitment. I mean, it's-and, and, again, we're talking about it right now and meeting by meeting and, and moving in that direction. We will taper when we reach that goal. And we'll provide more, you know, more clarity on that as we go, as is appropriate. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. HANNAH LANG. Hi. You've been asked a lot previously if the Fed's monetary policy at all contributes to inequality, but I was really curious to know where you think the Fed's regulatory policy lands, particularly if you think that the Fed's bank capital requirements have had the effect of penalizing lower-income households seeking loans. Basically, is it possible to achieve the balance of a safe banking system with one that also provides equitable loan access? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think strong capital requirements are essential for banks, particularly for the largest banks. And I think that an undercapitalized banking system, as we've seen, can be a real threat to the economy and most-mostly, or to, to the greatest extent, to people at the lower end of the income spectrum. So if you look back at not this previous-not this crisis but the previous one, the bank-the banking system was undercapitalized. So higher capital requirements are, are, you know, are, are really a good thing because they allow banks to weather downturns and continue to perform the functions that they perform. I think it's other tools that we have to-and the Fed has some of these tools, Congress has some of these tools, other agencies have some of these tools-to assure or support the wide availability of credit, particularly to low- and moderate-income communities. So that's CRA. We enforce CRA. We're working on a-on a new CRA proposal right now with the other banking agencies, and we think it's going to be-it's going to be good and will support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income households. It's also the anti-anti-lending discrimination statutes that we enforce. And it's some of the programs that Congress has in place to support the flow of credit to low- and moderate-income communities. I, I don't think it's capital standards at all. I think capital standards work the other way. Strong capital is what enables banks to continue to serve their communities, including low- and moderate-income communities. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Chris Rugaber at the AP. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Chair Powell, I guess I wanted to ask about the last-when you were before Congress earlier this month, you mentioned, I think, something along the lines of, it won't take too long before we see if you're right about inflation and its temporary aspect. You also mentioned learning a lot more in the next six months about the economy. Can you tell us a little more of what you mean by that? When do you think you'll get a clean reading on inflation that is free of most of the distortions that we're seeing now? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So with inflation, as I mentioned, we're, we look not just at the headline number, but we look at all the components that go into the calculation of inflation. And if you do that, if you look under the hood, what you see is not that, widely, across the whole range of goods and services that, that are in the economy, we're seeing upward, upward pressure on prices. That's not really what we're seeing. What we're seeing is a handful of things that are really-that really account for the, the overshoot of inflation. And, as I mentioned, it's things like cars. You know, new, used, and rental cars have moved up in price because of the car shortage because of the semiconductor shortage. And housing-sorry, hotels and air, air fares have moved back up, but that really just is retracing the very large downward movement in prices that they had before. So that's, that's a big, big part of, of why the inflation readings are so high. And those don't-those, frankly, don't carry significant implications in the long run for the-for inflation or for the American economy. So what I said was, we, we're going to see whether these things-we don't need to see everything do what lumber prices have done. So if you look at lumber prices, they went up and then they went down. So what we want to see is these other things. Do they-do they-do the prices flatten out? Do they actually move down? If they flatten out, then their, their contribution to inflation becomes zero over time so that they're not contributing to inflation. And so, if we start to see those things happen fairly widely among the-among the things that have really moved up quickly, then we'll, we'll-they won't all happen at once or happen quickly-but we'll know that our basic understanding of the situation is broadly correct. And I don't think it will take, or what I said was, I don't think it'll take a very long time to see whether that's the case. It, it, it is probably the case that, frankly, the, the overall reopening of the economy is going to play out over a period of time. This is a historic, world historical event, that the global economy is now reopening. It's not going to-it's not going to happen quickly. It's going to take some time. And it's going to be very uneven, as we discussed before. But I think we will-we will know, you know, when we know. But I don't think it will take that long. I don't want to put a number on it. But I do think that, that, if we see those things happening, we'll know that we have the story basically right. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color in terms of how you're thinking about mortgage-backed securities purchases as you inch towards taper. Within the context of home prices continuing to rise, we've heard a lot of people talk about the idea that maybe they'd like to cool off on, specifically, the MBS purchases. Is that more because of the optics, or is it because there's an observed relationship from the Committee's view between MBS purchases under QE and the hot housing market? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So a number of participants raised that-the questions around MBS and tapering at, at today's meeting, as a matter of fact, and yesterday's meeting. And I'll just say that, generally speaking, I don't think and-I don't think that-I think that Treasury and MBS purchases affect financial conditions in very similar ways. There may be modest differences in terms of, of contribution to housing prices, but it's, it's not something that's big. It's not-it's-so where I think we are is, there, there really is little support for the idea of tapering MBS earlier than Treasuries. I think we will taper them at the same time. It seems likely, based on where people are now. The idea of reducing MBS purchases at a somewhat faster pace than Treasuries does have some attraction for some people-others, not so much. And I think it's something that we'll be continuing to discuss. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you very much. So I wanted to ask you about the standing repo facility and get your sense of what you think it will do for market trading conditions. And also, kind of in a similarly related point, the reverse repo numbers have just gotten even bigger since you raised the reverse repo rate at the last Fed meeting. And, you know, are you concerned to see, you know, nearly $1 trillion a day, you know, pouring in through that facility? CHAIR POWELL. So on the standing repo facility, what is it going to do? So it, it really is a backstop. So it's, it's set at 25 basis points, so out of the money, and it's, it's there to help address pressures in money market-money markets that could impede the effective implementation of monetary policy. So, really, it's, it's to support the function of-functioning of monetary policy and its, its effectiveness. That's the purpose of it. And it's set up with that purpose in mind. Your question on, on the, the [ON]RRP, so we think it's doing what it's supposed to do, what we expect of it to do, which is to help provide a floor for money market rates and help ensure that the federal funds, funds rate stays within the target range. You know, it's essentially, essentially, what's happening is that it just results in a lower aggregate amount of Federal Reserve liabilities that are in banks in the form of reserves and a higher amount of Federal Reserve liabilities in money market funds in the form of overnight RRP balances. So that, that's all that's really happening there. And we expect it to be high for some time. It's being driven, of course, by, by the relatively lower quantity of Treasury bills and, and, and also the onset of the debt ceiling and the decline in the TGA, things like that. So we don't-we don't have a problem with, with what it's doing. It's kind of doing the job we expected. MICHAEL DERBY. And you don't see any issues with, like, disaggregating, you know, markets from, you know, investing in private money market securities? You know, like, the idea that the Fed's footprint in money markets is getting too big, you don't see any issues there? CHAIR POWELL. Not, not really. Not at this point. I mean, money markets, private money market funds are, are choosing to, to invest because the rates are attractive. At some point, the rates will not be so attractive as, as the whole rate cluster normalizes, and, and you'll see it shrink back down. MICHAEL DERBY. Okay. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let's go to Greg Robb at MarketWatch. GREG ROBB. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Chair Powell, I was going to go back to inflation a little bit. I'm just kind of surprised by your tone. It, it seems like you're just sort of warning that, if inflation gets too high, you know, the Fed will act. Isn't it true that, I mean, a little inflation is good for the economy and, and that we-if somehow maybe we can get the economy out of this sort of place where we're always going to be close to the zero lower bound, isn't there a good story to tell, and you're sort of panicking people? CHAIR POWELL. I certainly don't, don't have that in mind. No. Look, we-as you know, we're targeting a moderate overshoot of 2 percent inflation for some time. We, we want inflation expectations to be centered on, on 2 percent. We feel like they may be a little bit below that. So the bigger picture is that, you know, that, that, that would be a healthy thing. This is a different thing. This is-this is not that. That was the kind of inflation we were thinking about that comes from, you know, from a very, very strong labor market and a-and a booming economy maybe. That, that was the kind of inflation-this, this is something different. This is really driven by the supply side, which is not able to hand-to handle this big spike in demand that we're seeing. As the economy reopens with vaccination and fiscal support and monetary policy support, the supply side-just all over the world, you're seeing the same thing, which is, it just can't keep up. And there are labor shortages in, in a lot of places, the same sort of thing. So, you know, there's, there's absolutely no sense of panic. I just-I've explained, I think, several times here today that the best-my, my best estimate is that this is something that will pass. It's really a shock to the economy that will pass through. And, you know, if you-if you look at where forecasters are-people who actually write down a forecast for a living-very, very strongly they see it that way. Now, we-but, you know, are-we're actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk, the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent, that it might actually move inflation expectations up, and that we might-that the kind of things that might require a response. We, again, we don't see that now. But we, we have to be on the alert for it. And people have to understand and believe that we will react if, if we need to. And we will. But, again, it's not-it's not my base case. My base case is that-is, as I've said repeatedly, is that inflation will move back down. And no, we're not-we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven't changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing. This is not moderately above 2 percent. This is well above 2 percent. But it's also not the kind of inflation we were looking for. This is really driven by a supply-side shock. GREG ROBB. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Don Lee at the Los Angeles Times for the last question. DON LEE. Hi, Chair Powell. I wonder if you could talk about wages. Many workers seem to have gotten some good wage gains in, in recent months. What can workers generally expect going forward? And it doesn't sound like you're concerned about rising wages feeding into broader inflation. Is that right? CHAIR POWELL. So wages have moved up. A lot of that is driven by new hires. And it's-a lot of it is driven at relatively low-paid jobs in the service industries as people come back. So that's not troubling. And we, we don't see-there, there is a form of wage inflation that can lead to price inflation, and we're not seeing that right now. And that really is if what we call ""unit labor costs"" move up and, and, and, which really puts-move up in a way that is-that is hard for companies to manage and puts them in a situation where they have to accept substantially lower margins or raise prices. Now, when it happens gradually, when that-if you-we've seen in a long expansion, sometimes unit labor costs do move up and, and put some pressure on margins. In a long expansion, that's been happening late in the expansion. That's not a problem, either. The problem is if it happens in a way that pushes firms broadly into raising prices. It was called the ""wage-price spiral."" We don't see that now. This is something that was a feature of the high inflationary era of the Great Inflation, but it's not a feature now. And we don't see that now. Of course, we'll be watching it. And this is one of the reasons why we're watching so carefully to see whether labor force-whether people do come back and accept jobs. Given the very large number of job openings and the very large number of unemployed people, we'd like to see, you know, those-some matching going on there so people get back to work. We think labor supply would be-would be a healthy thing. You know, but wages moving up across the spectrum, consistent with inflation and productivity, is a-is a good thing. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Chair Powell. And thank you all."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go first to Rachel Siegel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. When it comes to the taper and, eventually, to any rate increases, I'm wondering if you can walk us through what ""substantial further progress"" looks like, given the latest batch of projections that have PCE inflation coming in a little higher than the June projection, the unemployment rate also being higher than June, as well as the change to GDP lower than June. If you could help us make sense of all those things as you sort through what ""substantial further progress"" looks like, that would be great. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the test for beginning our taper is that we've achieved substantial further progress toward our goals of [2 percent] inflation and maximum employment. And for inflation, we appear to have achieved more than significant progress-substantial further progress. So that part of the test is achieved, in my view and in the view of many others. So the question is really on the maximum-employment test. So if you look at a good number of indicators, you will see that, since last December, when we articulated the test, and the readings today, in many cases more than half of the distance, for example, between the unemployment rate in December of 2020 and typical estimates of the natural rate-50 or 60 percent of that road has been traveled. So that could be substantial further progress. Many on the Committee feel that the ""substantial further progress"" test for employment has been met. Others feel that it's close, but they want to see a little more progress. There's a range of perspectives. I guess my own view would be that the test-the ""substantial further progress"" test for employment is all but met. And so, once we've met those two tests, once the Committee decides that they've met [them]-and that could come as soon as the next meeting; that's the purpose of that language, is to put notice out that that could come as soon as the next meeting. The Committee will consider that test, and we'll also look at the broader environment at that time and make a decision whether to taper. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Howard Schneider. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, Chair Powell. Thanks, Michelle. So, looking at the SEPs, we got now basically four years of inflation above target, and policy never gets to the long-run rate. I'm wondering if you could address that from two perspectives: one, within the new framework that the Fed adopted last year and, second, from the perspective of the average household that's now being asked to pay higher prices and increasingly higher prices for four years running when, for some this year, real wages have actually gone down. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So, as you can see, the inflation forecasts have moved up a bit in the outyears. And that's really, I think, a reflection of-and they've moved up significantly for this year. And that's, I think, a reflection of the fact that the bottlenecks and shortages that are being-that we're seeing in the economy have really not begun to abate in a meaningful way yet. So those seem to be going to be with us at least for a few more months and perhaps into next year. So that suggests that inflation's going to be higher this year, and a number-I guess the inflation rates for next year and 2023 were also marked up, but just by a couple of tenths. Why-those are very modest overshoots. You're looking at 2.2 and 2.1, you know, two years and three years out. These are very, very-I don't think that households are going to, you know, notice a couple of tenths of an overshoot. That just happens to be people's forecasts. You know, we want to foster a strong labor market, and we want to foster inflation averaging 2 percent over time, and I think we're very much on track to achieve those things. In terms of the framework, I see this as very consistent with the framework. We want inflation expectations to be anchored at around 2 percent. We want, we're-that's really the ultimate test of whether we're getting this done under the framework. And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent. I wouldn't put too much on a couple of tenths over 2 percent in 2023 and '24-one-tenth in '24. But you're right, those are the numbers. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Colby Smith. COLBY SMITH. Chair Powell-thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, you mentioned ongoing discussions about the tapering timeline, and I'm wondering what the contours of that debate have been. For those that want to move a bit more quickly, is it about maintaining optionality for a 2022 interest rate increase? Or is it about financial stability risks? Or concerns about the efficacy of asset purchases at a time when we have supply constraints? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So let me say that there's very broad support on the Committee for this plan, both as to the timing and as to the pace of the taper. So this was a unanimous vote today, and I'd say quite broad support for this approach. You're correct that there are some who would prefer to have gone sooner, and they've made their arguments publicly. For some of them, it's a financial stability concern. And for others, it's other concerns. They can make their own arguments. This is an approach that the Committee will broadly support, and it will put us having completed our taper sometime around the middle of next year, which seems appropriate. You know, the asset purchases, as I mentioned, were very, very important at the-in the early stages of the crisis. They were essential in restoring market function in the Treasury and other markets. Then, as the recovery got going, they supported aggregate demand, as they will do. And now we're in a situation where they still have a use, but it's time for us to begin to taper them. Their usefulness is much less as a tool than it was at the very beginning. And, of course, this leaves the whole question of rate increases ahead, which is really where the framework-the framework is all about how we deal with rate increases and that sort of thing. So we think this is the appropriate way to go. And, again, broad support on the Committee. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Nick Timiraos. NICK TIMIRAOS. Hi, Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you have said the test for liftoff is more stringent than the test for tapering. But if the near-term projections today are credible, more of your colleagues seem to think that rate liftoff, and not just a taper, may be closer at hand. Does the Committee have a different opinion than you do about the threshold for liftoff that you've articulated? Or do they believe that either inflation or economic growth will necessitate a rate increase sooner than you do? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so, again, substantial further progress toward our goals is the test for beginning the taper. And the taper takes some months in everyone's figuring. So you're going to be well away from satisfying the liftoff test when we begin the taper. So in terms of the liftoff test, though, you know, it's what we adopted last September. It's labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment. And while we have interesting signs that, in many ways, the labor market's very tight, we also have lots of slack in the labor market, and we think that those imbalances will sort themself out. Inflation at 2 percent and on track to achieve it, moderately higher inflation over 2 percent-you know, that really depends on the path of inflation. If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff. So I just think, if you look at what people are writing down for year-end 2022 numbers, some people are writing down very low unemployment rates. And that's only one indicator, but it suggests a very strong labor market. And I think they're writing down in good faith what they see as meeting the test. There's a range of perspectives about where the economy will be, but-by the way, all but one participants have us lifting off during 2023. So it's not really an unusually wide array of views about this. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. We'll go to Jeanna Smialek. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chair Powell-thank you for taking our questions. Prior to recent media reports, were you aware of the kind of security buying and selling that Presidents Kaplan and Rosengren were participating in last year? And I wonder if you thought those were appropriate. CHAIR POWELL. So, no, I was not aware of the specifics of what they were doing. So let me just say a couple things about this subject. We understand very well that the trust of the American people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission. And that's why I directed the Fed to begin a comprehensive review of the ethics rules around permissible financial holdings and activity by Fed officials. So those rules are, in many respects, the same as those for government agencies, plus a number of things that apply specifically to us because of our business. One of those is-sort of, three things I would point to in terms of specific restrictures. One is, ownership of certain assets is not allowed, and that's bank securities and other things. Secondly, there are times when we're not allowed to trade at all or to, you know, buy and sell financial assets. And that's the period immediately before and during an FOMC meeting. And, third, there's regular disclosure. So all of these-everyone's, you know, ownership and activities are all disclosed on an annual basis. So, you know, I would have had to go back and read people's financial disclosures to know what their activities have been. This has been our framework for a long time, and I guess you'd say it's served us well. The other thing you would say-that it is now clearly seen as not adequate to the task of really sustaining the public's trust in us. We need to make changes, and we're going to do that as a consequence of this. This will be a thoroughgoing and comprehensive review. We're going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards. MICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. We'll go to Steve Liesman. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on Jeanna's question, the issue of ownership of these stocks and trades. Do you think it's appropriate for Federal Reserve officials to be owning the same assets that the Federal Reserve is buying? Is that one of the modifications that you're looking at? And in that these-you said yourself, they're clearly not seen as appropriate. In that the Fed's code of conduct says Fed officials should avoid even the appearance of the, of conflict, do those trades, in fact-and holdings-violate the Fed's code of conduct? Finally, do you have a timeline as to when you might get-be done with your review? Thank you, sir. CHAIR POWELL. Don't have a timeline yet; we can start with that. So, well, let me address the muni question, since that's in there. You know, I personally owned municipal securities for many, many years, and in 2019, I froze that. Meaning I-they're no-I'm holding all those securities, my wife and I, to maturity. And munis were always thought to be a pretty safe place for a Fed person to invest because, as you know, the lore was that the Fed would never buy municipal securities. So it was not an uncommon thing. And so then comes the, you know, the COVID crisis, and I reversed that policy, and I did it without hesitating. And the reason was that the financial markets, including the municipal financial market, were very much on the verge of collapse. And it was time to go, and we did. But we also checked with the Office of Government Ethics and-who looked carefully at it and said that I didn't have a conflict. So that's one answer that I wanted to share with you. Secondly, you're right, though, as-we're going to be looking at all those things. I don't want to get ahead of the process here and speculate about particular outcomes. But this, again, comprehensive and deliberate process-we're going to make changes. I want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well, and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public's interest and the institution that we're all a part of. STEVE LIESMAN. I'm sorry, Chair Powell-I just want to follow up. You said I was right. When you said ""right,"" about that the Feds should not own-Federal Reserve officials should not own the same assets they're buying? Is that- CHAIR POWELL. I think that's a reasonable thing. Yeah, and, of course, for the most part, we don't. I mean, it was a real coincidence; I happened to pre-own these munis. They were bought many years ago, actually. And so we started buying munis as part of the Municipal Liquidity Facility. So it was really not a-it just was an unforeseen event. And I couldn't sell them, so what I did was, I just held them, checked with the ethics people, and went ahead. So, but as a general principle, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Chris Rugaber. CHRIS RUGABER. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chair Powell. Wider question about jobs and the Fed's schedule-the Fed's policy framework that you laid out here. You and other Fed officials have often talked about expecting a job market pickup in September as more children return to school, freeing up more parents to work, COVID abating. You mentioned in the past the extra unemployment benefits expiring. There's some real-time data suggesting that we may not be seeing much of a return of labor supply. So do you still expect to see that in the next couple of jobs reports? And how would a relatively weak jobs report in September affect your plans? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So, you're right, we have a-really, I'll call it a unique situation where, by many measures, the labor market is tight. And 11 million job openings, very widespread reports from employers all over the economy saying it's quite difficult to hire people, wages moving up, and that kind-so, quite a tight labor market. So our view, I think-widespread view a few months ago was that several things were coming together in the fall, including kids back to school, which would, you know, which would lighten caregiving duties, including the expiration of unemployment-extra unemployment benefits, and other things would come together to provide an increase in labor supply, and so we'd get out of this strange world where there're lots of unemployed people and a high unemployment rate but a labor shortage. And so what happened was, Delta happened. And you had this very sharp spike in Delta cases. And I think, so that affects-for example, when schools are open 60 percent of the time or when they're always at a threat of being closed because of Delta, the Delta variant, you know, you might want to wait. Rather than going ahead and taking a job and starting work only to have to quit it three weeks later, you're going to wait until you're confident of that. So some of that may not have happened. Also, people didn't, you know-as you know, hiring and spending in these face-to-face service industries, travel and leisure, it just kind of stopped during those months. So we-so that-really, the big shortfall in labor, in jobs, was largely in travel and leisure, and that's because of-clearly because of Delta. So that all happened. And so what we-we know things that didn't happen. I think there's still-it may just be that it's going to take more time. But it still seems that, inexorably, people will-these are people who were largely working back in February of 2020. They'll get back to work when it's time to do that. It just may take a longer time. You're right, though-it didn't happen with any force in September, and a lot of that was Delta. In terms of the-you asked also about the test for November. I think if the economy continues to progress broadly in line with expectations, then I think-and also the overall situation is appropriate for this, then I think we could easily move ahead at the next meeting. Or not, depending on whether we feel like that, those tests are met. CHRIS RUGABER. Well, just a quick-if I could just quickly follow up, I mean, what, how much of that will depend on what kind of jobs report we get for September? And, I mean, is it, you know, are you in a data-dependent phase here where you need to see certain numbers going ahead? Or are we at a point where you've accumulated enough progress that- CHAIR POWELL. So it is, it's accumulated progress. So, you know, for me, it wouldn't take a knockout, great, super strong employment report. It would take a reasonably good employment report for me to feel like that test is met. And others on the Committee-many on the Committee feel that the test is already met. Others want to see more progress. And, you know, we'll work it out as we go. But I would say that, in my own thinking, the test is all but met. So I don't personally need to see a very strong employment report, but I'd like to see a good-a decent employment report. I mean, it's not, it's, again, it's not to be confused with the test for liftoff, which is so much higher. CHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you. We'll go to Victoria Guida. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So I wanted to ask about the Vice Chair of Supervision position and just-I was wondering if you could speak about how you view that role and the extent to which you defer to that person on regulatory policy. And then, just sort of a related question: As you know, Randy Quarles's vice chairmanship ends next month, and I was wondering if he's going to retain the supervisory portfolio until he's replaced in that role. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So Dodd-Frank created this position, Vice Chair for Supervision, and it's, there's actually a specific assignment in the Dodd-Frank language, as I'm sure you know. And, effectively, what it means is that the Vice Chair for Supervision is charged with setting the regulatory agenda. And, you know, it's a specific grant of authority. And in the 10 years, almost, that I've been at the Fed, that person has really done that. Dan Tarullo certainly did it, and Vice Chair Quarles did it as well. And I would, I think-I respect that authority. I respect that that's the person who will set the regulatory agenda going forward, and I would accept that. And, furthermore, you know, it's fully appropriate to look at-for a new person to come in and look at the current state of regulation and supervision and suggest appropriate changes, and I welcome that. In terms of Vice Chair Quarles's term, we're not currently in that situation, and I actually don't have any updates for you on that today. We'll keep you posted on that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Steve Matthews at Bloomberg. STEVE MATTHEWS. Thank you. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about the inclusive monetary policy framework. In particular, Bloomberg surveyed economists, and we found that they predict liftoff will happen when the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.8 percent but the Black unemployment rate is 6.1 percent. And I'm wondering if a 6.1 percent unemployment rate for African Americans is consistent with full employment or whether it would need to be lower as part of your inclusive growth strategy. CHAIR POWELL. Right, so the point of the broad and inclusive goal was not to target a particular unemployment rate for any particular group. Really, we look at a broad range of-a very broad range of metrics when we think about what maximum employment is. And one of the things we look at is unemployment rates and participation rates and wages for different demographic and age groups and that kind of thing. So we will do all of that. So I think if you look back, what were we really thinking? So we all saw the benefits of a strong labor market. If you look at the last two or three years of, before the pandemic hit, you saw-after a lot of long progress, you saw a really strong labor market. And you saw wages at the low end moving up faster than everywhere else-something that's great to see. We also saw the lowest unemployment rates for minorities of various, you know, for African Americans, for example, and also participation rates. We saw a really, really healthy set of dynamics. And, by the way, we also-there was no reason why it couldn't continue. There were no imbalances in the economy, and then along came the pandemic. We were not-there was nothing in the economy that looked like a buildup of imbalances that could cause a recession. So I was very much thinking that the country would really benefit from a few more years of this. It would have been-so we're all quite eager to get back to that. We also said we wouldn't raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation. So that was another aspect of it, because we saw that that really benefited labor market participants in a broad and inclusive way. That's, of course, not the current situation. We have significant slack in the economy and inflation well above target, not moderately above target. So that's, really, how we think about it. It isn't really just targeting the headline numbers, but it's about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment. STEVE MATTHEWS. Just to follow up, should there be a significant gap between Black unemployment and overall unemployment for structural reasons that are outside of the control of the Fed that other people should be doing something about? Or should that be-should the gap be narrowed, if not down to zero? CHAIR POWELL. Well, you really-I mean, first of all, ideally, there wouldn't be any gap, of course. We would all love to see no such gap. This is a persistent gap, and it's very hard to explain based on typical metrics. It's just, it's quite troubling, but it really is-you know, we have, you know, famously broad and blunt tools. I think eliminating inequality and racial discrimination and racial disparities and that kind of thing is really something that fiscal policy and other policies-frankly, education policies and that kind of thing-are better at focusing on. I think we've identified the part that we can do, and we'll do that part. But I've always been clear that it's going to take policies broadly across society to work on these problems. STEVE MATTHEWS. Thanks. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Michael McKee. MICHAEL MCKEE. -a plan for dealing with a debt default that included prioritization, that included changes in bank regulations and possibly selling defaulted-or, nondefaulted Treasuries and buying those who are-that are. Are any or all of those still on the table? Do you think any of those would work? And what would happen to the economy, in your view, should the debt ceiling not be raised? CHAIR POWELL. So, I missed the first few words, but I think I got your question. So it's just very important that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely fashion so that the United States can pay its bills when and as they come due. That's a critically important thing. The failure to do that is something that could result in severe reactions, severe damage to the economy and to the financial markets. And it's just not something that we could contemplate, that we should contemplate. I'm not going to comment on particular tactics or things like that. I'm just going to say that I think we can all agree that the United States shouldn't default on any of its obligations-should pay them when and as due. And that, you know, no one should assume that the Fed or anyone else can protect the markets or the economy in the event of a failure-fully protect in the event of a failure to, you know, to make sure that we do pay those debts when they're due. MICHAEL MCKEE. Good. If I could follow up, have you discussed options with members of Congress? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I don't generally ever talk about the conversations I have with elected officials or other appointed officials. But, look, you can see that this is a major focus among those who have responsibility for it, and-including elected people. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Hannah Lang. HANNAH LANG. Hi-thanks so much. Senator Warren sent you a letter last week urging the Fed to break up Wells Fargo, citing what she called ""ungovernable behavior"" from the bank. I'm just curious, under what circumstances would the Fed actually consider revoking a financial holding company's license? And if the indiscretions at Wells Fargo, in your opinion, warrant such an action? CHAIR POWELL. So we're, of course, very closely monitoring Wells Fargo's efforts to fix its widespread and pervasive problems. They represent a serious matter to us, and the firm is required to remediate them. And we will take appropriate supervisory action if the firm fails to meet our expectation. We continue to hold the firm accountable for its deficiencies with an unprecedented asset cap that will stay in place until the firm has comprehensively fixed its problems. And we're not going to remove that asset cap until that's done. So bottom line is, we'll take strong supervisory action if a firm is engaging in unsafe and unsound practices or violating laws. But I can't speak to our confidential supervisory assessments of any individual bank. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Now we'll go to Michael Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you for taking my question. You noted earlier in the press conference that you weren't aware of the trading activity of the Boston and Dallas Fed Bank presidents. As you know, those, all 12 regional Fed Bank presidents just went through the renomination process earlier this year. And Governor Brainard described it as a rigorous process at the time. So I want to know, did anybody know-did anybody at the Board level know about the stock trading activity? And, going forward, do you still have confidence in the Dallas and Boston Fed Bank presidents to do their job? CHAIR POWELL. So these, I don't need to tell you, we file, people file these reports annually. And I think they were just quite recently filed for 2020. So I don't have any reason to think people at the Board would have known about particular trading that's going on. They will see that-there are people at the Fed who see the, you know, see the trading reports when they're, you know, when they're annually filed. You know, in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing, I think no one is happy, no one on the FOMC is happy to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised. It's something we take very, very seriously. This is an important moment for the Fed, and I'm determined that we will rise to the moment and handle it in ways that will stand up over time. I'm very reluctant to get ahead of the process and speculate, though, about different things. And, you know, when we have things to announce, we'll go ahead and do that, but that's really what I have for today. MICHAEL DERBY. One small follow-up. I mean, I know that you didn't have the 2020 forms in hand, but you would have had past-year forms in hand. And at least in the case of, like, the Dallas disclosure forms, similar trading activity was shown in years past. So that, in theory, could have been something that came up in the renomination process. CHAIR POWELL. So that's, yeah, that's a good question. So, you know, the five-year review that we do under this unusual provision of law where all of the Reserve Bank presidents are reviewed for reappointment at the same time every five years, that is really a broad review about their leadership of the institution, their performance on the FOMC, all of those things. And if there were a concern-a public concern or a private concern-about something that someone had done, we wouldn't wait for the five-year. We wouldn't wait that day if there were concerns. You're right, though, these-as I mentioned, we have had a framework for a long time, and it's similar to what other government agencies have, only it's a little stricter. And it is that you can trade financial instruments, but not specific ones like bank debt. You can't trade during the FOMC period and during the meeting-the blackout period and then during the meeting. And then you disclose all this, and we have disclosed it for years. So all of these things have been going-to the extent they've been going on, they've been a matter of public record. And, you know-but, nonetheless-so that-you know, it was seeming to work just okay. And now you look at it, and you see this, and you think, ""We need to do better."" And we will. But you're right, but it has not been part of the process. And, appropriately, I don't think it should have been. I mean, I wouldn't blame the people who conduct that review. I really think, if someone had raised concerns or if we'd had concerns, then it would have been, but it wouldn't have been part of that process. It would have been raised instantly, rather than once every five years. MICHAEL DERBY. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Jean Yung. JEAN YUNG. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I wanted to ask about how the Fed would balance the two parts of its dual mandate if inflation stays elevated but we still have a labor shortage and participation remains lower than ideal. Would you hold off on raising rates? Or how would you think about that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Well, let me say one thing. You're looking for conditions consistent with maximum employment to lift off, and those conditions can change over time. So you're not necessarily bound by a particular level of the unemployment rate or the participation rate or anything else like that, which can change over time. But more to your point, really, we actually have a paragraph in our framework, and something like this has been there for a long time. It's, I think it's paragraph six. And you're talking about a situation in which the two goals are not complementary; they're somehow in tension. And if we judge that's effect-that is the case, what it says is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate. So, we used to call that the balanced-approach paragraph because it had those words. So it's a very difficult situation for any central bank to be-pardon me-to be in a situation where the two goals are in tension. And that paragraph tries to address it by saying we would sort of weigh the equities between the two. How long will it take, and how big are the gaps, and that kind of thing. We don't really think we're in that-we're sort of in that situation, I'd say, in a short-term way. But we think, we do expect that this is sort of-because of the COVID shock and the reopening and all that, you're seeing this temporarily. MICHELLE SMITH. Great. Thank you. We'll go to Edward Lawrence. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. So on corporate debt, what happened with Evergrande that we've been watching, could that be-is that a preview of what could happen with the amount of corporate debt that's out there? In the past you've said you're watching the level of corporate debt. So is, what's your level of concern right now? And would you consider the Evergrande Group issue sort of a warning signal? CHAIR POWELL. About the United States, no. Corporate defaults are very low in the United States right now. Corporate leverage built up over the course of the long expansion that ended with the pandemic. We were very concerned in the last year or so. We were concerned in the last year or so, and then I'd say very concerned at the beginning of the pandemic that, if you've got a highly leveraged company and your revenue stops for an uncertain period, as things happened at the beginning of the crisis, we were very concerned that there would be a wave of defaults. It didn't happen, potentially-I mean, to a significant extent because of the CARES Act and the response that we undertook and all that. It was a, you know, a much stronger response than we've ever had. And I think for whatever reason now, you have very, very low default rates now among corporate debt. You know, the Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging market economy, really the highest that any emerging market economy has had. And the government has been working to get that under control. This is part of that effort. The government put new strictures in place for highly leveraged companies. And Evergrande is dealing with those strictures, and it's something they're managing. In terms of the implications for us, there isn't, there's not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed. But, you know, you would worry that it would affect global financial conditions through confidence channels and that kind of thing. But I wouldn't draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Brian Cheung. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Just wondering if you could give us an update on whether or not you've had conversations with the White House about a possible reappointment. And then whether or not you would like to be reappointed as this chatter kind of builds up. Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. I think the phrase goes: ""I have nothing for you on that today."" Sorry. I'm focused on doing my job- MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Greg Robb. CHAIR POWELL. -I'm focused on doing my job every day for the American people, and I don't have any comment on that, Brian. MICHELLE SMITH. Sorry about that. Let's go to Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Thanks. Thanks for taking my question, Chair Powell. I was wondering if, in your discussion about the tapering that-you said that officials think it's appropriate to end around the middle of the year-if there was any discussion about what happens to the balance sheet then. I've heard some Fed officials say that they wouldn't shrink the balance sheet. Was that discussed? And what's your stance on shrinking the balance sheet? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So my thinking on this has been: Let's get through the taper decision, and then let's turn to those issues. There are a number of related issues that-you mentioned one, Greg, but, you know, and-which you need to start to think about, and we'll do that. But I want to get, we want to get through this taper decision, and then turn to those issues, rather than start, you know, thinking about them now and having the minutes discuss them and get people thinking that we are, you know, focused on those issues, because we're really not. And, you know, we do have the experience of what we did last time. We've watched other countries and what they've done. So I think we'll be able to get to sensible decisions fairly expeditiously when it's time. But it's just not time yet, in my thinking. GREG ROBB. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Scott Horsley. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You talked a little bit about inflation expectations. And there does seem to be something of a divide between market expectations and the views of professional economists-which are pretty much in line with the FOMC members-and laypeople's expectations, at least as reflected in the recent New York Fed survey. How much weight do you put on laypeople's expectations? And what do you think accounts for that divide? CHAIR POWELL. So within-let's just take the household surveys generally. The New York Fed survey, let me talk about that specifically, and this is from the New York Fed. It's only an eight-year-old survey, and it does seem as though the, they're looking three years out. And it seems like there's a high correlation between three-year and one-year. For the most part, surveys are showing that households expect higher inflation in the near term but not in the longer term. And that's also what expectations are showing. So there are many, many different inflation measures, of course. And that's why we have this thing called the CIE, which is the, it's an index of-it's market-based measures, it's professional forecasters, and it's household surveys. And you just put them all-it's not, you know, it doesn't have a lot of grand theory about it. You put them all in, and you measure the change. So you should be-and, also, you measure things like the dispersion and that sort of thing, so you can look at all that. And, you know, it tells a story of inflation expectations moving up. Many of the different measures will also show inflation expectations moving back up to where they were in, say, 2013, which was before the really-the drop in inflation expectations broadly happened in '14 and '15-around then. So that's not a troubling thing. But, you know, inflation expectations are terribly important. We spend a lot of time watching them. And if we did see them moving up in a troubling way and running persistently above levels that are really consistent with our mandate, then, you know, we would certainly react to that. But we don't really see that now. We see more of a moderate increase that is-the first part of which is welcome. And because, you know, inflation expectations had drifted down, and it was good to see them get back up a bit. But, again, we watch carefully. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Heather Scott. HEATHER SCOTT. Hi. Sorry, you caught me off guard. Thank you, Chair Powell, for taking my question. I really appreciate it. Again, on the taper timing. You say it's going to last to the middle of next year. But with your concerns about the potential for upside risks to inflation, would you think you might need to have liftoff happen before you finish the tapering? CHAIR POWELL. That's not my expectation. Of course, we can always-we haven't decided to taper yet, and we haven't decided the pace yet. So, you know, it's not my expectation that we would have to. We can certainly speed up or slow down the taper if we-if it becomes appropriate, though. Absolutely. In fact, back in '13, when we tapered, we always said we weren't on a preset course. I think this will be a shorter period. The economy's much farther along than it was when we tapered in 2013. So it makes sense to allow the runoff to happen. It's a very gradual taper. It will be when we agree on it. And, but we certainly have the freedom to either speed it up or slow it down if that becomes appropriate. HEATHER SCOTT. But you wouldn't expect rate liftoff to happen until you're finished with that process? CHAIR POWELL. You wouldn't, no, because, you know, when you're-as long as you're buying assets, you're adding accommodation, and it wouldn't make any sense to, you know, then lift off. I mean, what you would do is, you'd speed up the taper, I think, if that were the situation you're in. Not-we don't expect to be in that situation, but I do think it would be wiser at that point to go ahead and speed up the taper, just because the two are then working in the same direction. HEATHER SCOTT. All right, thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, for the last question, we'll go to Jeff Cox. JEFF COX. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the question. I just wanted to check in with you to see if you have an update at all on the efforts from the Fed to develop a central bank digital currency. I believe that the report was supposed to come this summer, and indications that it's going to come this month. But the drumbeat seems to be kind of getting louder to see where the Fed's heading on this, and just wondering if you can provide some update there. CHAIR POWELL. Sure, I'd be glad to. So we think it's really important that the central bank maintain a stable currency and payment system for the public's benefit. That's one of our jobs. We also live in a time of transformational innovation around digital payments, and we need to make sure that the Fed is able to continue to deliver to the public a stable and trustworthy currency and payment system. So there's extensive private innovation, a lot of which is taking place outside the regulatory perimeter. And innovation is fantastic. Our economy runs on innovation. But where the public's money is concerned, we need to make sure that appropriate regulatory protections are in place, and today they really are not in some cases. So with that in mind and with the creation of myriad private currencies and currency-like products, we're working proactively to evaluate whether to issue a CBDC and, if so, in what form. We have two broad workstreams, one of which is really technology, both at the Board and in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston's work with MIT-the other of which is to identify, scope out, deal with, analyze the various public policy issues. As you mentioned, we do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement-engagement with many different groups, including elected officials, around these issues. We think it's our obligation to do the work, both on technology and public policy, to form a basis for making an informed decision. The ultimate test we'll apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovations is: Are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks? We're also, as you know, investing heavily right now in building a new settlement system for instant payments in the U.S. It'll be the first such major expansion of our core payment system since the 1970s. We found the case for this quite compelling-for consumers, businesses, and just ensuring that all financial institutions have access to that payment system. So, bottom line, we haven't made a decision about the CBDC, but we will be issuing a discussion paper soon in order to form the basis of this public interaction that we'll have. Thank you very much. JEFF COX. If I could have a quick-could I get a quick follow on that? Thank you. I was just wondering if-okay-are you concerned at all with kind of falling behind in the global race for digital currencies? CHAIR POWELL. I think it's important that we get to a place where we can make an informed decision about this and do so expeditiously. I don't think we're behind. I think it's more important to do this right than to do it fast. We are the world's reserve currency. And I think we're in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision-by the way, which will be a governmentwide decision. We would do this, we would have to have a meeting of the minds with the Administration and also probably with Congress. We would really like to have broad support for this. It's a very important innovation. And I think we would need that to go ahead, and that's the process we're engaged in. Thanks very much. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. NICK TIMIRAOS. Hi. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the markets anticipate you will raise rates once or twice next year. Are they wrong? CHAIR POWELL. So I would say it this way. We try to focus on what we can control-and that is how to communicate as clearly as possible, in this highly uncertain world, how we're thinking about the economic outlook and the balance of risks and how policy will evolve in that case and also in the cases, which are frequent, where the economy evolves in unexpected ways. So the focus at this meeting is on tapering asset purchases, not on raising rates. It is time to taper, we think, because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals, measured from last December. We don't think it's time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment, both in terms of employment and in terms of participation. Getting to your question, our baseline expectation is that supply bottlenecks and shortages will persist well into next year, and elevated inflation as well, and that, as the pandemic subsides, supply chain bottlenecks will abate-and job growth will move back up. And as that happens, inflation will decline from today's elevated levels. Of course, the timing of that is highly uncertain. But, certainly, we should see inflation moving down by the second or third quarter. The time for lifting rates and beginning to remove accommodation will depend on the path of the economy. We think we can be patient. If a response is called for, we will not hesitate. So, what I will tell you is, we will be watching carefully to see whether the economy evolves in line with our expectations, and policy will adapt appropriately. And that's what I would say. NICK TIMIRAOS. Based on-if I could follow up, based on your current outlook for the labor market, do you think it's possible-or likely, even-that maximum employment could be achieved by the second half of next year? CHAIR POWELL. So if you look at the progress that we've made over the course of the last year, if that pace were to continue, then the answer would be: ""Yes, I do think that that is possible."" Of course, we measure maximum employment based on a wide range of figures, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Next, we'll go to Jeanna at the New York Times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. I was wondering if you could detail a little bit how you're thinking about wages at this moment. Obviously, we're seeing strong wage growth, particularly for people in sort of lower-income fields. I wonder if you see that as a positive thing or as a potential start to a wage-price spiral and sort of how you sort of delineate those two things. CHAIR POWELL. So wages have been moving up strongly, very strongly. And, in particular, I would point to the employment compensation index reading that we got last Friday. Now, in real terms, they've been-they had been running a little bit below inflation, so real wages were not really increasing. I think, with the ECI reading, it becomes close to maybe not increasing, but close to back to zero in terms of the real increase. So wages moving up, of course, is how standard of living increases over the years for generation upon generation. It's very important, and it's generally a good thing. You know, the concern is a somewhat unusual case where, if wages were to be rising persistently and materially above inflation and productivity gains, that could put upward pressure on, or downward pressure on margins and cause companies to-or employers, really-to raise prices as a result, and you can see yourself, find yourself in what we used to call a wage-price spiral. We don't have evidence of that yet. Productivity has been very high. The ECI reading is just one reading. Again, if you look back, we-so we'll be watching this carefully. But I would say that, at this point, we don't see troubling increases in wages. And we don't expect those to emerge, but we'll be watching carefully. JOE PAVEL. Next, we'll go to Steve Liesman from CNBC. STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wonder if you could perhaps give us your thinking about the tradeoffs between inflation and unemployment. You talked about the shortfall of unemployment-reemployment relative to before the pandemic, and yet you have inflation, which is affecting everybody. Are we at, or close to, a point where the risk of inflation is greater than the benefit that you'd-for recovering these lost jobs so that now, from a risk-management standpoint, it makes sense to move more aggressively on rate hikes? And kind of a related question: The statement today says you'll keep policy accommodative until you hit that 2 percent inflation target. Our surveys show looking for 5 percent inflation this year, 3½ percent next year-it sure seems like you're on track to modestly or moderately exceed that 2 percent target. Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I'm not sure I totally got your first question, but I would say-in fact, could you just quickly, succinctly, say your first question again? STEVE LIESMAN. Sure. The idea that the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, that you would keep policy accommodative to put this 5 million folks, or find these 5 million jobs again, at the same time all Americans will be suffering from higher inflation-is that tradeoff worth it, or is it better or smarter to raise rates right now to combat inflation and perhaps not lean so heavily on the employment side of the mandate? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, so, you know, this isn't the traditional Phillips curve situation where there's a direct tradeoff, where that's really what we're talking about. The inflation that we're seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It's due to bottlenecks, and it's due to shortages, and it's due to very strong demand meeting those. So I think it's not the classical situation where you have that precise tradeoff. But, you know, in this situation, we do have a provision in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals, as you know, that says when those two things are in tension, what we do is, we take into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with the mandate. So we used to call that the ""balanced approach"" paragraph. We have to think about the amount of the deviation, we have to think about the time it will take, and we have to make policy in a world where the two goals are in tension. It's very difficult. But what it really boils down to is something that's common sense. And that is risk management. We have to be aware of the risks that we're-particularly now the risk of significantly higher inflation. We see shortages and bottlenecks persisting into next year, well into next year. We see higher inflation persisting, and we have to be in position to address that risk should it become really a threat to-should it create a threat of more persistent, longer-term inflation. And that's what we think our policy is doing now. It's putting us in a position to be able to address the range of plausible outcomes. JOE PAVEL. Thank you. Next, we'll go to Colby Smith at the Financial Times. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Chair Powell, what are the economic conditions that would perhaps warrant a faster pace of tapering? And I'm wondering how you would also characterize the risks that the Fed may actually need to accelerate that process eventually. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I guess, as I said in my opening remarks, assuming the economy performs broadly as expected, the Committee judges that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month, and we're prepared to deviate from that path if warranted by changes in the economic outlook. So I'm not going to give you a lot more detail on what that might be. Of course, if we do see something like that happening, if it becomes a question, then we'll communicate very transparently and openly about that. But I'm just going to leave it with the words that are in the statement. Sorry, was there a second part? COLBY SMITH. Yes. It's just on characterizing the risks that you might actually have to do so later on. CHAIR POWELL. You know, I would just leave you with the words we have here. We are prepared to speed up or slow down the pace of reductions in asset purchases if it's warranted by changes in the economic outlook. And, again, if we feel like something like that's happening, then we'll be very transparent about it. We wouldn't want to surprise markets. We'll say, in light of this factor or these factors, we are considering doing this, and then we would either do it or not do it. But so-but I'm not going to, you know, start making up examples of what that might be today. Thanks. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. JOE PAVEL. Thank you. Next one, Rachel Siegel at the Washington Post. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you so much for taking our questions. You mentioned at the beginning that the Fed understands the difficulties that high inflation poses for individuals and families, especially those with limited means. What is your message to those families or consumers that are struggling with higher prices right now, and do you feel that your expectations around transitory inflation, that message is reaching them? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, first of all, it is our job to-and we accept responsibility and accountability for inflation in the medium term. We're accountable to Congress and to the American people for maximum employment and price stability. The level of inflation we have right now is not at all consistent with price stability. By the way, we're also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned. So I would want to assure people that we will use our tools as appropriate to get inflation under control. We don't think it's a good time to raise interest rates, though, because we want to see the labor market heal further. And we have very good reason to think that that will happen as the Delta variant declines, so-which it's doing now. So ""transitory"" is a word that people have had different understandings of. For some, it carries a sense of ""short lived,"" and that's, you know, there's a real time component-measured in months, let's say. Really, for us, what ""transitory"" has meant is that if something is transitory, it will not leave behind it permanently or very persistently higher inflation. So that's why we, you know, we took a step back from ""transitory."" We said ""expected to be transitory,"" first of all, to show uncertainty around that-we've always said that, by the way, in other contexts; we just hadn't done it in the statement-but also to acknowledge, really, that it means different things to different people. And then we added some language to really explain more what we're talking about in paragraph two and paragraph three. We said that ""supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases,"" and we said, ""Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation."" So we're trying to explain what we mean and also acknowledging more uncertainty about ""transitory."" So it's, I mean, it's become a word that's attracted a lot of attention that maybe is distracting from our message, which we want to be as clear as possible. Ultimately, the only other thing I would say is, look, we understand completely that it's particularly people who are living paycheck to paycheck or seeing higher grocery costs, higher gasoline costs-when the winter comes, higher heating costs for their homes. We understand completely what they're going through. And, you know, we will use our tools over time to make sure that that doesn't become a permanent feature of life. Really, that's one of our principal jobs, along with achieving maximum employment. And that's our commitment. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Chris Rugaber of the Associated Press. CHRIS RUGABER. Great. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Chair Powell. Well, I wonder if you could update us. You talked about getting back to full employment, and so could you update how you define that? I mean, you've, you know-a few months ago, yourself and other Fed officials talked about getting back to the pre-COVID labor market. There were even hints you might try to do something better than that. Now we heard talk of, as you mentioned, people retiring, and there's talk of not being able to get back as-all the jobs back because of that and other trends. You did mention the prime-age folks. So can you give us some examples of things you're looking at, specifically, to measure full employment? Will you be looking at prime-age employment population ratio, for example, and, if so, do you need to see it get back to pre-COVID levels to achieve maximum employment, or is there something short of that that would work? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thanks. So maximum employment is, it's a broad-what would we say?-broad-based and inclusive goal that's not directly measurable and changes over time due to various factors. You can't specify a specific goal. So it's taking into account quite a broad range of things, and, of course, employment-levels of employment-[and] participation are a part of that. But, in addition, there are other measures of what's going on in the labor market, like wages is a key measure of how tight the labor market is-the level of quits, the amount of job openings, the flows in and out of various states. So we look at so many different things, and you make an overall judgment. Now, the temptation at the beginning of the recovery was to look at the data in February of 2020 and say, well, that's the goal because we didn't know any-that's what we knew. We knew that was achievable in a context of low inflation. I think we're in a, you know, we're learning that. We have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very, you know, COVID-affected, by the way. A lot of what we're seeing in the last 90 days is because of Delta. We were on a path to a very different place. Delta put us on a different path. And we see these things. But, so I think we're going to have to-ideally, we would have, we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn't another COVID spike, and then we would be able to see, I think, a lot. We would see whether-how does participation react in that world, in that sort of post-COVID world? Right now, people are staying out of the labor market because of caretaking [and] because of fear of COVID to a significant extent. You know, we thought that schools reopening and elapsing unemployment benefits would produce some sort of additional labor supply. That doesn't seem to have been the case, interestingly. So I think there's room for a whole lot of humility here, as we try to think about what maximum employment would be. We're going to have to see some time post-COVID so that we know-or post-Delta, anyway-to see what is possible. And I think the learning for those of us who lived through the last cycle is that, over time, you can get to places that didn't look possible. Now, what we also have now, though, is, we have high inflation. So we have a completely different situation now where we have high inflation, and we have to balance that with what's going on in the employment market. So it's a complicated situation, and I would say, we will, we hope to achieve significantly greater clarity about where this economy is going and what the characteristics of the post-pandemic economy are over the first half of next year. JOE PAVEL. Thanks. We'll go to Howard Schneider at Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, and thanks for doing this. So, given that answer about employment, I would like to get back to Steve's question a little bit. On a headline basis, just as it's evolved this year, do you feel that the two tests on inflation have been met? CHAIR POWELL. Sorry, the two tests? HOWARD SCHNEIDER. The two tests in the statement-the guidance that it has to hit 2 percent and be on track to moderately be above 2 percent. Has the economy cleared that? CHAIR POWELL. That's a decision for the Committee. I would put it to you this way. When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee's judgment, it's very possible that the inflation test will already be met. We're aware that that language sounds, it sounds a little out of touch with what's going on, but, you know, we're not at maximum employment. When that is the case, we'll look to see whether the inflation test is met, and there's a good chance that it will be if you look at how inflation has evolved in the last year and a half. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. So, to follow up, so you're not willing to commit that the current levels of inflation and their persistence have met ""moderately"" and ""for some time."" So, given that, I mean, how should we wonder what ""moderately"" over and ""for some time"" mean? CHAIR POWELL. What I'm really saying is, that question is not before us right now. You know, we had the question on when to taper. We've now answered that question and the speed of it and all that. We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don't meet the liftoff test now because we're not at maximum employment. What I'm saying is, given where inflation is and where it's projected to be, let's say we do meet the maximum-employment test. Then the Committee-the question for the Committee at that time will be, has the inflation test been met? And, you know, I don't want to get ahead of the Committee on that, but the answer may very well be ""Yes, it's been met."" But we're not asking that question today, because we're not running a liftoff test. We're not evaluating the liftoff test today. We didn't have that discussion at today's meeting. We did talk about the economy and the development of the economy, but we didn't ask ourselves whether the liftoff test is met, because, you know, it's clearly not met on the maximum-employment side. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Matthew Boesler at Bloomberg. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg. So, when you're looking at this question of assessing whether or not the U.S. economy is at maximum employment, do you have a framework for making that judgment that is independent of what inflation is doing? And, if not, does it kind of complicate that assessment, given all of the uncertainty about inflation right now and the inclination to believe that, you know, the high inflation we're seeing is not related to capacity utilization in the labor market? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we don't actually define maximum employment as-we define it in terms of inflation, but, of course, there is a connection there. Maximum employment has to be a level that is consistent with stable prices. But that's not really how we think about it. We think about maximum employment as looking at a broad range of things. You can't just look at-unlike inflation, where you can have a number. But with maximum employment, you could be in a situation, hypothetically, where the unemployment rate is low, but there are many people who are out of the labor force and will come back in. And so you wouldn't really be at maximum employment, because there's this group that isn't counted as unemployed. So we look at a range of things. So the thing is, by many measures, we are at a very tight labor market. I mentioned quits and job openings and wages and things. Many of them are signaling a tight labor market, but the issue is, how persistent is that? Because you have people who are held out of the labor market, you know, of their own-they're holding themselves out of the labor market because of caretaking needs or because of fear of COVID, or, for whatever reason, they're staying out. And it's clear that there are, you know-with tremendous demand for workers and wages moving up, it does seem like we're set up to go back to a higher job-creation rate. So that would suggest that you're not at maximum employment. So, at the end of the day, it is a judgment thing. But, of course, at the end of it, it also has to be a level of employment that's consistent with price stability. MATTHEW BOESLER. And if I could just follow up briefly, you know, you've talked a little bit about this possibility that the two goals might be in tension and how you would have to balance those two things. Could you talk a little bit about what the Fed's process for balancing those two goals would be in the event that, say, come next year, you decide there's a serious risk of persistent inflationary pressures despite ongoing employment shortfalls? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, again, it's a risk-management thing. It's not-I can't reduce it to an equation, but, ultimately, it's about risk management. So you want to be in a position to act, to cover the full range of plausible outcomes, not just the base case. And in this case, the risk is skewed. For now, it appears to be skewed toward higher inflation. So we need to be in a position to act in case it becomes necessary to do so or appropriate to do so, and we think we will be. So that's how we're thinking about it. And I think, though, that, judgmentally, too, it's appropriate to be patient. It's appropriate for us to see what the labor market and what the economy look like when they heal further. We know that we were on a path to a different place, as I mentioned, when Delta arrived. And Delta stopped, it stopped job creation. It stopped that transition away from a goods-focused economy where there's excess demand for goods because there-services are not available. People are not traveling. That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that. So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation. Bottlenecks should be abating. We start to see that now with some of them, but, overall, they haven't gotten better overall, and, you know, we're very aware of that. So that's really how we're thinking about it. We're thinking that time will tell us more. In the meantime, we don't think it's time to raise rates now. You know, if we do conclude that it's necessary to do so, then we'll be patient, but we won't hesitate. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Edward Lawrence at Fox Business. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for taking the call. So the Federal Reserve-I want to talk about climate change. The Federal Reserve released a statement today-says ""the Federal Reserve supports the efforts . . . to identify key issues and potential solutions for the climate-related challenges most relevant to central banks and supervisory"" outcomes. Is this putting us on the path to regulate what banks can offer loans on or invest in, like coal plants or fossil fuels? CHAIR POWELL. So that's not a decision for bank regulators or for any agency. That's a decision for elected representatives. So we feel that any role that we have-and we do think we have a role in climate change. It relates to our existing mandates, and our existing mandates are, really, prudential regulation of financial institutions. We expect them, and the public will expect us to expect them, to understand and be in a position to manage their risks. So that's physical risk, and it's transition risk for climate. And, by the way, the large financial institutions are doing this already, and, you know, we think that's right within our mandate. There's also a financial stability question, the overall stability of the financial system. And so, from that standpoint, we can do research. We can try to help understand what will the pathways be through which climate change effects the economy-both physical risk and transition risk. That's what we can do, and that's what we will do. And we'll do it well. Within the frame of our existing mandates, we'll do it well. We're not the people who will decide the national strategy on climate change. That has to be elected people, and not so much us. We feel like we have that narrow mandate, and we will do it well. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Victoria Guida at Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. So the Fed recently announced that there is going to be new conflict-of-interest rules for investments by Fed officials, and this follows, obviously, the resignation of two regional Fed presidents. And I'm just wondering, do you think that there is more that you will need to do to rebuild the credibility of the Fed, such as, you know, requiring officials to put their assets in blind trusts? And also, if you could speak to whether you have any concerns that any rules or laws were broken by Fed officials. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we, you know, we-let me just say that this system, the ethics system we had in place had been in place for decades and had, as far as we know, served us well, and then that was no longer the case. And so we had no moment of denial about that. As a group, we stepped in, and we took the actions that we took. And, you know, within one FOMC cycle, we announced a new set of rules to, you know, to try to put us back where we need to be, which is, we need to have the complete trust of the American people that we're working in their interest all the time-absolutely critical to our work, as it is for any government agency. And I feel like this called that into question. So we reacted, I would characterize it, strongly and forcefully. If there were other things that we could do that were reasonable, we would certainly do them. So you asked me about blind trusts. You know, the overall authority for ethics around these issues in the federal government is the Office of Government Ethics, OGE. And they have a long-held position which is not favorable to blind trusts. They do not encourage them. They don't think they're effective. They think they're cumbersome. And they think there are better ways to get at the things that need to be done. And those are the things that we're actually doing. So I don't know that there are any blind trusts, for that reason, because they are the, they're the regulator. They say this on their website, if you look. In terms of laws broken, you know, I asked the inspector general to look to see whether there were rules broken and whether there were laws broken, and I won't speculate on that. But that is with the inspector general now and, of course, out of my hands. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Mike McKee at Bloomberg. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, the critics of your patience policy argue that, given the long and variable lags with which monetary policy works, that you are likely to end up, given inflation, by having to raise rates faster and farther than you would have liked and, therefore, send the economy into recession. Given the fact that, basically, your forecast has been chasing inflation over the last year, and now you're talking about it not coming down until the second or third quarter, why would they be wrong in thinking that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, so, let me say what's happened-and we're very, very straightforward about it-is that inflation has come in higher than expected, and bottlenecks have been more persistent and more prevalent. We see that just like everybody else does, and we see that they're now on track to persist well into next year. That was not expected-not expected by us, not expected by other macro forecasters. Now, let me say, you know, it's difficult enough to just forecast the economy in normal times. When you're talking about, you know, global supply chains in turmoil, it's a whole different thing. And you're talking about a pandemic that's holding people out of the labor force for reasons that we can sample, but we don't have a lot of experience with this. So it's very, very difficult to forecast and not easy to set policy. So we have to set policy, though. So that's what we're doing. And, you know, so, to look at your question this way, I don't think that we're behind the curve. I actually believe that policy is well positioned to address the range of plausible outcomes, and that's what we need to do. I do think it would be premature to raise rates today. That's not-I don't think that's controversial. Certainly, I don't know anyone arguing for that today. And the reason is that there's still ground to cover to get to maximum employment. And we don't want to stop that when there's good reason to think-there's still good reason to think, although it's been delayed, clearly, there's good reason to think that the economy will reopen, particularly if we do get past, you know, significant outbreaks of COVID. That's when we're really going to see what the characteristics of the labor market are. And, you know, I think, you know, the bottlenecks that we're seeing in global supply chains around goods and, frankly, now at our own domestic ports, because demand is stronger than the capacity of those ports-those things are going to work themselves out. We have a flexible economy. It'll take some time, but, you know, it took-you know, the experts managed to create a vaccine faster than, certainly, than I expected. And I think this stuff will work itself out over the course of next year. That is my baseline understanding, and that's a very widely held one among people. But, you know, we are prepared for different eventualities, and we will use our tools to achieve price stability and maximum employment. And we're going to let the data lead us to where we need to go. Our policy will adapt-and has already adapted-to the changing understanding of inflation and of bottlenecks and the whole supply-side story-which is also partly a demand story. So our policy will continue to adapt as is appropriate. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. So you announced that the Fed is going to taper at a rate of, starting at $15 billion a month, and that's more than twice the pace of the last taper. So why are you tapering faster this time? CHAIR POWELL. The economy is in quite a different place than when we tapered back in, I guess it was, 2013. We were much farther away from maximum employment. Inflation was much lower. This is an economy where demand is very, very strong, very strong, and job openings substantially exceed the number of unemployed people. So the need for further stimulus is far less than it was in 2013, where we still had quite a ways to go. I mean, after we began that taper, it was still many years before we reached what I would characterize as conditions consistent with maximum employment, let alone price stability. So this is quite a different situation, and, you know, the Committee unanimously felt today that we had met the test that we'd articulated, and this was appropriate. And this is faster than, you know, than what people had expected six months ago. It's earlier and faster, and that's because our, as I mentioned, our policy has been adapting to the situation as it evolves, as it's clarifying itself, and that's partly because we see inflation coming in higher-so. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Mike Derby. MICHAEL DERBY. Yes, thank you for taking my question. I wonder if the Fed has given any thoughts yet to the endgame for the balance sheet in terms of, you know, once you get the taper process complete, will you hold the balance sheet steady, or will you allow it to start passively winding down? And then, in a related question, do you have any greater insight into what Fed bond buying actually does for the economy? In terms of its economic impact, have you been able to, you know, measure it or quantify it in any fashion, you know, because I'm sure you know there's often been questions about, what is bond buying actually doing to help the economy? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So in terms of the balance sheet, those questions that you mention-we haven't gone back to them. Now that we've tapered, I expect that that's exactly what we'll do in coming meetings. And we'll do it in an orderly fashion, and we'll talk about reinvestment and all those things. And we don't have to make decisions on those yet. But, you know, typically, when we're doing a new subject like that, we'll have a series of briefings and discussions. And that's what we will now begin to do. In terms of the effect of asset purchases on the economy, so, there's a tremendous amount of research and scholarship on this. And, you know, you can kind of-you can find different people coming out with different views. But I would say, the most mainstream view would be that you're at the effective lower bound, so how do you affect longer-term rates? There are two ways. One, so you can't lower rates-let's say you can't lower rates any further, hypothetically. So you can give forward guidance. You can say, we're going to keep the rates low for a period of time, either [for] a specific period, [or] until certain conditions are met. The markets will do the math, and that'll have an effect on longer-term borrowings even, you know, 10, 30 years out kind of thing. So that's one thing. The other thing you can do is, you just go buy those securities, buy longer-term securities. That will drive down longer-term rates and hold them lower, and, you know, rates right across the, right across the rate spectrum matter for borrowers. So lower rates encourage more borrowing, encourage more economic activity. People-you can service your debt. You have more free cash flow. You know, it's not different from what we do at the short end. So that was discussed long before anybody did it. That was-I think Milton Friedman said that that was what you could do if you were pinned at the lower bound, many, many years ago. So, anyway, that's how it's supposed to work. And, you know, it's quite hard to be precise about these things because, you know, you only have one economy, and you can't run two different economies right next to each other and do a scientific experiment. But most people find-most of the findings are that it does support economic activity in the way that you would expect, which is to say, at the margin, more economic activity with lower rates, which is why we do what we do. More accommodative financial conditions lead to more economic activity, over time, with a lag. So I think that's the main finding I would say on QE. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We're going to go to Paul Lamonica at CNN. PAUL LAMONICA. Chair Powell, Chair Powell, you've addressed already questions about the stock purchases that took place from some of the regional Fed presidents and, you know, addressing the American people to make sure that they can trust the Fed. I was wondering, also, in light of the fact that, you know, we now have questions about your own future, whether or not President Biden will nominate you for a second term, what would you say-to the President and to senators that, potentially, you know, will be voting on a renomination-about this, specifically with regards to your future as Fed Chair for a possible second term? CHAIR POWELL. So I'm not going to-I won't have any-I will answer your question, Paul, but I'm not going to have any comment whatsoever on the renomination process at all. PAUL LAMONICA. Fair enough. CHAIR POWELL. I will say, though, that I have briefed Administration officials, and I've briefed people on Capitol Hill in detail about what we did and why we did it, and seeking their feedback, getting their reaction. But, you know, this is-part of my job is-Congress has oversight over the Fed, and we take that very seriously. So if you're on our, one of the two committees that has oversight over us, then I'm in regular contact with you, probably. And, you know, when something like this comes up, I'm on the phone. I'm offering to meet with you and explain it to you and answer your questions and identify any concerns people might have. That's just part of my job. So I do that. I don't talk about particular conversations. But you can assume I'll always do that. And I certainly did it in this case. PAUL LAMONICA. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Hannah Lang at the American Banker. HANNAH LANG. Hi. I wanted to ask about the supplementary leverage ratio. Is the Fed still planning on taking comment on ways to permanently address that, and how concerned are you, ultimately, about banks' willingness to intermediate in the Treasury markets without a permanent fix? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't have anything for you on supplemental leverage ratio right now. We are looking at ways to, if there are ways we can address liquidity issues through that channel. We're also-we also have a-there's a working group headed by [the] Treasury about, over Treasury [securities] markets, and what happened in the acute phase of the pandemic, and what structural things may need to be done. So that would be part of that workstream, and I know that there's a lot going on. I'm not sure when that report will be out. So it's work under way. That's one of the many issues that are part of that, along with things like central clearing of Treasuries, greater central clearing, and, you know, many other ideas. It's important that we have a liquid Treasury [securities] market. It's a huge public benefit that we do, and, you know, I think we need to do those things that enable that, you know, while also assuring the safety and soundness of our largest financial institutions, who tend to be the main dealers. So we have to make sure that that's always a first order of concern as well. HANNAH LANG. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Cheung at Yahoo Finance. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Brian Cheung, Yahoo Finance. So, just to expand on the ethics conversation, you talked about how you engage with people on Capitol Hill and in the Administration. You talked about what you've done already, but I'm just wondering if you can take a step back and just assess whether or not there was reputational damage as a result of that, either from the public's view or from the financial community's view of the Federal Reserve's independence. And then, secondly, do you look back on the whole episode and have thoughts on your individual responsibility in preventing something like this from having happened? CHAIR POWELL You know, I think it's too soon to say what the reputational damage is. I think, from the very beginning, my reaction was: We need to deal with this straightforwardly, transparently, and forcefully. And that's what we're going to do. I mean, it's, it means everything to me that we do whatever it takes to make sure that nothing like this happens again, and I like to think we've made a real good start on that. If you think about it, you cannot execute a trade unless it's precleared, and then you have to say, ""Execute."" It's not even a trade. Really, there's no trading going on. This is for investment and, you know, getting liquidity for life's expenses. But you then have to wait 45 days to actually execute that sale or purchase. So I think it's a pretty good system. We'll always be looking to make it better. So in terms of our independence, you know, look, I think we will address this, and I think we have. And I like to think it's enough, but it's going to, you know-we're just beginning to implement it. We have to write the rules, which we're doing, you know, as quickly as possible. We need more people. We're going to have to resource this much more significantly here at the Board, and also, we're going to need appropriate technology, because, you know, the Fed has more than-the System has more than 30,000 employees. Not all of them, far few of them, will be covered by this, but the senior officers, who will be covered by this, will, you know, will have to have technology access, and it's going to have to work efficiently. So there's a lot of work to do to implement. You know, again, I would just say, this system has been in place for decades. And it was in place when I took over. It was in place for the last, at least the last three or four Chairs. And, you know, it was what it was. And, you know, it proved to have weaknesses in it. And part of that was, it wasn't uniformly enforced across the System. I'm a big believer in the value of the Federal Reserve System and the Reserve Banks. But you had 12 different ethics officers at 12 different Banks. And you had ethics people here. And, you know, compliance wasn't, it wasn't all exactly the same. It was a little bit different and uneven, and also, the rules were-you know, we didn't imagine the problems that happened. And they may have actually been-I don't know this-but they may actually have been in compliance with the specifics of our rules. They were clearly not in compliance with the part of our rules that said, don't do anything that would create that appearance. I mean, that's clear. This was a bad appearance. So, anyway, what can we do? We are where we are. It happened, and we just have to deal with it forthrightly and transparently and ""own"" it and step up to this, you know, meet this moment. I'm totally committed to doing that. And, again, if there are better ideas, I'd love to hear them, but I think we have so far made a good start. BRIAN CHEUNG. When you say you spoke with Administration officials, did that include the President? CHAIR POWELL. I'm not going to answer who I spoke to at all. I just, I'm not going to give you any names, so don't take that as a ""yes"" or ""no."" I'm just not going to start down that road. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Thank you. We're going to go to Jeff Cox for the last question. JEFF COX. Yes, thank you. Chair, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on employment. We've seen what's been called the great resignation, folks leaving their jobs in record numbers. Is there any feeling there that maybe you've been accused of ""fighting the last war""-that perhaps the labor dynamics have changed in the post-COVID environment and that full employment may not look like what it looked like before? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, what's happening is, people are leaving their jobs. They're quitting their jobs in all-time-high numbers-but, in many cases, going back into employment and getting higher wages. So a lot of the higher wages you're seeing are for job switchers rather than incumbents. So that's just, that's a sign of a really strong labor market, as opposed to people just running off and quitting. There have also been-there are a significant number of retirements, and we'll just have to see what that means. So, toward the end of the last cycle, which was the longest in our recorded economic history, we did see labor force participation moving up well above what economists estimate was the trend, and part of that was people staying in the labor force or just not retiring at the rates they were expected to retire. So maybe this was just catch-up on that. I am a believer that, over time, you won't know how far-you won't know what can happen with labor force participation in advance. You're just going to have to give it some time, because we saw that over and over again. There are things that we can, where we can say, you know, this is where the limit is. Labor force participation is a much more flexible subject for me, and so I do think we need to be humble about what the limits are of labor force participation. But we expect labor force participation to pick up. We don't know the pace at which it will do so. So in terms of full employment, as I discussed earlier, I think, at the very beginning of the recovery, the natural thing to do was to look back at labor conditions, labor market conditions in February of 2010, at the end of the longest expansion in our history. There was so much to like about that labor market, a really historically good labor market-never perfect, but a good labor market. We're in a different world now. This is a-it's just very different. The pandemic recession was the deepest, and the recovery has been the fastest. And wages didn't really go down. And, you know, real incomes were more than fully replaced by fiscal policy [support]. All of this is completely unusual. You know, an economy where inflation was driven by services is now inflation where-all the inflation is in goods, which have had negative inflation for a quarter-century. So you ask about full employment. I think we have to-I'm very open to the thought that it's going to be an empirical question of where it is located, and we're just going to learn more and more. I mean, one thing we'll learn, I think, I hope we'll learn in the next, in the near term is, once the Delta variant really does continue to decline, what's going to happen to employment? Are we going to start to see over the winter, you know, significant increases in jobs again? If you look back, the three-, six-, and nine-month average job creation is between 550,000 and 600,000. So if you think of that as a stronger-you don't have to think back to the million-job months of June and July. You can just think, okay, 550 to 600-if we should get back on that path, then we would be making good progress, and we like to see that, of course. So we'll know so much more. And, believe me, we understand. It's a different world in so many ways. And we're very open to that. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for joining us today. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Mr. Chair, we'll go to Rachel from the Washington Post. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you very much, Michelle. And thank you, Chair Powell, for taking our questions. The latest FOMC materials say that the FOMC thinks it will be appropriate to keep rates near zero until labor market conditions reach levels consistent with maximum employment. And there are also three rate hikes penciled in the projections for next year. In order to set up those hikes, what will maximum employment have to look like? When will you know that that threshold has been met? And how will that be communicated? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So maximum employment, if you look at our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, maximum employment is something that we look at a broad range of indicators. And those would include, of course, things like the unemployment rate, the labor force participation rate, job openings, wages, flows in and out of the labor force in various parts of the labor force. We'd also tend to look broadly and inclusively at different demographic groups and not just at the headline and aggregate numbers. So that's a-that's a judgment for the Committee to make. The Committee will make a judgment that we've achieved labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment when it makes that-it is, admittedly, a judgment call because it's a range of factors. Unlike inflation, where we have one number that sort of dominates, it's a broad range of things. So, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, in my view, we are making rapid progress toward maximum employment. And you see that, of course, in some of the factors that I mentioned. MICHELLE SMITH. Great, thank you. Steve at CNBC. STEVE LIESMAN. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is: If-It's often said that monetary policy has long and variable lags. How does continuing to buy assets now, even though it's at a slower pace, address the current inflation problem? Won't the impact of today's changes not really have any impact for six months or a year down the road on the current inflation problem? And aren't you actually lengthening that time by continuing to buy assets such that it could be not until the long and variable lag after you end purchases sometime in March that you'll start to have any impact on the inflation problem? CHAIR POWELL. So, on the first part of your question, which is, ""Why not stop purchasing now?,"" I would just say this: We've learned that, in dealing with balance sheet issues, we've learned that it's best to take a careful sort of methodical approach to make adjustments. Markets can be sensitive to it. And we thought that this was-this was a doubling of the speed. We're basically two meetings away now from finishing the taper. And we thought that was the appropriate way to go. So we announced it, and that's what will happen. You know, the question of long and variable lags is, is an interesting one. That's, that's Milton Friedman's famous statement. And I do think that in this world, where everything is-where the global financial markets are connected together, financial conditions can change very quickly. And my own sense is that they get into-financial conditions affect the economy fairly rapidly, longer than the traditional thought of, you know, a year or 18 months. Shorter than that, rather. But in addition, when we communicate about what we're going to do, the markets move immediately [in response] to that. So financial conditions are changing to reflect, you know, the forecasts that we made and basically, which was, I think, fairly in line with what markets were expecting. But financial conditions don't wait to change until, until things actually happen. They, they change on the expectation of things happening. So I don't think it's a question of having to wait. STEVE LIESMAN. Can I just follow up? Thinking about having to wait, is it still the policy, or the position, of the Committee that you will not raise rates until the taper is complete? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. The sense of that, of course, being that buying assets is adding accommodation and raising rates is removing accommodation. Since we're two meetings away from completing the taper, assuming things go as, as expected, I think if we wanted to lift off before then, then, then what we-you would stop the taper potentially sooner. But it's not something I expect to happen. But I do-I do not think it would be appropriate, and we-and we don't find ourselves in a situation where we-where we might have to raise rates while we're still purchasing assets. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let's go to Colby at the FT. COLBY SMITH. Thank you, Michelle. Chair Powell, I'm curious exactly how much distance you think there should be between the end of the taper and the first interest rate increase. Back in 2014, the guidance was-that was given was for the fed funds rate to remain at the target level for a considerable time after the end of the asset purchase program. Is that an approach you support now? Or does the current economic situation warrant something a bit different? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So we, we haven't made any decision of that nature. And so, no, I wouldn't say that's our position at all. We really haven't taken a position on that. I will say that we did talk today-We had our first discussion about the balance sheet, for example. And we went through the way-the sequence of events regarding the runoff and that sort of thing with the balance sheet, last time. And I think people thought that was an interesting discussion. They thought that it was informative, but people pointed out that this is a significantly different economic situation that we have at the current time, and that those-the differences that we see now would tend to influence how we think about the balance sheet. And the same thing would be true about raising rates. I don't-I don't foresee that there would be that kind of very extended wait at this time. The economy is so much stronger. I was here at the Fed when we lifted off the last time. And the economy is so much stronger now, so much closer to full employment. Inflation is running well above target, and growth is well above potential. There wouldn't be the need for that kind of long delay. Having said that, I-you know, we'll make this decision in coming meetings, and it's not-it's not a decision that the Committee has really focused on yet. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Nick at the Wall Street Journal. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you, Nick Timiraos at the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, in March you answered a question about maximum employment like this: You said 4 percent would be a nice unemployment rate to get to, but it'll take more than that to get to maximum employment. More recently, you have hinted at a possible distinction between the level of maximum employment that's achievable in the short run versus in the long run. Has your view of the level of maximum employment changed this year? And if so, how? And how close is the economy right now to your judgment of the short-run level of maximum employment? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So the-you know, the thing is, we're not going back to the same economy we had in February of 2020. And I think early on, that was-the sense was that that's where we were headed. The post-pandemic labor market, and the economy in general, will be different. And the maximum level of employment that's consistent with price stability evolves over time within a-within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic. So I would say: Look, we're, we're at 4.2 percent now and it's been-the unemployment rate has been dropping very quickly. So we're already in the vicinity of 4 percent. The way in which-The important metric that has been disappointing really has been labor force participation, of course, where we had widely thought-I had certainly thought-that, last fall, as unemployment insurance ran off, as vaccinations increased, [and] as schools reopened, that we would see a significant surge, if you will, or at least a surge, in labor force participation. So we've begun to see some improvement. We certainly welcome the 2/10 improvement that we got in the November report. But I do think that it's-it feels likely now that the return to higher participation is going to take longer. And, in fact, that's, that's been the pattern in past cycles-that labor force participation has tended to recover in the wake of a strong recovery in unemployment, which is what we're getting right now. So you-it could well have been that this cycle was different because of the short nature of it and the very strong-the number of job openings, for example, you would have thought that that would have pulled people back in. But, really, it's the pandemic, it's a range of factors. But the reality is, we don't have a strong labor force participation recovery yet, and we may not have it for some time. At the same time, we have to make policy now. And inflation is well above target. So this is something we need to take into-take into account. NICK TIMIRAOS. If I could-if I could follow up, you've talked recently about risk management. And so does that mean that the Committee might feel compelled to raise interest rates before you're convinced that you've achieved the employment test in your forward guidance? CHAIR POWELL. So this is-this is not at all a decision that the Committee has made. But you're really asking a question about how our framework works. And, yes, there is a-there's a provision, it used to be called the ""balanced approach"" provision, that says, in effect, that in situations in which the pursuit of the maximum-employment goal and [the pursuit of] the price-stability goal are not complementary, we have to take account of the distance from the goal and the-and the speed at which we're approaching it. And so that is, in effect, an ""off-ramp"" which could, in concept, be taken and it's in our framework, it's been in our framework a long time. I've talked about it on a number of occasions. It, it is a provision that would enable us to, in this case, because of high inflation, move before achieving maximum employment. Now, we're-as I said, we're making rapid progress toward maximum employment in my-in my thinking, in my opinion. And I don't at all know that we will-that we'll have to invoke that, that paragraph. But just as a factual matter, that is part of our framework-and has been, really, for a very long time. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We'll go to Howard at Reuters. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thanks, as usual. So I guess I gotta ask about the elephant in the room, which is the Omicron variant. You know, this seems to already be pushing one of your colleagues, the Bank of England, off its course. Things have evolved very fast there. Hasn't quite hit the shores of the U.S. in full force yet. But people seem to expect it to. So I'm wondering, in your feelings about this, are you convinced that this is going to be perhaps a more infectious, but less serious, variant of the virus? Or are you simply confident that the U.S. economy can continue its divorce from the pandemic? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think there's a lot of uncertainty, which is why we-why we called it out in our statement, our postmeeting statement, as a risk. It's-we, we follow the same experts and I-we, we talk privately to the same experts that everyone else does and read the same articles in the paper and the same research and, you know, so the-you mentioned the early assessment is highly transmissible, perhaps not as severe, some continuing protection from, from existing vaccines and also existing immunity from having had the disease. That's a first draft. We're a long way from knowing what it will turn out to be. It may well come to the United States and replace Delta as the dominant variant fairly quickly. That could easily happen. I think there's another step there, though-which is what's going to be the effect on the economy. And that will depend, you know, on how much it suppresses demand as opposed to suppressing supply. It is not clear how big the effects would be on either inflation or growth or hiring on top of what's already going on, which is quite a strong, you know, wave of Delta that's hitting large parts of the country across the northern United States and all the way to the eastern seaboard and now coming down. We're having quite a wave of Delta. So coming in on top of that, again, it's very difficult to say what the economic effects would be. I do think, wave upon wave, people are learning to live with this. More and more people are getting vaccinated. So [vaccinated] people who get the new variant, it affects them much less than it tends to affect, in the aggregate, people who are not vaccinated. So the more people get vaccinated, the less the economic effect. It doesn't mean it won't have an economic effect. Delta had an effect of slowing down hiring. And it actually-it had an effect on global supply chains. And that sort of-that hurt the process of the global supply chains getting worked out. So it can have an economic effect. I just think, at this point, we don't know much. We'll know a whole lot more in three weeks, and we'll know more than that in six weeks. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. But if I can follow up: You're clearly, sort of from a risk standpoint, comfortable putting away one of your tools pretty soon. Which sort of implies that whatever Omicron brings, you're comfortable the economy can handle it without quantitative easing. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. Yes, look, I think-if you look at the state of the economy and the amount-the strength of demand, the strength of just overall demand, and the strength of demand for labor, look at inflation, look at wages. I think moving, you know, moving forward the end of our taper by a few months is really-is really an appropriate thing to do. And I think, really, Omicron doesn't really have much to do with that. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Jeanna at the New York Times. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hey, Chairman Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what prompted your recent pivot toward greater wariness around inflation. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So I guess I would go back and-you know, it's been a continual process, really. Inflation really popped up, right? In the late spring last year. And we had a view-it was very, very widely held in the forecasting community-that this would be temporary. It was quite narrow, you know, a limited number of factors were causing it. And there was a decent amount of evidence to support that view, that it would be temporary or transitory, as we said. Certainly, we had five months of declining month on month-monthly readings of inflation, but we didn't see much in the way of progress on labor supply or on other supply-side issues. Then in September, I'd say after Labor Day, we started to see-it started to become clear that this was both larger in its effect on inflation and more persistent. And, of course, I said so on many occasions, and one of the consequences of that is that we move the taper forward. We moved the taper forward and we-and it's a much faster taper than had been planned. So we've been adapting-I've been saying we're adapting our policy. So coming to your real question, we got the ECI reading on the eve of the November meeting-it was the Friday before the November meeting-and it was very high, 5.7 percent reading for the employment compensation index for the third quarter, not annualized, for the third quarter, just before the meeting. And I thought for a second there whether we-whether we should increase our taper, [We] decided to go ahead with what we had-what we had ""socialized."" Then, right after that, we got the next Friday after the meeting, two days after the meeting, we got a very strong employment report and, you know, revisions to prior readings and, and no increase in labor supply. And the Friday after that, we got the CPI, which was a very hot, high reading. And I, honestly, at that point, really decided that I thought we needed to-we needed to look at, at speeding up the taper. And we went to work on that. So that's, that's really what happened. It was essentially higher inflation and faster-turns out much faster progress in the labor market. Really, what's happening is the unemployment rate is catching up-seems to be catching up-with a lot of the other readings of a tight labor market, 6/10 [decline] over one cycle. So that's really what happened and, you know, widely supported in the Committee today, as you can see-unanimous vote-but beyond that I think widely, widely supported, you know, this, this move. JEANNA SMIALEK. If I could just follow up quickly, you noted that the ECI was one of the things that made you nervous, but you also said earlier that you don't see signs that wages are actually factoring into inflation yet. And I guess I wonder how you think about sort of the wage picture as, as you're making these assessments. CHAIR POWELL. Right. So-but I said-you, you quoted me correctly. It's, it's-so far, we don't see-wages are not a big part of the high-inflation story that we're seeing. As you look forward, let's assume that the goods economy does sort itself out, and supply chains get working again, and maybe there's a rebalancing back to services and all that kind of thing. But what, what that leaves behind is the other things that can lead to persistent inflation. In particular-we don't see this yet, but if you had something where wages were persistently-[increases in] real wages were persistently above productivity growth, that puts upward pressure on, on firms, and they raise prices. It would take something that was persistent and material for that to happen. And we don't see that yet. But with the kind of hot labor market readings-wages we're seeing, it's something that we're-that we're watching. And the other thing, of course, is, is rents, which are very important. You know, owners' equivalent rent. That's another thing which is very economically sensitive. Unlike the things that are causing the inflation now, this is economically sensitive-and so would be expected to move up. And so as the-as some things go down, the question is: Where will we be when we come out the other side of this? And we need to keep our eyes on those things. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. We'll go to Chris at the AP. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Thank you. Well, next year, you could see growth slowing, and you could see some disinflation, particularly if the Omicron variant does spread more widely. Would you delay rate hikes in that situation? And how would you think about that? And also, how would you explain rate hikes if you do follow through, in that kind of situation, with inflation fading and growth slowing? How would you explain rate hikes to the public, particularly those who may still be looking for work? CHAIR POWELL. Well, as you know, you know, the SEP is not a plan. It's not something we debate, negotiate over, or really discuss in terms of what the right answer should be. People write down their, their assumptions-their assessment of appropriate policy based on their economic forecast. And so the median-what you're talking about, the three rate increases, that's the median of the Committee-the median of the Committee is also that growth will be 4 percent and then unemployment will be 3½ percent by the end of the year. So that's a really strong economy. And, of course, if the-if the economy turns out to be quite different from that, then so will the rate. You know, we-no one will say, ""Oh, we can't change our policy because we wrote something down in December."" No one's ever said that or will. It will-the actual rate decisions we make will depend on our evolving assessment of the forecast. So, for example, if, if the economy were to slow down significantly, then you would expect that that would have an effect of slowing down rate increases. But we'd have to-you know, we look at our two goals, maximum employment and price stability, and we make policy based on them, and not with respect to what we wrote down in a prior SEP. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Victoria Guida at Politico. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to follow up on maximum employment. So, you know, the new framework was basically designed, as I understand it, so that there was a de-emphasis on guessing where inflation would pick up because of employment. And, basically, you were going to wait until you saw the whites of the eyes of inflation. And that's how you would kind of know that you reached maximum employment. So, I'm wondering, you know, you've talked a lot about the different ways that you might measure maximum employment. But from what I understand, that's still basically: The way that you know that you're there is inflation. So is that understanding correct? And how is-are those signals likely to be clear right now given that you have inflation that's caused by, you know, these supply chain disruptions that might also lead to, you know, inflation in wages and those sorts of things? So how do you sort of, like, tease out the signal of maximum employment? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So let me start by saying that the inflation that we got was not at all the inflation we were looking for or talking about in the framework. This was-it really was a completely different thing. It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve. So, you know, automobile purchases are very interest rate-sensitive, and you would think demand would drive up the quantity of cars, But it can't, because they don't have semiconductors. So, so that-it was a very different kind of inflation. This is not the inflation we were looking for under our framework at all. It's nothing to do with our framework. And our-the way we've approached it is really nothing to do with our framework. But coming to maximum employment, which is really your question. How do you know? So I think you look at, you know, prices and quantities. When you-if you want to look at maximum employment, you look at prices and quantities, and the main price you look at is wages. It's one of the things you look at. And, you know, it's-So I mentioned a number of other things. You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of-you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus. And wages, that's, that's really one of the great signals. The quits rate is another one. The quits rate is really one of the very best indicators, according to a lot of labor economists, because people quit because they feel like they can get a better job. And there's, you know, record amounts, historically high levels of that going on-suggesting, again, that you've got a very tight labor market. So on wages, that's the price indicator we look at to tell us, along with all the other data, whether we're-whether we have labor market conditions that are consistent with maximum employment. And so that's, that's how we think about it. But the-one of the complications is that, again, we've got to make policy in real time. So how do we think about that? Do we-if we think we can make labor, you know, participation might move up-if we, let's say we knew that it would start to move up in two years, would we wait two years when inflation is running way above target? Probably not, you know, so you have to make an assessment that what's max-what is the level of maximum employment that is consistent with price stability in real time is, is one way to think about it. VICTORIA GUIDA. Just to kind of follow up on that for a second, if you do raise interest rates next year and, you know, it's-you're not certain whether you're at maximum employment, are you all going to point-when you raise interest rates, are you going to point to ways in which the labor market could still improve? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. I mean, I-absolutely. I, I think-well, whether or not we-whether or not we say ""we're at conditions-labor market conditions consistent with, with maximum employment"" next year, we would all be open and I think expect, over time, that the level of maximum employment that's consistent with price stability would increase further over time-for example, through increasing participation. So I-we would certainly-we would not, in any way, want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better. But, again, with inflation as high as it is, we have to make policy in real time. We've got to make that assessment in real time. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Olivia from Bloomberg. OLIVIA ROCKEMAN. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chair Powell, and thank you for taking our questions. I wanted to follow up on some of your earlier comments about labor force participation. And I wondered, what do you think needs to change in the economy to kind of get a meaningful recovery in labor force participation, and also whether running the economy hot, like in the last expansion, is one way of doing that? CHAIR POWELL. Well, the labor market is, by so many measures, hotter than it ever ran in the last-in the last expansion, if you think about it. You know, the ratio of job openings, for example, to, to vacancies is at all-time highs. Quits, the wages-all those things are, are even hotter. But what would it take for labor force participation to move up more? You know, that's-really, ""Why is it low?"" is the question. So there, there are a bunch of answers, and all of them probably have some, you know, some validity. Part of it will be that people-for certain people, they don't want to go back in the labor force because either they're medically vulnerable or they're not comfortable going back while COVID is still everywhere. That's one thing. The lack of availability of childcare made for caretakers is certainly part of it-not just for children, but for older people. It has been pointed out by many that the stock market is high, people's portfolios are stronger-they may go back to being a one-income rather than a two-income family. The same thing with people's houses. People buy-they have a mortgage, you know, with leverage, and the house price increases, the equity they have in their home might have doubled. And they might make-reach the same conclusion. So they're-and people have savings on their balance sheet because of forced savings because they couldn't spend on travel and things like that and also because of, you know, because of government transfers. So, for all of those reasons-and it's hard to know exactly the part each of them plays-we, we have a situation where we've had a shock to labor force participation that is not unwinding as quickly as, as many, as expected. And people-in effect, a good part of it is voluntary. You know, people-and this is how they want to maximize their welfare and that's, that's their, certainly their choice. In other cases, it's something that will abate very quickly if and when the pandemic gets under control. And the longer the pandemic goes on, you know, maybe the less likely that people will come back because they're-you know, they get used to their new life and they lose contact with their old jobs. That's, that's what the evidence would say. So it's a range of things. It isn't that the economy lacks stimulus. You know, usually, in every other expansion, it's that there aren't enough jobs and people can't find jobs and, you know, we're stimulating demand and trying to get demand to come up. That's not the problem here. The problem is a supply-side problem, which-what it would take to work it out, I think it's going to be time. And the number-one thing would, would really be to have the pandemic get under control. That's what everyone would really like to see: What does the labor force-what does the labor market look like in a world without COVID? That would be the thing that we'd really like to see but, you know, it doesn't look like that's coming anytime soon. OLIVIA ROCKEMAN. And just to quickly follow up on that: If some of the reason that labor force participation isn't back to, you know, February 2020 levels is because people are voluntarily making life decisions that are different, does that make you think we're going to end up at a lower rate overall? CHAIR POWELL. Well, there's a demographic trend underlying all of this. And we actually got above the demographic trend at the end of the last expansion. But-so one would expect over time that labor force participation would, would move down because an aging population, the older people are, the lower their participation rate is. So you would expect that, that the trend would be lower and that, over time, participation would move down. The question of how much we can get back up closer to where we were in February of 2020-and, indeed, for the year or so before that-is a good one. And, I mean, I-What we can do is try to create the conditions. There's a lot of good for society when you have a tight but stable labor market, where people are coming in, they're getting into the labor force, they're getting paid well. In the labor market we had before, we had, you know-the biggest wage increases were going to people at the bottom end of the wage spectrum for the last couple of years. There were just a lot of really desirable aspects of a labor market like that. Higher participation is one of them. And we'd love to get back there. But, again, ultimately, we have the tools that we have, which are essentially to stimulate demand and also to control inflation. I mean, really, it might be-one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation, because, to get back to where we were, the evidence grows that it's going to take some time. And what we need is another long expansion, like the ones we've been having. Over the last 40 years, we've had, I think, three of the four longest in our recorded history, including the last one, which was the longest in our recorded history. That's what it would really take to get back to the kind of labor market we'd like to see. And to have that happen, we need to make sure that we maintain price stability. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let's go to Edward Lawrence at Fox. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks. Thanks, Michelle, and thanks for taking the question, Chair Powell. So I was looking at the consensus data for estimated monthly changes on sales. And what you're seeing is fewer people spending at restaurants and drinking places, more people spending at grocery stores. You see electronic sales down 4.6 percent month over month, also department store sales down 5.4 percent month over month. How concerned or what is your level of concern the consumer may be turning away from this economy or pulling back because of inflation, the virus, or something else? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. We see consumer expense as very strong in this quarter. I don't know, Edward, whether you're talking about more shopping online versus shopping in the store, but consumer demand is very strong, incomes are very strong, you know, because people are going back to work and they're getting wage increases. Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation. But, nonetheless, incomes, overall, are going up really significantly because of increased employment and spending is-has been strong. There may be something in the seasonality that this year's holiday spending may have been pulled forward. And, of course, there may be effects from, from Delta and there might be going forward from Omicron. But fundamentally, though, the consumer is really healthy, and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the fourth quarter. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, let's go to Mike at Bloomberg. MICHAEL MCKEE. Mr. Chairman, the median forecast for inflation in this month's or this meeting's economic projections has been revised up significantly for 2021 but barely moved for 2022 and 2023. You've said you expect inflation to fall significantly. Is that because you're going to raise interest rates or because the virus is going to fade and the effects are going to fade? In other words, is it a question of when, not if, you raise interest rates? And does it suggest that maybe your critics are correct and you might be afraid you're ""behind the curve""? CHAIR POWELL. So, actually, I'm looking at the SEP here, and the median forecasts for core and headline inflation did move up by 4/10 each. So that's a significant-you know, in an SEP, that's a pretty significant move up. You know, it's, it's based on both of those things, I suppose. I do think there's a broad expectation among forecasters, including our own, that the bottlenecks will alleviate sometime over the course of this year. If you look at where Blue Chip forecasts are-which is, you know, a group of well-resourced, large forecasting operations with a long track record-they'll show inflation coming back down significantly toward the back-end of next year. I would say, though, as well that our policy should begin to have an effect. There will be a lag, but it should begin to have an effect on that as well. And, you know, that's the most likely case. I guess what-the thing I would want to say, though, is we can't act as though that's a certainty, and we're not going to act as though that's a certainty. There's a real risk now, we believe, I believe, that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure, and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased. It's certainly increased. I don't think it's high at this moment, but I think it's increased. And I think that's part of the reason behind our move today. [It] is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk. And I think we are in a position to deal with that risk. We need to see more data. We need to see how the inflation data and the-all the data evolve in coming months, but we are prepared to, you know, to use our tools to make sure that higher inflation doesn't get entrenched. For one reason, as I-as I just mentioned, it's one of the two big threats, the other being the pandemic itself, to getting back to maximum employment. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Michael Derby at the Wall Street Journal. MICHAEL DERBY. Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. So as the Fed shifts towards an accelerated taper, I wonder what your read is on financial-stability risks right now. I mean, these periods can be-you know, it seems like the taper process has gone fairly smooth so far. But, you know, what do you see in terms of stability risks? Are there any parts of the financial sector that concern you right now? And are there any significant systemic issues that are on your radar, you know, maybe from the cryptocurrency sector or something like that? CHAIR POWELL. You know, we have-we have had now for a decade and more a four-part financial stability framework that we use so we can-we can hold ourselves to the same kind of framework and, you know, not just treat each event individually. And there are four key areas: asset valuations, debt owed by households and businesses, funding risk, and leverage among financial institutions. So I would say asset valuations-I'm going to go really superficially here, but asset valuations are somewhat elevated, I would say. Debt owed by businesses, you know, and households-households are in very strong financial shape. Businesses actually have a lot of debt, but their default rates are very, very low. But, nonetheless, it's something we're watching. Funding risk is, by and large, low among, among financial institutions. But we do see money market funds as a vulnerability and, and, you know, would applaud the SEC's action this week. Leverage among financial institutions is low, in the sense that [their] capital is high. So, overall, you know, financial stability, that's how-I wouldn't make an overall characteristic, but we break it down into those pieces. In terms of the things, you know, that we're-that we're looking for, looking at, you know, it's the-it's the things we've already talked about, to some extent. It's, it's the emergence of a new variant that could, you know, that could lead to significant economic-if there were to be a variant, for example, [and if] that were quite resistant to vaccines, it could have another significant effect on the economy. We don't see that. We don't have any basis for thinking that the new variant that we have is that one, but it's certainly one we're looking at. I would say, you know, cyber risk, the risk of a successful cyberattack, is, for me, you know, always the most-you know, one that would be very difficult to deal with. I think we know how to deal with bad loans and things like that. I think more-a cyberattack that were to take down a major financial institution or financial market utility would be a really significant financial stability risk that we haven't actually faced yet. So I could go on with a list of ""horribles,"" but I think that's a decent picture of where I would start. MICHAEL DERBY. How about the cryptocurrency issues? Anything that worries you there that's going on in there in terms of-you know, obviously a lot's happening in that sector. Does that concern you at all? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think the concerns there are not so much current financial-stability concerns. I, of course, would support the, the views expressed in the President's Working Group report on stablecoins. Stablecoins can certainly be a useful, efficient, consumer-serving, part of the financial system, if they're properly regulated. And, right now, they aren't. And, and they have the potential to scale [up], particularly if they were to be, you know, associated with one of the very large tech networks that exist and you could have a payment network that was immediately systemically important-close to immediately systemically important that didn't have appropriate regulation and protections. The public relies on the government-and [on] the Fed, in particular-to make sure that the payment system is safe and reliable, as well as the dollar and-you know, to provide a safe and reliable trusted currency. So-but I do think those are longer term. In terms of, you know, the more-the cryptocurrencies, you know, that are really speculative assets, I don't see them as a financial-stability concern at the moment. I do think they are risky, they're not backed by anything, and I think there's big consumer-issues for consumers who may or may not understand what they're getting. And there's certainly developments in the-in the markets that are worth following, which are really not in our jurisdiction, but things like, you know, the kind of leverage that's built into and those sorts of things is certainly worth, worth watching. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Nancy Marshall-Genzer at Marketplace. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Chair Powell. Hi, Chair Powell, thanks for the question. Going back to inflation, is the Fed ""behind the curve"" on getting inflation under control? CHAIR POWELL. So I would say this. I actually think we are well positioned to deal with, with what's coming, with the range of plausible outcomes that can come. I do. And I think if you look at how we got here, I do think we've, we've been adapting to the incoming data, really all the way along, and, you know, noticing and calling out that, that the-both the effects and the persistence of inflation of bottlenecks and labor shortages and things like that. So we've been calling out the fact that those were becoming longer, and more persistent, and larger. And now we're in a position where we're ending our taper within the next-well, by March, in two meetings, and we'll be in a position to raise interest rates as and when we think it's appropriate. And we will, if that-to the extent that's appropriate. At the same time, we're going to be seeing a few more months of data. I don't actually think we're out of position now. I think this was an important move for us to make. I think that the data that we got toward the end of the fall was a-was a really strong signal that inflation is more persistent and higher-and that the risk of it remaining higher for longer has grown. And I think we're reacting to that now. And we'll continue to adapt our policy. So I wouldn't look at it that we're ""behind the curve."" I would look at it that we're actually in position now to take the steps that we'll need to take, you know, in a thoughtful manner to address all of the issues, including that of, of too-high inflation. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Evan at Market News. EVAN RYSER. Hi, Chair Powell. Thank you. I was wondering if we should still be seeing the taper and interest rate hikes as separate. And, secondly, in the last cycle, the Fed started shrinking the balance sheet when short-term interest rates were about 1 to 1¼ percent range. Do you think the FOMC might be able to potentially start running off assets before that this time? CHAIR POWELL. Are they separate? So our interest rate-I mean, they are separate tools. So the-you know, the, the asset purchases are a separate tool from interest rates. Stopping asset purchases does not remove accommodation. It just stops adding further accommodation. Whereas raising interest rates starts to remove accommodation from what is a highly accommodative stance. You know, the extent to which they'll be separated in time is, is something we haven't really discussed at the Committee [meetings] yet. We will be discussing that, obviously, in coming meetings. I don't think that, that-the last cycle, there was quite a long separation before interest rates. I don't think that's at all likely in this cycle. We're in a very, very different place with high inflation, strong growth, a really strong economy. You know, that-as I mentioned, the SEP medians are for 4 percent growth next year, 3½ percent-3½ percent unemployment at the end of the year, and the, the-you know, headline inflation of 2.6 percent next year, core at 2.7. So this is a strong economy, one in which it's appropriate for, for interest rate hikes. So they're separate, I would say. Your-sorry, your second question was? EVAN RYSER. My second question was about runoff. CHAIR POWELL. Runoff. EVAN RYSER. In the last cycle. CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, with the balance sheet, we did have a balance sheet discussion, sort of a prelim-a first, first discussion of balance sheet issues today, [balance] sheet issues, at our meeting this week. We'll have another at the next meeting and another at the meeting after that I suspect. These are interesting issues to discuss. [We] didn't make any decisions today. We looked back at what happened in the last cycle, and people thought that was interesting and informative. And-but to one degree or another, people noted that this is just a different situation, and those differences should inform the decisions we make about the balance sheet this time. So [we] haven't made any decisions at all about, about when runoff would start, but we're-we'll be continuing to-you know, in relation to when either liftoff happens or the end of the taper. But those are exactly the decisions we'll be turning to in coming meetings. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. We'll go to Scott Horsley at NPR. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I think you said a few minutes ago that the inflation that we got during the pandemic was not the inflation that we-that you anticipated when you crafted the framework. And you described it as a collision of a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus with these supply-side hiccups. Does that mean the stimulus was mistaken, or is the inflation just a consequence of-that we have to put up with because of that? CHAIR POWELL. No, I'm not expressing any judgment about, about the stimulus in, in that comment. What I'm saying is, there's a-there's a sense among some that ""you wanted inflation, this is what you wanted, how do you like it?,"" you know? And the truth is, this is not the inflation that we were-what we were talking about in the-in the framework was inflation that comes from a tight labor market, right? So we had 3½ percent unemployment for a period, and we had inflation that was just barely getting to 2 percent. And I-you know, I think, in that setting, our thinking was, we can afford to wait to raise rates until we see actual inflation rather than [acting] preemptive[ly] because, you know, no one had seen what 3½ percent unemployment would look like-with high labor force participation, by the way. No one had seen what it would look-really look like for an extended period, for decades. And we didn't know what the inflationary implications were. It turned out there was barely 2 percent inflation-and no sense that it was gaining momentum and that kind of thing. So we incorporated that into our framework. This is something completely different. You know, that's a situation where you had a very, very high level of employment and low inflation. This is literally the opposite. Or, you know, it has been the opposite, where we have very high inflation and we've had it since the labor market was in terrible shape. It had nothing-so far, this inflation has really nothing to do with tightness in the labor market. It does have to do with, with strong demand, and strong demand was supported by the Fed, it was supported by Congress. I'm not making any judgments on Congress, it's not my job. But I will just say, we're coming out of a, you know, what we certainly hope will be a once in a lifetime, certainly historic-the first really global modern pandemic-which looked at the beginning like it might cause a global depression. And, you know, so we threw a lot of support at it [the economy]. And what's coming out now is, is, you know, really strong growth, really strong demand, high incomes, and all that kind of thing. You know, people will judge in 25 years whether we-whether we overdid it or not, but, you know, the reality is, we are where we are. And, you know, we think our policy is, is the right one for the situation that we're in. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. Let's go to Brian Cheung. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Chairman Powell. Wanted to ask about the bond markets. When you see the 10-year at 146 basis points, do you have any sort of concerns about an environment by which you might be hiking interest rates into? Would you prefer the curve be a little bit steeper? What are you gleaning from the bond market actions over the last six weeks? CHAIR POWELL. So I, I think the short-end actions are easy to understand, which is, you know, they're basically very [monetary] policy-sensitive rates at the short end, and it makes sense that it's reacting to changes in expectations for policy. I think a lot of things go into the, you know, the long rates. And the place I would start is just look at global sovereign yields around the world. Look at JGBs, look at bunds, and they're so much lower. You can get-you can get, you know, a much higher yield on U.S. Treasuries by buying USTs rather than bunds and you can-you can hedge, hedge the currency risk back into yen, back into euros and still be way ahead. So, in a way, it's not surprising that there's a lot of demand for, for U.S. sovereigns in a world-you know, in a risk-free world where, where there's so much-they're yielding so much more than bunds are, than JGBs. So that's, that's a big part of it. I also think, you know, there, there may be some assessment in there of what the neutral rate is or what the terminal rate is. I don't know about that. But-and I would just say that we, you know, we write down our own estimates of the-of the terminal rate or the neutral rate of interest. Those are highly uncertain. And, you know, we'll make policy based on what we're seeing in the economy rather than based on what a neutral-what a model might say the neutral rate is. We, we all had the experience of the last cycle, where we all, through that cycle, were trying to estimate what the neutral rate was, and it turned out-you know, I think we learned a lot from seeing what happens. We ended up cutting rates three times after raising them to 2¼ to 2½ percent. So I'm not troubled by where the long bond [rate] is. You know, I see that it's low. You know, I mean, we're really focused on broader financial conditions, [and] we're focused on maximum employment and price stability. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you. For the last question, we'll go to Greg Robb. GREG ROBB. Thank you very much. Chair Powell, I was wondering if-I wanted to give you the opportunity to talk about something that I've heard that's been discussed-that, you know, your pivot towards a tighter policy, hawkish policy stance had something to do with the timing of your renomination by the President. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure, I'd be happy to talk about that. So, as I mentioned, we got the ECI reading just before the November meeting. We got the labor market report two days after the meeting. And then, one week after that, I think on the 12th of November, we got the CPI reading. It was really the CPI reading, in concert with those two, and I, I just came to the view over that weekend that we needed to speed up the taper. And we started working on that. That's a full 10 days or so before the President made a decision of renominating me. So, honestly, it had-it had nothing to do with that at all. And I just thought this is what we got to do. My colleagues were out talking about the-a faster taper. And that doesn't happen by accident. They were out talking about a faster taper before the President made his decision. So it's a decision that effectively was in-more than in train and, you know, to the point where people were talking about it publicly. So that's what happened. And it had absolutely nothing to do with it whatsoever. We're always going to just do what we think is the right thing, and I certainly will always just do what I think the right thing is for the economy and for the people that we serve. GREG ROBB. Just a quick follow-up. I guess that some people are saying that it was the, you know, the stimulus in March that was sort of over-we didn't really need all that stimulus, and that there was talk even then that that would be a mistake and it would lead to higher inflation. And perhaps that you didn't push back as much as you might have otherwise. CHAIR POWELL. I didn't push back at all. And the reason I didn't-and there was no-there was lots of talk about that, but not from the Fed, because that is not our job. We are not the CBO, and we're not elected by anybody. So we take fiscal policy as it arrives at our front door, and we don't comment-you know, we make our own assessments inside the Fed, but it's really not our role. And I think, very important, that we stay out of that business, no matter who's in the White House, who's in Congress. It's just-it's just not our job and it's something we avoid pretty, pretty assiduously. GREG ROBB. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Thank you. MICHELLE SMITH. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, everyone."
