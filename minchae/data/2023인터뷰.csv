"MICHELLE SMITH. Chris. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press. Thank you for doing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder? And could you see lifting rates higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in-or to offset the easing of financial conditions? CHAIR POWELL. So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect the policy restraint that we're putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent. And, of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial conditions. And it is our judgment that we're not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things affect financial conditions-not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial conditions along with many other factors as we set policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter, we've seen a deceleration in prices, in wages, and a fall in consumer spending, all while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a historic low. Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you're looking for? CHAIR POWELL. So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage. What you see is, really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated. So you see that. In the other-in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be lower. So, in those two sectors, you've got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector called nonhousing service-core nonhousing services, where we don't see disinflation yet. But I would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market conditions. RACHEL SIEGEL. Has your-I'm sorry. CHAIR POWELL. Go ahead. RACHEL SIEGEL. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go changed since December? CHAIR POWELL. No. We're going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, and we'll see at that time. I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now getting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data. So-but, you know, we'll update those forecasts in March. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. You and some of your colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the December JOLTS this morning. Job openings are actually rising. That also coincided with slowdown in wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading? CHAIR POWELL. So you're right about the data, of course. What we did see-we've seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job openings number has-in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently. Yeah, I did see that it moved up-back up this morning. I do think that it's probably an important indicator. The ratio, I guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. So it's an indicator, but nonetheless, we-you're right, we do see wages moving down. If you look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation. And, you know, quits are still at an elevated level. So many, many-by many, many indicators, the job market is still very strong. MICHELLE SMITH. Colby, and then Howard. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the economic data since the December meeting, is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most recent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward? Or does ongoing now mean more than two rate rises now? CHAIR POWELL. So you're right. At the December meeting, we all wrote down our best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that's obviously back in December. And the median for that was between 5 and 5Â¼ percent. At the March meeting, we're going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent. We think we've covered a lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened. I would say we still think there's work to do there. We haven't made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think, you know, we're going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March meeting and then the May meeting. I don't feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It could certainly be higher than we're writing down right now. If we come to the view that we need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would certainly do that. At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we'll, you know, we'll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course. COLBY SMITH. Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or going beyond that level? CHAIR POWELL. I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it's very difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually were close but didn't get the job done. Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in. And now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a very difficult risk to manage, whereas I-of course, we have no incentive and no desire to overtighten. But we, you know, if we feel like we've gone too far, we can certainly-and inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that. So I do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, the job is not fully done. As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 56 percent of the core inflation index where we don't see disinflation yet. So we don't see it. It's not happening yet. Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 percent on a 6- and 12-month basis. So there's not-nothing happening there. In the other two sectors representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is credible, that's coming together, although you don't actually see disinflation yet in housing services, but it's in the pipeline, right? So, for the third sector, we don't see anything here. So I think it would be premature-it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that we've really got this. We need to see-our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they should be coming into play to have inflation-the disinflationary process begin in that sector. But, so far, we don't see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work left to do. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual. So I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here. The statement made a number of changes that seem to be saying things are getting better. You're saying inflation has eased That's new. You've taken out references to the war in Ukraine that's causing price increases. You've taken out references to the pandemic. You've eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were being driven higher, yet that's not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still have ongoing increases to come. So I'm wondering, why is that the case? And does it have more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it, really, in goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. We-this is what we thought would happen since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought. We-you know, it's supply chains, it's shortages, and it's demand revolving back towards services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that's, you know, around a quarter of the PCE price index-core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services, and that's driven by very different things. And we-as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that's sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little less than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this is good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core goods ex. housing-sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about. We don't see it yet. It's-you know, it's seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the same. And, you know, we have a sense of what's going on in each of those different subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be important. Some of the other ones it's-the labor market is not going to be important. Many other factors will drive it. In any case, we don't see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think we need to see that it's the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate. So it's not that we're not-we're neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We're just telling you that we don't see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we don't see it yet. Until we do, I think we-you know, we see ourselves, we've got to be honest with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent-we'll see more persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we're just going to have to-we have to complete the job. You know, that's what we're here for. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you observed several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above-target inflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high level despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again? CHAIR POWELL. So we've-you know, we've raised rates 4Â½ percentage points, and we're talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately restrictive. And why do we think that's probably necessary? We think, because inflation is still running very hot. We're, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we're thinking about that. It really-the story we're telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way we understand it is basically the three things that I've just gone through a couple of times. And, again, we don't see it affecting the services sector ex. housing yet. But, I mean, I think our assessment is that we're not very far from that level. We don't know that, though. We don't know that. So I think we're-you know, we're living in a world of significant uncertainty. I would look across the rate-the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by-you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is restrictive. We're trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That's all. And we're going to-you know, that's why we're slowing down to 25 basis points. We're going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of the disinflationary process. NICK TIMIRAOS. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this meeting this week? CHAIR POWELL. We-you know, you'll see that the minutes will come out in three weeks, and we'll give you a lot of detail. I-you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the path ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn't want to start to drive the-describe all the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the path forward. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given that we've now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U.S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? CHAIR POWELL. So your question is, would we-say your question again. VICTORIA GUIDA. Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints? CHAIR POWELL. So you're really asking about-you're asking about prioritization, in effect, is what- VICTORIA GUIDA. Yes. Yes. CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So I feel like I have to say this. There's only one way forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States government can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent. And I'm just going to leave it at that. VICTORIA GUIDA. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the event that that would happen? CHAIR POWELL. I'm just going to leave it at that. This is a matter that's to be resolved between, really-it's really Congress' job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there are discussions happening, but they don't involve us. We're not involved in those discussions. So we're the fiscal agent. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna and then Steve. JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases and then restarting them? Lorie Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to suggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that view is broadly shared on the Committee. CHAIR POWELL. So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause. We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. So that's the judgment that we made. You know, we're going to write down new forecasts in March, and we'll-you know, we'll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will. JEANNA SMIALEK. Sorry, I should have been clearer. I mean, would it be possible to take a meeting off, for example, and then resume? You know, could you, rather than just doing at every meeting that move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves? CHAIR POWELL. I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking about or exploring in any kind of detail. In principle, though, you know, we used to-the thing we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was considered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they're willing to raise rates after pausing. But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding right now. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent. Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent, and you've achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have penciled in for this year. And you've also achieved it without the 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I'm wondering if you've considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong, and it's possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge in unemployment. And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair Lael Brainard, who said, ""To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors."" In other words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get this sector of inflation under control. Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, if-you're right-if you take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE-core PCE inflation, they're quite low right now. But that's because that's driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from goods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of something around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example. So that's really where the sustainable level is. It's more like at 4 percent. So that would suggest there's work left to do. You know, let's say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible. As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent. We would take that into account. In terms of the non-sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it's a very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that-subsectors of that sector are-we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not. And, for example, you know, financial services is a big sector that's really not driven by labor markets-wages. So that's why I said there are a number of things that will affect-take restaurants, right? So, clearly, labor is important for restaurants but so are food prices. And, you know, transportation services is going to be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive inflation. I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you're not going to have, you know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the labor market. And I don't know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can soften. And so far, we've got-as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down without the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that unemployment will probably rise a bit from here. But I still think-I continue to think that there's a path to getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a significant increase in unemployment. And that's because the-you know, the setting we're in is quite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior-you know, in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think will-a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough. But I think there is-there's ongoing disinflation, and we don't yet see weakening in the labor market. So we'll have to see. STEVE LIESMAN. Can we get there with 5 percent? CHAIR POWELL. Certainly possible. Yeah. Absolutely it's possible. You know, it's a question-no one really knows. I think it's because this is not like the other business cycles in so many ways. It may well be that as-yeah, as-that it will take more slowing than we expect-than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent. But I don't-that's not my base case. My base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant downturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that's a possible outcome. I think many, many forecasters would say it's not the most likely outcome. But I would say there's a chance of it. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. I'd like to pick up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there's still a lot of talk about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023. And the recession indicators are all suggesting that we are going to see recession this year. So I'm wondering if you've changed your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is going forward and whether you're very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which calls for more restraint on your part. CHAIR POWELL. So I do think you-most forecasts and, you know, my own assessment would be that that growth will continue-positive growth will continue but at a subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of-GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent. I think, you know, most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly subdued level this year. There are other factors, though, that need to be considered. You will have seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially. The labor market remains very, very strong, and that's job creation, that's wages. As inflation does come down, sentiment will improve. You also-state and local governments are really flush these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending checks. So I think that's going to support-they're also spending a lot. There's a lot of spending coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public. And so that's going to support economic activity. So I think there's a good chance that those factors will help support positive growth this year. And that's my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Rich. RICH MILLER. Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg. First off, how are you doing? CHAIR POWELL. Fine. Thanks. Fine. RICH MILLER. Good. Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some idea of what you're thinking of? You mentioned three months-that we've seen three months in a row. Governor Waller suggested he might want to see six months. And so is it just the inflation data, or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have that ""substantially more evidence"" metric? CHAIR POWELL. So I don't think there's, you know, going to be a light switch flipped or anything like that. I think it's just an accumulating-accumulation of evidence. So, of course, we'll be looking-by the time of the March meeting, we'll have two more employment reports, two more CPI reports, and we'll be looking at those carefully as all of us will. And we'll be asking ourselves, what are they telling us? And soon after that, we'll have another ECI wage report, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it's very complete. And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some-was constructive. It's-you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level. They're still at a level that's way above-well above where they were before the pandemic. So I don't want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it's going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy over time. But I will say, though, we-you know, it is our job to restore price stability and achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. We're not-market participants have a very different job. It's a fine job. It's a great job. In fact, I did that job for years but in one form or another. But, you know, we have to deliver that. And so we are strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking the questions. So you've talked about we had solid job growth. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business, by the way. We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer spending. It seems so far it's been relatively mild from the economy to go to-from a 9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation. Is the hard part yet to come to go from 6.5 to 2? CHAIR POWELL. I don't think we know, honestly. You know, the-so we, of course, expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn't come down all through '22. And now it's coming down, and it's come down pretty fast. So I would say these are-this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what we did. It's just-it's unique. So I think certainty is just not appropriate here. Inflation-it's just harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster. It may take longer to come down. And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that. But I think we're going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think that the game is won because, you know, it's-we've got a long way to go. It's just-it's the early stages of disinflation. And it's most welcome to be able to say that we are now in disinflation, but that's great. But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that it's going to take some time. That's all. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Do you-how long do you see then, the federal funds rate remaining at this elevated level? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so-again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you will see from the SEP and-I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it's a forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down steadily but not quickly. And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that's a different thing. You know, if that happens-inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we'll be seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy. MICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. May I ask a further question about the language around ""ongoing increases?"" That, of course, implies at least two further rate rises. If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the implication is that you'll raise rates one more time and then pause. Are you concerned about that divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome? CHAIR POWELL. I'm not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is largely due to the market's expectation that inflation will move down more quickly. I think that's the bigger part of that. So, again, as I just mentioned, we-you know, our forecasts-different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession. And we have inflation moving down, you know, into the-somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower than that this year. We'll update that in March, but that's what we thought in December. Markets are past that. They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that. So we'll just have to see. And we have a different view and-a different view, it's a different forecast, really. And given our outlook, I just-I don't see us cutting rates this year if we get-if our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now. If we do see inflation coming down much more quickly, that'll play into our policy setting, of course. MICHELLE SMITH. Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY. Hi, Chair Powell. Scott Horsley from NPR. One of the changes in the statement this month is that the Committee is no longer listing public health as among the data points you'll consider in assessing conditions. What should we make of that? Does the Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy? CHAIR POWELL. That's the general sense of it. Look, we understand-I personally understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it's no longer playing an important role in our economy. And, you know, we've kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think we just-we knew we would take it out at some point. There's never a perfect time, but we thought that-you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are handling it better now. It doesn't really need to be in a-you know, in the Fed's monthly, you know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health issue. MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said recently. She said she doesn't see signs of a wage-price spiral, and I'm wondering if you agree with that. CHAIR POWELL. I do. Yeah, I do. You don't see that yet. But the whole point is, you know, if you-once you see it, you have a serious problem. That means that, effectively, in people's decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue. And once that happens-that's what we can't allow to happen. And, you know, so that's why we worry that the longer we're at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know, the more risk of something like that. But no, there's not much-it's more of a risk. It always has been more of a risk than anything else. By the way, I think it's becoming less salient. And people are-you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I've seen some data, too, that show people are, you know, gradually-they're glad that inflation is coming down. People really don't like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they're very, very low with 3Â½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So that's what you're looking at most closely, is consumer expectations? CHAIR POWELL. That's at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, are the-essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of the process of creating inflation. That's a sort of bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to be. We think it's important. And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so, longer-term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. Expectations are-seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer end. So it's, you know-and that's-I think that's very reassuring. I think, you know, the markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 2 percent and it's just a matter of us following through. That's immeasurably helpful to the process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will come down, that'll be part of the process of getting it down. And it's a very positive thing. MICHELLE SMITH. Greg. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as important, when the Committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I haven't seen-heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering, has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you're concerned about? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. I would put it this way. It's something that we monitor carefully. Financial conditions didn't really change much from the December meeting to now. They mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It's important that the markets do reflect the tightening that we're putting in place. As we've discussed a couple times here, there's a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast inflation will come down. We're just going to have to see. I mean, I'm not going to try to persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and some patience and that we'll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we'll see. MICHELLE SMITH. Brendan, for the last question. BRENDAN PEDERSEN. Hi, Chair Powell. Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News. I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline. Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop-dead deadline this summer? CHAIR POWELL. Look, I-it's very hard to think about all the different possible ramifications. And I think the answer is, basically, I don't think there's likely to be any important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and-as it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn't risk, you know, the progress we're making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that that will happen. I believe it will happen. You know, we, of course, will monitor money market conditions carefully as-you know, as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up. And we understand there'll be lots of flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that. We're watching it carefully. We'll just be monitoring it. Thank you very much."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they're envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate. CHAIR POWELL. So, taking your question-of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A, a decision on a pause was not made today. You will have noticed that in the-in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is, is not in, in the statement anymore. We took that out, and instead we're saying that, in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors. So we-that's a-that's a meaningful change that we're no longer saying that we anticipate. And so we'll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting. And, you know, we'll approach that question at the June meeting. So the-the staff's forecast is-so let me say-start by saying that that's not my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a modest rate this year. And I think that's-so different people on the Committee have different forecasts. That's, that's my own assessment of the most likely path. [The] staff produces its own forecast, and it's independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course. And we think this is a healthy thing-that the, the staff is writing down what they really think. They're not especially influenced by what the Governors think, and vice versa. The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down. So it's actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives. So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is-has been typical in modern-era recessions. I wouldn't want to characterize the staff's forecast for this meeting. We'll, we'll leave that to the minutes-but broadly, broadly similar to that. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt-limit standoff. You've said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default? And what type of situation would that look like? CHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn't want to speculate specifically, but I will say this: These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they're, they're for Congress and the Administration-for the elected parts of the government to deal with. And they're really consigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this: It's essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they're due. A failure to do that would be unprecedented. We'd be in uncharted territory, and the-and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite a[d]verse. So I'll just leave it there. We, we don't give advice to either side. We just would point out that it-that it's very important that this be done. And the, the other point I'll make about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. We, we-it's, it would be so uncertain that it's just as important that, that this-we never get to a place where we're actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government's not paying its bills. RACHEL SIEGEL. And just a follow-up. Was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff-did that affect today's monetary policy decision at all? CHAIR POWELL. I wouldn't say that it did. It was-of course, it's something that came up. We talk a lot about risks to the-to the outlook, and that will-that come up. A number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn't say that it was important in today's monetary policy decision. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, can you-oh, thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks? And can you tell me what supervisory actions you've done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk? And kind of part 3, but it's all the same question here-do, do you still think this separation principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the February 14 presentation-I didn't remember it very well. But now, of course, I've gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And what it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole Board-the entire Board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you know, the amount of losses they-or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio. There was nothing in it about-that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run. So it was-I think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a-an assessment, a vertical-sorry, horizontal assessment of, of banks. It wasn't-it, it wasn't presented as an urgent or alarming situation. It was presented as a-as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing. And I thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it. In terms of what we're doing-of course, I think banks themselves are, are-many, many banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the events of, of early March, to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. I-you know, like so many things, it, it's very useful. But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits. I mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict. They're both-they're working well together. We've used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And, at the same time, we've been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be argumentative, but the, the staff report said, ""SVB . . . has significant interest rate risk."" It said, ""Interest rate risk measurement[s] . . . failed"" at SVB. And it said, ""Banks with large unrealized losses face significant safety and soundness risks."" Why was that not alarming? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, I didn't say it wasn't alarming. It was-they're pointing out something that they're working on and that they're on the case-that, that, you know, that-I'm not sure whether they mentioned-I think they did, actually. They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter-or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention. So I think that was also in the presentation. I think it was to say: Yes, this is a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this-these things, and we're on the case. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask-obviously, with the recent bank turmoil, we've seen multiple banks buy other banks. And I was just curious whether you think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even larger. CHAIR POWELL. So I, you know, we certainly don't-and I don't have an agenda to further consolidate banks. There's been-consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even-it goes back more than 30 years. You-when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks. Now there are 4,000 and change. So that's, that's going on. I personally have long felt that having small-, medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system. You know, the community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well. So I think it's healthy to have a, you know, an arrange-a range of different kinds of banks doing different things. I think that's a positive thing. Is it a financial-so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely. That, that is their role, so I really don't have a comment on, on that process. As you know, there's an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank. So it was legitimate. And I think the FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid. So I would assume that's what they did. VICTORIA GUIDA. So do you have any concerns about the fact that they're, they're getting larger in general? CHAIR POWELL. So I, I think it's probably good policy that we, we don't want the largest banks doing big acquisitions. That is the policy. And-but this is-this is an exception for a failing bank. And I, I think it's actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also would have-would have been a good-a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought, bought this company. And that could have been the outcome. But, ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost bid. MICHELLE SMITH. Now to Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. At the March meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be equal to one or more rate increases. So, given developments since then, how has your estimate changed? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I think-I think I follow that up by saying, it's, it's quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But, in principle, that's the idea. You know, when we-we've been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit, and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism. And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of broadly similar way. It isn't-it isn't possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we're trying it. But, ultimately, we have to be-we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment. So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates-in principle, we won't have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened. The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don't know how persistent these, these effects will be. We don't know how large they'll be and how long they'll take to be transmitted. But that's, that's what we'll be watching carefully to find out. COLBY SMITH. Just to quickly follow up-what does it suggest about the scope for the Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains strong then, if, if it's having some kind of substitute effect? CHAIR POWELL. It's that-this is just something that we have to factor in as we-as we want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting, and we're going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that-they're listed in, in the statement, the obvious factors. That's, that's the way we're going to be thinking about it. And that's really all we can do. As I say, it does complicate-we, we have, you know, a broad understanding of monetary policy. Credit tightening is a different thing. There's a lot of literature on that. But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let's say-it adds even further uncertainty. Nonetheless, we'll be able to see what's happening with credit conditions-what's happening with lending. We get-there's a lot of data on that. And, you know, we'll, we'll factor that into our decisionmaking. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So, noting that the statement dropped the reference to ""sufficiently"" restricted-""restrictive,"" I was wondering, given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5Â¼ percent is, in fact, sufficiently restrictive. CHAIR POWELL. That's going to be an ongoing assessment. We're going to need data to accumulate on that-not an assessment that we've made, as-that, that would mean we think we've reached that point. And I just think it's, it's not possible to say that with confidence now. But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March meeting showed that in-at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was-this was the appropriate level of the-of the ultimate high level of rates. We don't know that. We'll revisit that at the June meeting. And that's-you know, we're just going to have to-before we really declare that, I think we're going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you know, make that-as I mentioned, it's an ongoing assessment. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. I have a follow-up on credit. Could you give us a sense of what the SLOOS survey indicated? It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were tightening credit as of the, the last survey. What did this one show, and how did that weigh into your deliberations? CHAIR POWELL. So we're going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line with our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we're seeing from other sources. You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have-some of them had been tightening their lending standards. Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the argument around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves. After the bank failures in March, as you've discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year. So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today. Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you've, for the last two meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to keep moving? CHAIR POWELL. Well, we-the reason is that we-again, with our monetary policy we're try-trying to reach and then-and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of policy-a policy stance that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. And, you know, that's what we're trying to do with our-with our tool. I think slowing down was the right move. I, I think it's enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do so. So I, I-you know, we really-you know, we have to balance. We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that. NICK TIMIRAOS. And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to Howard's question-you'll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently restrictive stance. Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six-week intermeeting cycle? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one. You-you know, you can't-with, with economic data, you, you can't-you've, you've seen-take inflation for a minute. Look, look back. We've seen inflation come down-move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We've seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you're going to want to see that-you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you've-that you've got this right, kind of thing. And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We've raised 500 basis points. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably-that you can calculate them many different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable estimate of, of, let's say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent. So you've got 2 percent real rates. That's meaningfully above what most people would-many people, anyway, would, would assess as, you know, the neutral rate. So policy is tight. And you see that in interest-interest-sensitive activities. And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities. And if you-if you put the-you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that's, that's ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we're, we may not be far off-we're possibly even at-that level. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL. Look-I think we're always going to have 2 percent as our, our target. We're always going to be focusing on getting there. EDWARD LAWRENCE. You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent? CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's-let me just say, that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time. I mean, we-that's, that's not a question that's in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. But, ultimately, we're not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools. We have a, a goal of getting to 2 percent. We think it's going to take some time. We don't think it'll be a smooth process. And, you know, I think we're going to-we're going to need to stay at this for a while. EDWARD LAWRENCE. How does the other side of the mandate-the jobs side-once you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance? CHAIR POWELL. I think they, they-you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point. Right now, you have a labor market that's still extraordinarily tight. You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person. We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions. But, overall, you're near a 50 year low in unemployment. Wages-you all will have seen that the wage number from late last week, and it's-whenever it was. And, you know, it's, it's a couple of percentage points above what would be-what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So we do see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments. But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high-well above our-well above our goal. And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down. Fortunately, we've been able to do that so far without unemployment going up. MICHELLE SMITH. Matt. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News. So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed officials' projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates. And so I'm just wondering if you could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you're optimistic that a recession can be avoided, given that that's the Fed staff's forecast-possibly also the broader Committee's forecast as well-and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters'. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I don't think-you know, I know what's printed in the Summary of Economic Projections and all that. I don't think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don't know what they were thinking for first-quarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway, in any case, I'll just say, I, I continue to think that it's possible that this time is really different. And the reason is, there's just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market. It's, it's interesting, as, you know, we've raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3Â½ percent, pretty much where it was-even lower than where it was when we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see-by surveys and much, much [other] evidence-that, that conditions are cooling gradually. But it's-it really is different. You know, it wasn't supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of the-as they've declined without unemployment going up. Well, that's what we've seen. So we-there are no promises in this. But it just seems that, to me, that it's possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I, I fully appreciate that. That would be against the, the pattern. But I do think that it-that this, that the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually-wages have been moving down. Wage increases have been moving down, and that's a good sign-down to a more sustainable level. So I think that-I think it's still possible. I-you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession. But it's not-it's not that the case of having a recession is-I don't rule that out, either. It's, it's possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession. MATTHEW BOESLER. The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation. Do you see that as well? And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we look at a range of wage, wage measures. And then that's in nominal. And then-so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation. And so you can-you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour-basically, those four and many others. And you can-you can look at, at what the-what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation. They can deviate. You know, corporate margins can go up and down. And there is a feature of long expansions where they do go down-where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a recession-sorry, later in an expansion. So, yeah. The, the-you know, and we calculate those, and you have to take the precision with a degree of-a degree of salt. But I would say that what they will show is that, you know, if, if the-if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer to where they need to be. Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get-to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. I-by the way, I don't want to-I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You're asking me a very specific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together. And it's very hard to say what's causing what. But, you know, I've never said that, you know, that-that wages are really the principal driver, because I don't think that's really right. CHRIS RUGABER. Great. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Well, you mentioned profit margins. Those have expanded-did expand sharply during this inflationary period. And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven't fallen as much as might be expected, given that we're seeing at least some pullback among consumer spending. So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months? CHAIR POWELL. So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply. And we've been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or, or not flexible enough. And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices. So to get, I, I think-as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we don't have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing-I think you will see inflation come down. And you'll see-you'll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition, where there's enough supply to meet demand. And then it's-then it's, then you're really back to full competition. That's-that would be the dynamic I would expect. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television. Can you tell us something about what your policy reaction function is-your policy framework is going forward? When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data, which is, by definition, backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is going to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in? CHAIR POWELL. I didn't catch the last part. Rolling? MICHAEL MCKEE. Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year. Do you rule that out? CHAIR POWELL. Oh, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, I got it. So, what are we looking at? I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is to-is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we're always, always looking at both. You know, and it will-of course, it'll be the obvious things. It'll be readings on inflation. It'll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things. I think a particular focus for us going-now, over the past six, seven weeks now and going forward is going to be, what's happening with credit tightening? Are small and medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on lending? And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy. That'll, that'll be an important thing. I just-you know, we'll be looking at everything. It's-again, I would just point out, we've raised rates by 5 percentage points. We are shrinking the balance sheet. And now we have credit conditions tightening-not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more, due to what's happened. And we have to factor all of that in and, and make our assessment of-you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive. And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags. So this is challenging. But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that's what we think. MICHAEL MCKEE. What about the idea of rate cuts? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we on the Committee have a-have a view that inflation is going to come down-not so quickly, but it'll take some time. And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and-to cut rates, and we won't cut rates. If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets-or have been, from time to time, pricing in, you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we'd, we'd factor that in. But that's not our forecast. And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down. Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn't moved much. And it's quite stable. And, you know, so we think we'll have to-demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there. And, again, in that world, it wouldn't be-it wouldn't be appropriate for us to cut rates. MICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay. COURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. I'm curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress. Do you think it's contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to compete with banks for deposits? And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. And, you know, the-it's, it's really not contributing, we don't think, now. It hasn't actually been growing. You know, it moved up-moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the-when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now-what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that. Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual-as they do in every tightening cycle, they've been gradually moving their deposits into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds. So that's a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle. What was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that. But it doesn't seem to have had any-any effect overall on the overnight repo facility. That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they're supposed to be, and it's, it's serving that purpose very well. MICHELLE SMITH. Sarah. SARAH EWALL-WICE. Sarah Ewall-Wice, CBS News. I want to go back to the debt ceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets, and borrowing? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I would just say, it's -I, I don't really think we should be-we shouldn't even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn't pay its bills. It just-it just shouldn't be a thing. And, and again, I would just say, we don't-no one should assume that the Fed can do-can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict. MICHELLE SMITH. Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley for NPR. In his report last week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the regulatory-or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019. Do you share that view, and what would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be necessary? CHAIR POWELL. So I, I didn't-I didn't take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do-I have read it, of course. And I find it persuasive. I mean, I would say it this way: A, a very large-a large bank, not a very large bank-a large bank failed quite suddenly and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system. I think the only thing that, that I'm really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is-may, it may just have been technology evolving. You know, we have to keep up with all that. But some of it may be our policies, and-supervisory and regulatory, whatever. What our job is now is, identify those things and implement them. And that's kind of the only thing I care about is-and I think-I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Evan. EVAN RYSER. Thank you. Evan Ryser with MNI Market News. Chair Powell, are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks? And, secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would-I guess I would say it this way. There were three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we-that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic kind of draws a line under that period of-is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of, of severe stress. Okay. I also think we are very focused on what's happening with credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the-in the Beige Book, and you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium-medium-sized, small and medium-sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards-build liquidity. What's going to be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully monitor what's going on in the banking system, and we'll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way, going forward. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Greg. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Fed Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just wondered if you've done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last-since you've been Fed Chairman, I think I've heard you say a couple of times that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision. Do you think that was the right way to go about this? And, yeah, comments on that. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me say, first of all, I've been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we've learned some new things as well, and we need to do better. And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was unflinching and appropriately so. I welcome it. And I agree with and will support those recommendations. And I do feel that I'm personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems. So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know, the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations-""develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution . . . companies . . . , and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms."" So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for someone else on the Board-not, not the Chair-as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors. Congress wanted that person to be-to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it works-the way it has worked in practice for me is, I've had a good working relationship. I give my, my counsel, my input privately, and that's-I offer that. And I have good conversations, and I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor. And I think that's the way it's supposed to work, and that's appropriate. I, I believe that's what the law requires. And, you know-but, but it isn't-I wouldn't say it's a matter of complete deference. It's more, I have a-I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing-having an intelligent discussion about what's going on and why. And, you know, that's, that's my input. But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision. GREG ROBB. Just wondered if you have any regrets? Or was there anything that, you know-decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what's happened? CHAIR POWELL. I've had a few, sure. I mean, you know, who doesn't look back and think that you could have done things differently? But, honestly, you don't-you don't get to do that. Again, my focus is on what-control the controllable. As one of my great mentors used to always say, ""Control the controllable."" What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them. And, and I think that, that Vice Chair Barr's report is an excellent first step in that, but we've got to follow through. MEGAN CASSELLA. Hi, there. Megan Cassella with Barron's. Did the possibility of pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered? I'm curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed. CHAIR POWELL. So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board. I would say there are a number of people-and, you know, you'll see this in the minutes. I don't want to try to do the head count in real time. But people did talk about pausing, but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we're-I mean, there's a sense that we're, we're-that, you know, we're much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that-you know, as I mentioned, if you-if you add up all the tightening that's going on through various channels, it's-we, we feel like we-you know, we're getting close or, or maybe even there. But that, again, that's going to be an ongoing assessment. And, and we're going to be looking at those factors that we listed and-to determine whether there's, there's more to do. MEGAN CASSELLA. I'm curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the statement. Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again? CHAIR POWELL. I don't want to-I couldn't-I couldn't really say. I just think we're-I think we-look, I think we've moved a long way fairly quickly. And I think we can afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment. MICHELLE SMITH. And we'll go to Nancy for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. You mentioned a few times about the lessons you've learned from the banking crisis-that you would learn the right lessons. What are those lessons? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I just would start with something that's changed, really, which is this-the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history. And that now needs to be reflected in some-in some way in regulation and in supervision. It-we know-now that we know it's possible, I think we didn't-no one thought that was possible. No one-I'm not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so-quite so quickly. So I think that, you know, that will play through. I, I, you know-it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think-I think that's one thing. I, I guess I would just say that. Then, you know-that we're going to-obviously, we're going to revisit [this]. It's pretty clear we need-to me, anyways-clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size. And I'm, I'm thinking that we're on the-on track to do that as well. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Can you be any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. That's-see, that's, that's what Vice Chair Barr's role really is, and he'll take the lead on that. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. Thanks for taking our questions. I wonder if you could tell us whether we should read the statement today as a suggestion that the Committee is prepared to pause interest rate increases in June. And I also wonder if the Fed staff has in any way revised their forecast for a mild recession from the March minutes and, if so, what a recession like what they're envisioning would look and feel like when it comes to, for example, the unemployment rate. CHAIR POWELL. So, taking your question-of course, today our decision was to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. A, a decision on a pause was not made today. You will have noticed that in the-in the statement from March, we had a sentence that said the Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate. That sentence is, is not in, in the statement anymore. We took that out, and instead we're saying that, in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account certain factors. So we-that's a-that's a meaningful change that we're no longer saying that we anticipate. And so we'll be driven by incoming data meeting by meeting. And, you know, we'll approach that question at the June meeting. So the-the staff's forecast is-so let me say-start by saying that that's not my own most likely case, which is really that, that the economy will continue to grow at, at a modest rate this year. And I think that's-so different people on the Committee have different forecasts. That's, that's my own assessment of the most likely path. [The] staff produces its own forecast, and it's independent of the forecasts of, of the participants, which include the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents, of course. And we think this is a healthy thing-that the, the staff is writing down what they really think. They're not especially influenced by what the Governors think, and vice versa. The Governors are not taking what the staff says and just writing that down. So it's actually good that the, the staff and individual participants can have different perspectives. So, broadly, the forecast was for a mild recession, and by that I would characterize as one in which the rise in unemployment is smaller than is-has been typical in modern-era recessions. I wouldn't want to characterize the staff's forecast for this meeting. We'll, we'll leave that to the minutes-but broadly, broadly similar to that. MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Thank you, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. I'm wondering if you can talk about the account of possible effects of a debt-limit standoff. You've said repeatedly that the ceiling must be raised, but do you see any economics effects of even getting close to a default? And what type of situation would that look like? CHAIR POWELL. So I wouldn't want to speculate specifically, but I will say this: These are fiscal policy matters, for starters, and they're, they're for Congress and the Administration-for the elected parts of the government to deal with. And they're really consigned to them. From our standpoint, I would just say this: It's essential that the debt ceiling be raised in a timely way, so that the U.S. government can pay all of its bills when they're due. A failure to do that would be unprecedented. We'd be in uncharted territory, and the-and the consequences to the U.S. economy would be highly uncertain and could, could be quite a[d]verse. So I'll just leave it there. We, we don't give advice to either side. We just would point out that it-that it's very important that this be done. And the, the other point I'll make about that, though, is that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the potential, you know, short- and long-term effects of a failure to pay our bills on time. We, we-it's, it would be so uncertain that it's just as important that, that this-we never get to a place where we're actually talking about or even having a situation where the U.S. government's not paying its bills. RACHEL SIEGEL. And just a follow-up. Was discussion around the uncertainty of a possible standoff-did that affect today's monetary policy decision at all? CHAIR POWELL. I wouldn't say that it did. It was-of course, it's something that came up. We talk a lot about risks to the-to the outlook, and that will-that come up. A number of people did raise that as a risk to the outlook. I wouldn't say that it was important in today's monetary policy decision. MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, can you-oh, thank you. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Can you tell us what the Federal Reserve Board did in the wake of that February presentation where you were informed that Silicon Valley Bank and other banks were experiencing interest rate risks? And can you tell me what supervisory actions you've done in the wake of the recent bank failures to make sure that banks are currently appropriately managing interest rate risk? And kind of part 3, but it's all the same question here-do, do you still think this separation principle that monetary policy and supervision can be handled with different tools? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So the February 14 presentation-I didn't remember it very well. But now, of course, I've gone back and looked at it very carefully. I did remember it. And what it was was a general presentation. It was an informational briefing of the whole Board-the entire Board. I think all members were there. And it was about interest rate risk in the banks and, and lots of data. And there was one page on Silicon Valley Bank, which talked about, you know, the amount of losses they-or mark-to-market losses they had in their portfolio. There was nothing in it about-that I recall, anyway, about, about the risk of a bank run. So it was-I think the takeaway was, they were going away to do a-an assessment, a vertical-sorry, horizontal assessment of, of banks. It wasn't-it, it wasn't presented as an urgent or alarming situation. It was presented as a-as an informational, nondecisional kind of a thing. And I thought it was a good presentation and, and, as I said, did remember it. In terms of what we're doing-of course, I think banks themselves are, are-many, many banks are now, are attending to liquidity and taking opportunity now, really, since, since the events of, of early March, to build liquidity. And you asked about the separation principle. I-you know, like so many things, it, it's very useful. But, you know, ultimately, it has its limits. I mean, I, I think in this particular case, we have found that the monetary policy tools and the financial stability tools are not in conflict. They're both-they're working well together. We've used our, our financial stability tools to support banks through our lending facilities. And, at the same time, we've been able to use our monetary policy tools to foster maximum employment and price stability. STEVE LIESMAN. Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be argumentative, but the, the staff report said, ""SVB . . . has significant interest rate risk."" It said, ""Interest rate risk measurement[s] . . . failed"" at SVB. And it said, ""Banks with large unrealized losses face significant safety and soundness risks."" Why was that not alarming? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I mean, I didn't say it wasn't alarming. It was-they're pointing out something that they're working on and that they're on the case-that, that, you know, that-I'm not sure whether they mentioned-I think they did, actually. They mentioned that they had taken regulatory action matter-or supervisory action in the form of matters requiring attention. So I think that was also in the presentation. I think it was to say: Yes, this is a bank, and there are many other banks that are experiencing this-these things, and we're on the case. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask-obviously, with the recent bank turmoil, we've seen multiple banks buy other banks. And I was just curious whether you think that further consolidation in the banking sector would increase or decrease financial stability and whether you have any concerns about the biggest bank in the U.S. getting even larger. CHAIR POWELL. So I, you know, we certainly don't-and I don't have an agenda to further consolidate banks. There's been-consolidation has been a factor in the U.S. banking industry really since interstate banking and before that even-it goes back more than 30 years. You-when I was in the government a while back, I think there were 14,000 banks. Now there are 4,000 and change. So that's, that's going on. I personally have long felt that having small-, medium-, and large-size banks is a, a great part of our banking system. You know, the community banks serve particular customers very well; regional banks serve very important purposes, and the various kinds of G-SIBs do as well. So I think it's healthy to have a, you know, an arrange-a range of different kinds of banks doing different things. I think that's a positive thing. Is it a financial-so I would just say, in terms of J.P. Morgan buying First Republic, the FDIC really runs the process of closing and selling a closed bank completely. That, that is their role, so I really don't have a comment on, on that process. As you know, there's an exception to the deposit cap for a failing bank. So it was legitimate. And I think the FDIC, I believe, is bound by law to take the bid that is the least-cost bid. So I would assume that's what they did. VICTORIA GUIDA. So do you have any concerns about the fact that they're, they're getting larger in general? CHAIR POWELL. So I, I think it's probably good policy that we, we don't want the largest banks doing big acquisitions. That is the policy. And-but this is-this is an exception for a failing bank. And I, I think it's actually a good outcome for the banking system. It also would have-would have been a good-a good outcome for the banking system had one of the regional banks bought, bought this company. And that could have been the outcome. But, ultimately, we have to follow the law in our agencies, and the law is, it goes to the, the least-cost bid. MICHELLE SMITH. Now to Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. At the March meeting, you mentioned that tightening of credit conditions from the recent bank stress could be equal to one or more rate increases. So, given developments since then, how has your estimate changed? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I think-I think I follow that up by saying, it's, it's quite impossible to have a precise estimate of the words to that effect. But, in principle, that's the idea. You know, when we-we've been raising interest rates, and that raises the price of credit, and that, in a sense, restricts credit in the economy, working through the price mechanism. And, you know, when banks raise their credit standards, that can also make credit tighter in a kind of broadly similar way. It isn't-it isn't possible to make a kind of clean translation between one and the other, although firms are trying that and, you know, we're trying it. But, ultimately, we have to be-we have to be honest and humble about our ability to make a precise assessment. So it does complicate the task of achieving, you know, a sufficiently restrictive stance. But I think, conceptually, though, we think that, you know, interest rates-in principle, we won't have to raise the rates quite as high as we would have had this not happened. The extent of that is so hard to predict because we don't know how persistent these, these effects will be. We don't know how large they'll be and how long they'll take to be transmitted. But that's, that's what we'll be watching carefully to find out. COLBY SMITH. Just to quickly follow up-what does it suggest about the scope for the Committee to pause rate increases perhaps as early as next month, even if the data remains strong then, if, if it's having some kind of substitute effect? CHAIR POWELL. It's that-this is just something that we have to factor in as we-as we want to find ourselves. So I guess I would say it this way: The assessment of, of the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate is going to be an ongoing one, meeting by meeting, and we're going to be looking at the factors that I mentioned that-they're listed in, in the statement, the obvious factors. That's, that's the way we're going to be thinking about it. And that's really all we can do. As I say, it does complicate-we, we have, you know, a broad understanding of monetary policy. Credit tightening is a different thing. There's a lot of literature on that. But translating it into, into rate hikes is uncertain, let's say-it adds even further uncertainty. Nonetheless, we'll be able to see what's happening with credit conditions-what's happening with lending. We get-there's a lot of data on that. And, you know, we'll, we'll factor that into our decisionmaking. MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So, noting that the statement dropped the reference to ""sufficiently"" restricted-""restrictive,"" I was wondering, given your baseline outlook, whether you feel this current rate of 5 to 5Â¼ percent is, in fact, sufficiently restrictive. CHAIR POWELL. That's going to be an ongoing assessment. We're going to need data to accumulate on that-not an assessment that we've made, as-that, that would mean we think we've reached that point. And I just think it's, it's not possible to say that with confidence now. But, nonetheless, you, you will know that the Summary of Economic Projections from the March meeting showed that in-at that point in time, that the median participant thought that this was-this was the appropriate level of the-of the ultimate high level of rates. We don't know that. We'll revisit that at the June meeting. And that's-you know, we're just going to have to-before we really declare that, I think we're going to have to see data accumulating and, and, you know, make that-as I mentioned, it's an ongoing assessment. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. I have a follow-up on credit. Could you give us a sense of what the SLOOS survey indicated? It was already, I think, 40, 45 percent of banks were tightening credit as of the, the last survey. What did this one show, and how did that weigh into your deliberations? CHAIR POWELL. So we're going to release the results of this SLOOS on May 8, in line with our usual time frame. And I would just say that the SLOOS is broadly consistent, when you see it, with how we and others have been thinking about the situation and what we're seeing from other sources. You will have seen the Beige Book and listened to the various earnings calls that indicate that midsize banks have-some of them had been tightening their lending standards. Banking data will show that lending has continued to grow, but the pace has been slowing really since the second half of last year. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, the argument around the end of last year and the beginning of this year to slow down the pace of increases was to give yourself time to study the effects of those moves. After the bank failures in March, as you've discussed, the Fed staff projected a recession starting later this year. So my question is why it was necessary to raise interest rates today. Or, put, put differently: If the whole point of slowing down the pace was to see the effects of your moves, and now you've, for the last two meetings, been seeing the effects of those moves, why did the Committee feel it was necessary to keep moving? CHAIR POWELL. Well, we-the reason is that we-again, with our monetary policy we're try-trying to reach and then-and then stay at a, for an extended period, a level of policy-a policy stance that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. And, you know, that's what we're trying to do with our-with our tool. I think slowing down was the right move. I, I think it's enabled us to see more data, and it will continue to do so. So I, I-you know, we really-you know, we have to balance. We always have to balance the risk of not doing enough and, and not getting inflation under control against the risk of maybe slowing down economic activity too much. And we thought that this rate hike, along with the meaningful change in, in our policy statement, was the right way to balance that. NICK TIMIRAOS. And just to follow up, you know, what you said in response to Howard's question-you'll need data to accumulate to determine if this is a sufficiently restrictive stance. Does that data need to accumulate, or could it accumulate over a longer period than a six-week intermeeting cycle? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I mean, as I mentioned, I would just say that this assessment will be an ongoing one. You-you know, you can't-with, with economic data, you, you can't-you've, you've seen-take inflation for a minute. Look, look back. We've seen inflation come down-move back up two or three times since March of 2021. We've seen inflation have a few months of coming down and then come right back up. So I think you're going to want to see that-you know, that a few months of data will, will persuade you that you've-that you've got this right, kind of thing. And, you know, we, we have the luxury: We've raised 500 basis points. I think that policy is tight. I think real rates are probably-that you can calculate them many different ways. But one way is to look at the nominal rate and then subtract a, a reasonable estimate of, of, let's say, one-year inflation, which might be 3 percent. So you've got 2 percent real rates. That's meaningfully above what most people would-many people, anyway, would, would assess as, you know, the neutral rate. So policy is tight. And you see that in interest-interest-sensitive activities. And you also begin to see it more and more in, in other activities. And if you-if you put the-you put the credit tightening on top of that and the QT that's, that's ongoing, I think, I think you feel like, you know, we're, we may not be far off-we're possibly even at-that level. MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you very much, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So if the Federal Reserve gets down to the 3 percent inflation, as the projections show, at the end of this year or close to it, would it be okay for you for a prolonged period of 3 percent inflation and hoping for some outside event to move down to 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL. Look-I think we're always going to have 2 percent as our, our target. We're always going to be focusing on getting there. EDWARD LAWRENCE. You would be okay with a prolonged 3 percent? CHAIR POWELL. You know, it's-let me just say, that's not what we're looking for. We're looking for inflation going down to 2 percent over time. I mean, we-that's, that's not a question that's in front of us, and it would depend on so many other things. But, ultimately, we're not looking to get to 3 percent and then drop our tools. We have a, a goal of getting to 2 percent. We think it's going to take some time. We don't think it'll be a smooth process. And, you know, I think we're going to-we're going to need to stay at this for a while. EDWARD LAWRENCE. How does the other side of the mandate-the jobs side-once you get to 3 percent, going from 3 to 2, how does the other side of the mandate balance? CHAIR POWELL. I think they, they-you know, they, they will both matter equally at that point. Right now, you have a labor market that's still extraordinarily tight. You still got 1.6 job openings, even with the lower job openings number, for every unemployed person. We do see some evidence of softening in labor market conditions. But, overall, you're near a 50 year low in unemployment. Wages-you all will have seen that the wage number from late last week, and it's-whenever it was. And, you know, it's, it's a couple of percentage points above what would be-what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. So we do see some softening; we see new labor supply coming in. These are very positive developments. But the labor market is very, very strong, whereas inflation is, you know, running high-well above our-well above our goal. And right now, we need to be focusing on bringing inflation down. Fortunately, we've been able to do that so far without unemployment going up. MICHELLE SMITH. Matt. MATTHEW BOESLER. Hi, Chair Powell. Matthew Boesler with Bloomberg News. So, many analysts noted at the time of the March FOMC meeting that at least half of Fed officials' projections did imply or seemed to imply that a recession was in their baseline forecast as well, given the strong first-quarter GDP tracking estimates. And so I'm just wondering if you could kind of elaborate on, you know, why you're optimistic that a recession can be avoided, given that that's the Fed staff's forecast-possibly also the broader Committee's forecast as well-and, and also, of course, most private-sector forecasters'. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I don't think-you know, I know what's printed in the Summary of Economic Projections and all that. I don't think you can deduce exactly what you said about what participants think, because you don't know what they were thinking for first-quarter GDP at that point. They could have been thinking about a fairly low number. Anyway, in any case, I'll just say, I, I continue to think that it's possible that this time is really different. And the reason is, there's just so much excess demand, really, in the labor market. It's, it's interesting, as, you know, we've raised rates by 5 percentage points in 14 months, and the unemployment rate is 3Â½ percent, pretty much where it was-even lower than where it was when we started. So job openings are still very, very high. We see-by surveys and much, much [other] evidence-that, that conditions are cooling gradually. But it's-it really is different. You know, it wasn't supposed to be possible for job openings to decline by as much of the-as they've declined without unemployment going up. Well, that's what we've seen. So we-there are no promises in this. But it just seems that, to me, that it's possible that we can continue to have a cooling in the labor market without having the big increases in unemployment that have gone with many, you know, prior episodes. Now, that would be against history. I, I fully appreciate that. That would be against the, the pattern. But I do think that it-that this, that the situation in the labor market, with so much excess demand, yet, you know, wages are actually-wages have been moving down. Wage increases have been moving down, and that's a good sign-down to a more sustainable level. So I think that-I think it's still possible. I-you know, I think, you know, the, the case of, of avoiding a recession is, in my view, more likely than that of having, having a recession. But it's not-it's not that the case of having a recession is-I don't rule that out, either. It's, it's possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession. MATTHEW BOESLER. The Committee also noted in March that wage growth was still well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation. Do you see that as well? And could you kind of explain, you know, how you come to that judgment? CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we look at a range of wage, wage measures. And then that's in nominal. And then-so you assume wages should be equal to productivity increases plus inflation. And so you can-you can look at, you know, the employment compensation index, average hourly earnings, the Atlanta wage tracker, compensation per hour-basically, those four and many others. And you can-you can look at, at what the-what they would have to run at over a long period of time for that to be consistent with 2 percent inflation. They can deviate. You know, corporate margins can go up and down. And there is a feature of long expansions where they do go down-where labor gets a bigger share toward later, later in a recession-sorry, later in an expansion. So, yeah. The, the-you know, and we calculate those, and you have to take the precision with a degree of-a degree of salt. But I would say that what they will show is that, you know, if, if the-if wages are running at 5 percent, 3 percent is closer to where they need to be. Wage increases and closer to 3 percent, roughly, is what it would take to get-to be consistent with inflation over a longer period of time. I-by the way, I don't want to-I do not think that wages are the principal driver of inflation. You're asking me a very specific question. I think there are many things. I think wages and prices tend to move together. And it's very hard to say what's causing what. But, you know, I've never said that, you know, that-that wages are really the principal driver, because I don't think that's really right. CHRIS RUGABER. Great. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. Well, you mentioned profit margins. Those have expanded-did expand sharply during this inflationary period. And while there are some signs that they are starting to decline, many economists note they haven't fallen as much as might be expected, given that we're seeing at least some pullback among consumer spending. So, speaking of causes of inflation, do you see expanded profit margins as a driver of higher prices? And if so, would you expect them to narrow soon and, and contribute to reduced inflation in the coming months? CHAIR POWELL. So higher profits and higher margins are what happens when you have an imbalance between supply and demand: too much demand, not enough supply. And we've been in a situation in many parts of the economy where, where supply has been fixed or, or not flexible enough. And so, you know, the way the market clears is through higher prices. So to get, I, I think-as goods pipelines have, have gotten, you know, back to normal so that we don't have the long waits and the shortages and that kind of thing-I think you will see inflation come down. And you'll see-you'll see corporate margins coming down as a result of return of full competition, where there's enough supply to meet demand. And then it's-then it's, then you're really back to full competition. That's-that would be the dynamic I would expect. MICHELLE SMITH. Michael. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee for Bloomberg Radio and Television. Can you tell us something about what your policy reaction function is-your policy framework is going forward? When you look at the economy at the next meeting, are you looking at incoming data, which is, by definition, backward looking? Are you going to be forecasting what you think is going to happen? Are you ruling out the rate cuts that the market has priced in? CHAIR POWELL. I didn't catch the last part. Rolling? MICHAEL MCKEE. Markets have priced in rate cuts by the end of the year. Do you rule that out? CHAIR POWELL. Oh, yes. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, I got it. So, what are we looking at? I mean, we look at a combination of data and, and forecasts. Of course, the whole idea is to-is to create a good forecast based on what you see in the data. So we're always, always looking at both. You know, and it will-of course, it'll be the obvious things. It'll be readings on inflation. It'll be readings on wages, on economic growth, on the labor market, and all of those many things. I think a particular focus for us going-now, over the past six, seven weeks now and going forward is going to be, what's happening with credit tightening? Are small and medium-sized banks tightening credit standards, and, and is that having an effect on, on loans, on lending? And, you know, so we can begin to assess how that fits in with monetary policy. That'll, that'll be an important thing. I just-you know, we'll be looking at everything. It's-again, I would just point out, we've raised rates by 5 percentage points. We are shrinking the balance sheet. And now we have credit conditions tightening-not just in the normal way, but perhaps a little bit more, due to what's happened. And we have to factor all of that in and, and make our assessment of-you know, of whether our policy stance is sufficiently restrictive. And we have to do that in a world where policy works with long and variable lags. So this is challenging. But, you know, we, we will make our best assessment, and that's what we think. MICHAEL MCKEE. What about the idea of rate cuts? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So we on the Committee have a-have a view that inflation is going to come down-not so quickly, but it'll take some time. And in that world, if that forecast is broadly right, it would not be appropriate and-to cut rates, and we won't cut rates. If you have a different forecast and, you know, markets-or have been, from time to time, pricing in, you know, quite rapid reductions in inflation, you know, we'd, we'd factor that in. But that's not our forecast. And, of course, the history of the last two years has been very much that inflation moves down. Particularly now, if you look at nonhousing services, it really, really hasn't moved much. And it's quite stable. And, you know, so we think we'll have to-demand will have to weaken a little bit, and labor market conditions, conditions may have to soften a bit more to begin to see progress there. And, again, in that world, it wouldn't be-it wouldn't be appropriate for us to cut rates. MICHELLE SMITH. Courtenay. COURTENAY BROWN. Courtenay Brown from Axios. I'm curious how you view the role of the overnight reverse repo facility in the context of the current banking stress. Do you think it's contributing to the stress by making it more attractive for money market funds to compete with banks for deposits? And did the Committee discuss any changes to the structure of the facility? Or do you see that being put on the table in the future? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So we looked at that very carefully, as you would imagine. And, you know, the-it's, it's really not contributing, we don't think, now. It hasn't actually been growing. You know, it moved up-moved down and then moved back up to where it was. What happened in the-when, when there were the big deposit flows, which, by the way, have really stabilized now-what happened was, institutional investors took their uninsured deposits and put them in government money market funds, which bought paper from the Federal Home Loan Banks and things like that. Over the course of, of maybe the last year, retail investors had been gradual-as they do in every tightening cycle, they've been gradually moving their deposits into higher-yielding places such as CDs and, and other things, including money market funds. So that's a gradual process that is quite natural and happens during a, a tightening cycle. What was unusual, really, was the institutional investors moving their uninsured deposits and spreading them around and things like that. But it doesn't seem to have had any-any effect overall on the overnight repo facility. That is really there to, to help us keep rates where they're supposed to be, and it's, it's serving that purpose very well. MICHELLE SMITH. Sarah. SARAH EWALL-WICE. Sarah Ewall-Wice, CBS News. I want to go back to the debt ceiling for a moment. I know you talked about that in terms of fiscal policy, but can you just speak towards what the impact of a default would mean for Americans across the country, the markets, and borrowing? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. I would just say, it's -I, I don't really think we should be-we shouldn't even be talking about a world in which the U.S. doesn't pay its bills. It just-it just shouldn't be a thing. And, and again, I would just say, we don't-no one should assume that the Fed can do-can really protect the economy and the financial system and our reputation globally from, from the damage that such, such an event might inflict. MICHELLE SMITH. Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley for NPR. In his report last week, Vice Chair Barr identified a couple of the factors that he thought contributed to the regulatory-or the supervisory lapses at Silicon Valley Bank: a policy change in 2019 to exempt all but the biggest banks from strict scrutiny and also what he called a sort of cultural shift towards less aggressive oversight. You were here in 2019. Do you share that view, and what would it take to get the, the stronger oversight that you and he said in your release would be necessary? CHAIR POWELL. So I, I didn't-I didn't take part in creating the report or doing the work, but I do-I have read it, of course. And I find it persuasive. I mean, I would say it this way: A, a very large-a large bank, not a very large bank-a large bank failed quite suddenly and unexpectedly in a way that threatened to spread contagion into the financial system. I think the only thing that, that I'm really focused on is to understand what went wrong, what happened, and, and identify what we need to do to address that. Some of that is-may, it may just have been technology evolving. You know, we have to keep up with all that. But some of it may be our policies, and-supervisory and regulatory, whatever. What our job is now is, identify those things and implement them. And that's kind of the only thing I care about is-and I think-I feel like I am accountable for doing everything I can to make sure that that happens. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Evan. EVAN RYSER. Thank you. Evan Ryser with MNI Market News. Chair Powell, are we in the early stage or nearing the end stage of the banking turmoil among regional banks? And, secondly, do you still have a bias to tighten rates? Is that what the statement is saying? CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would-I guess I would say it this way. There were three large banks, really, from the very beginning that were at the heart of the stress that we-that we saw in early March, the severe period of stress. Those have now all been resolved, and all the depositors have been protected. I think that the resolution and sale of, of First Republic kind of draws a line under that period of-is an important step toward drawing a line under that period of, of severe stress. Okay. I also think we are very focused on what's happening with credit availability, particularly, you know, with what you saw in the-in the Beige Book, and you will see in the SLOOS, is, is small and medium-medium-sized, small and medium-sized banks who are feeling that they need to tighten credit standards-build liquidity. What's going to be the macroeconomic effect of that? More broadly, we, we will continue to very carefully monitor what's going on in the banking system, and we'll factor that assessment into our decisions in an important way, going forward. MICHELLE SMITH. Okay. Greg. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Fed Chairman. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I just wondered if you've done any reflection on, on your own actions during this crisis and leading up to it over the last-since you've been Fed Chairman, I think I've heard you say a couple of times that you deferred to the Vice Chair for Supervision. Do you think that was the right way to go about this? And, yeah, comments on that. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So let me say, first of all, I've been Chair of the Board for five-plus years now, and I fully recognize that we made mistakes. I think we've learned some new things as well, and we need to do better. And, as I mentioned, I thought the report was unflinching and appropriately so. I welcome it. And I agree with and will support those recommendations. And I do feel that I'm personally accountable to do what I can to foster measures that will address the problems. So, on, on the Vice Chair for Supervision, you know, the place to start is, is the statutory role, which is quite unusual. The Vice Chair, it says, shall deploy policy recommendations-""develop policy recommendations for the Board regarding supervision and regulation of depository institution . . . companies . . . , and shall oversee the supervision and regulation of such firms."" So this is Congress establishing a four-year term for someone else on the Board-not, not the Chair-as Vice Chair for Supervision who really gets to set the agenda for supervision and regulation for the Board of Governors. Congress wanted that person to be-to have political accountability for developing that agenda. So the way it works-the way it has worked in practice for me is, I've had a good working relationship. I give my, my counsel, my input privately, and that's-I offer that. And I have good conversations, and I try to contribute constructively. I respect the authority that Congress has deferred on that person, including working with, with Vice Chair Barr and, and his predecessor. And I think that's the way it's supposed to work, and that's appropriate. I, I believe that's what the law requires. And, you know-but, but it isn't-I wouldn't say it's a matter of complete deference. It's more, I have a-I have a role in, in presenting my views and discussing-having an intelligent discussion about what's going on and why. And, you know, that's, that's my input. But, ultimately, that person does get to set the agenda and gets to take things to the Board of Governors and really, in supervision, has sole authority over supervision. GREG ROBB. Just wondered if you have any regrets? Or was there anything that, you know-decisions that maybe you regret now in light of what's happened? CHAIR POWELL. I've had a few, sure. I mean, you know, who doesn't look back and think that you could have done things differently? But, honestly, you don't-you don't get to do that. Again, my focus is on what-control the controllable. As one of my great mentors used to always say, ""Control the controllable."" What we control now is, make a fair assessment, learn the right lessons, figure out what the fixes are, and implement them. And, and I think that, that Vice Chair Barr's report is an excellent first step in that, but we've got to follow through. MEGAN CASSELLA. Hi, there. Megan Cassella with Barron's. Did the possibility of pausing at this meeting come up at all, and how seriously was that considered? I'm curious if you can give us any color as to whether there were any initial concerns about raising rates again or what those discussions entailed. CHAIR POWELL. So support for the 25 basis point rate increase was very strong across the board. I would say there are a number of people-and, you know, you'll see this in the minutes. I don't want to try to do the head count in real time. But people did talk about pausing, but not so much at this meeting, you know, that we're-I mean, there's a sense that we're, we're-that, you know, we're much closer to the end of this than to the beginning, that-you know, as I mentioned, if you-if you add up all the tightening that's going on through various channels, it's-we, we feel like we-you know, we're getting close or, or maybe even there. But that, again, that's going to be an ongoing assessment. And, and we're going to be looking at those factors that we listed and-to determine whether there's, there's more to do. MEGAN CASSELLA. I'm curious, too, how to interpret that and, and the changes to the statement. Is the bar higher now to raise rates at the next meeting, or would a strong jobs report or inflation print be enough to push the Fed to tighten again? CHAIR POWELL. I don't want to-I couldn't-I couldn't really say. I just think we're-I think we-look, I think we've moved a long way fairly quickly. And I think we can afford to look at the data and, and make a careful assessment. MICHELLE SMITH. And we'll go to Nancy for the last question. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. You mentioned a few times about the lessons you've learned from the banking crisis-that you would learn the right lessons. What are those lessons? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I just would start with something that's changed, really, which is this-the run on Silicon Valley Bank was out of keeping with the speed of runs through history. And that now needs to be reflected in some-in some way in regulation and in supervision. It-we know-now that we know it's possible, I think we didn't-no one thought that was possible. No one-I'm not aware of anybody thinking that this could happen so-quite so quickly. So I think that, you know, that will play through. I, I, you know-it will be up to Vice Chair Barr to really take the lead in designing the ways to address that. But I think-I think that's one thing. I, I guess I would just say that. Then, you know-that we're going to-obviously, we're going to revisit [this]. It's pretty clear we need-to me, anyways-clear that we need to strengthen both supervision and regulations for banks of this size. And I'm, I'm thinking that we're on the-on track to do that as well. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Can you be any more specific on stress testing or looking at banks that have specific concentrations in certain parts of the economy? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. That's-see, that's, that's what Vice Chair Barr's role really is, and he'll take the lead on that. Thank you."

to Colby Smith with the financial times I'm curious what gives you and the committee the confidence that waiting will not be counterproductive at a time when the monthly pace of core inflation is still so elevated interest rate sensitive sectors like housing while they felt the drag of the past fed actions have started to recover in some regions and financial conditions you know most recently we're easing foreign I guess I would go back to the beginning of this tightening cycle to address that so as we started our rate hikes early last year we said there were three issues that would need to be addressed kind of in sequence and that of the speed of tightening the level to which rates would need to go and then in a period of time over which we'd need to keep policy restrictive so at the outset going back to 15 months the key issue was how fast to move rates up and we moved very quickly by historical standards then last December after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes we moderated to a pace of 50 of a 50 basis point hike and then this year to three 25 basis point hikes at sequential meetings so it seemed to us to make obvious sense to moderate our rate hikes as we got closer to our destination so the decision to consider not hiking at every meeting and ultimately to hold rage steady at this meeting I would just say it's a continuation of of that process the main issue that we're focused on now is determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to two percent over time so that the pace of the increases and the ultimate level of increases are separate variables given how far it it we have come it may make sense for rates to move higher but at a more moderate pace I want to stress one more thing and that is that the committee decision made today was only about this meeting we didn't make any decision about uh going forward including what would happen at the next meeting including we did not decide or really discuss anything about going to an every other meeting kind of an approach or really any other approach we really were focused on what to do at this meeting kind of initial initial debate about the possibility of July any sense of the initial support at this stage for that move so again we didn't we didn't make a decision about July I mean of course it came up in the in the in the meeting from time to time but really the focus was on what to do today I would say about about July two things one decision hasn't been made to I do expect that it will be a live meeting power thanks Howard Schneider with Reuters I was just wondering if you could help us understand the narrative here because it feels like there's been a level shift in the in the dots um stronger GDP uh less of a hits on employment slower progress on inflation and I'm wondering in this sort of where's the disinflation coming from sure the labor Market's going to be stronger it looks like it's not coming from there uh demand is not coming down all that fast according to GDP you've doubled your your estimate of GDP so what's the what's the narrative here it seems like it's getting more Immaculate rather than more messy so you're right that the data came in I would say consistent with but on the high side of expectations so and if you go back to the old the former SCP the last SCP in March you will see that growth moved up these are not huge moves but growth estimates moved up a bit unemployment estimates moved down a bit inflation estimates moved up a bit and you know the all three of those kind of point in the same direction which is you know that perhaps more restraint will be necessary than we had thought at the last meeting so although the level frankly is is pretty the level of 5.6 is pretty consistent if you think about it where the federal funds rate was trading before the bank incidents of early March so but so we've kind of gone back to that so your question is where is it where is the disinflation going to come from and you know I don't think the story has really changed we the committee has consistently said and believed that the process of getting inflation down is going to be a gradual one it's going to take some time and uh I think you go back to the to the three-part framework for core pce inflation which is we think of as good an indicators you can have for where inflation is going forward you start with Goods with Goods we need to see continued healing and Supply conditions supply side conditions they've definitely improved a substantial amount but if you talk to people in business they will say it's not back to where it was so that's that's one thing and that should enable Goods prices to continue because because inflation to continue to come down over time in terms of Housing Services inflation that's another big piece and and you are seeing there that new rents new new leases are are coming in at low levels and it's really a matter of time as that goes through the pipeline in fact I think any forecast that people are making right now about inflation coming down this year will will contain a big dose of this year and next year we'll contain a a good amount of of uh disinflation from that source and and that's again probably going to come slower than we would affect that leaves you know the big sector which is a little more than half pardon me of the uh of core PC inflation that's non-housing services and you know we see only the earliest signs of disinflation there it's a sector it's a very Broad and diverse sector I would say in a number of the parts of that sector the largest cost would be wage costs it's the service sector so it's it's heavily labor intensive and I think many analysts would say that the key to getting inflation down there is to have a continuing loosening in labor market conditions which we have seen we have actually seen you know I go through a number of indicators suggesting there's been some losing in labor market conditions we need to see that continue I would almost say that the the conditions that we need to see in place to get inflation down or are coming into place and that would be growing growth meaningfully below Trend it would be a labor market that's loosening it would be good pipelines getting healthier and healthier and that kind of thing but there there the things are in place that we need to see but the process of that actually working on inflation is going to take some time um Nick tamarose of the Wall Street Journal chairpel what's the value in pausing and signaling future hikes versus just hiking now I mean not to be flippant but I don't lose weight just by buying a gym membership I have to actually go to the gym 16 of your colleagues put down a higher year-end 23 rate today a majority of you think you're going to have to go up by 50 basis points this year so why not just rip off the Band-Aid and raise rates today so that at first I would say that the the question of speed is a separate question from the question from the from from that of level okay so um and I think if you look at the SCP that is our estimate our individual is it's really accumulation of our individual estimates of how far to go I I mentioned how how we got to those numbers in terms of speed it's it's what I said at the beginning which is speed was very important last year as we get closer and closer to the destination and according to the SCP we're not so far away from the destination in most people's accounting uh it's it's reasonable it's common sense to go a little slower just as it was reasonable to go from 75 basis points to 50 to 25 at every meeting and so uh the committee thought overall that it was appropriate to moderate the pace if only slightly and their benefits to that so that gives us more information to make decisions we may try to make better decisions I think it allows the economy a little more time to adapt as we as we make our decisions going forward and we'll get to see you know we haven't really we don't know the full extent of of the consequences of the banking turmoil that we've seen we it would be early to see those but we don't know what the extent is we'll have some more time to see that unfolding it's just the idea that we're trying to get this right and uh this is if you think of the two things as separate variables then I think I think that the the skip I shouldn't call it skip the the decision um uh makes sense I know you said July is live with only one June employment uh with only the June employment and the CPI report for June due to be released before the July meeting you get the ECI after you get the senior loan officer survey after you get some Bank earnings at the end of next month what incremental information will the committee be using to inform their judgment on whether this is in fact a skip or a longer pause well I think you're adding that to the the data that we've seen since the last meeting too you know we since we chose to maintain rates at this meeting is it'll really be a three-month period of data that we can look at I think that's a full quarter and I think you can you can draw more conclusions from that than you come from any six any six week period we'll look at those things we'll also look at the evolving risk picture we'll look at what's happening in the financial sector we'll look at all the data the evolving Outlook and we'll make a decision Gina thanks for taking our questions Gina smile like New York Times you obviously in your forecast marked up the sort of path for growth marked down the path for unemployment marked up the path for inflation pretty notably I wonder you know since March what has changed to make you think that the economy is a lot more resilient and inflation is going to be a lot more stubborn and given that you know why do you feel confident that this is as high as you're going to have to revise the federal funds rate or do you think it's possible we could have even a higher than 5.6 terminal by the end of this this cycle you know I I mean on the first part I just think we're following the data and also the Outlook the economy is the labor market I think has surprised many if not all analysts over the last couple of years with its extraordinary resilience really and um it's it's just remarkable and that's really if you think about it that's what's driving it's it's job creation it's it's uh wages moving up it's it's supporting spending which in turn is supporting hiring and it's it's really the engine it seems that is that is driving the economy so it's it's really the data in terms of you know we always write down at these meetings what we think the appropriate terminal rate will be at the end of this year that's that's how we do it um it's based on uh our our own individual assessments of what the most likely path of the economy is it can be it can actually in reality wind up being lower or higher and you know there's really no way to know but it's it's it is it's it's what people think as of today and as the as the data come in it it can move around during the intermediate period It could wind up back in the same place but it really will be data driven I can't I can't tell you that that I ever have a lot of confidence that we can see where the where the federal funds rate will be that far in advance Mr chairman thanks for my question um you had said back at the end of May that you thought risks were getting closer to being into balance is that still the case or has your mind changed about the balance of risks out there and also could you give us an idea of what would be a sufficiently restrictive funds rate is the obviously the current rate according to the committee is not sufficiently restrictive is it five six is it six words for sufficiently restrictive thank you um you know I I would say again that I think that over time the balance of risks as we've moved from very you know from interest rates at effectively zero now to five percentage points with with an SCP calling for additional hikes I think we've moved much closer to our destination which is that sufficiently restrictive rate and I think that means by almost by definition that the the risks of of sort of overdoing it and under underdoing it are are getting closer to being in Balance I still think and my my colleagues agree that that the risks to inflation are to the upside still so we don't we don't think we're there with inflation yet because we're just looking at the data if you look at the uh um at the full range of of inflation data particularly the core data you just you just aren't seeing a lot of progress over the last year headline of course inflation has come down materially but as you know we look at core as a better indicator of where inflation overall is going officially so I think you know what what we'd like to see is credible evidence that inflation is topping out and then beginning to come down that's that's what we want to see of course that's what we want to see and um I I think it's also we understand that there are lags but remember that it's it's more than a year since Financial conditions began tightening I think it's I think the reason we're we're comfortable pausing is that we are still much of the tightening took place over last summer and later into the year and I think it's it's reasonable to think that some of that may come into effect so we're you know I think stretching out the into a more moderate pace is appropriate to to allow you to make that Judgment of sufficiency you know more with more data over time Washington Post thanks for taking your questions I wanted to ask further on the lag effects when you're considering when you would hike again throughout the course of the year are there things that you would expect to kick in as those lag effects come come into effect that would inform your decisions have you learned things over the past year that give you some sense of timeline for when to expect those lags to come into effect so it's a it's a challenging thing in economics it's it's sort of standard thinking that monetary policy affects economic activity with long and variable legs of course these days Financial conditions begin to tighten well in advance of actual rate hikes so if you if you look back when we were lifting off we started talking about lifting off by the time we had lifted off the two-year which is a pretty good estimate of where policy is going had gone from 20 basis points to 200 basis points so in that sense tightening happens much sooner than it used to in a world where where news was in newspapers and not you know not on on The Wire so that's that's different but it's still the case that what you see is intra-sensitive spending is affected very very quickly so housing and durable goods and things like that but broader demand and spending and and asset values and things like that they just take longer and you can pretty much find research to support whatever answer you would like on that so there's not any certainty or agreement in the profession on how long it takes so you know then that makes it challenging of course so we're we're looking at the calendar we're looking at what's happening in the economy we're having to make these judgments and again it's one of the main reasons why it makes sense to go at a slightly more moderate Pace now as we seek that that uh ultimate I can't point to that ultimate endpoint I can't point to a specific data point I think we'll see it when we see inflation you know really really flattening out reliably and then starting to soften I think we'll know that we're that it's worth working and ideally by by taking a little more time we won't go well past the air the level where we need to go I was curious if you could get things since the March and how you're teasing that out apart from these lag effects so it's it's too early still to to try to assess the full extent of what that might mean uh and you know that's something we're going to be watching of course and you know if we were to see what we would view as significant tightening beyond what would normally be expected because of of this channel then you know we would factor that into account on on uh in in making raid decisions so that's um that's how we think about it uh thanks Chris Gaber and Associated Press you mentioned that many of the trends are in place that you want to see uh core Services X housing has come in pretty low in the past couple of months and as you noted a significant portion of core inflation is now housing prices and then we've had some quirks in used car prices so given that these Trends are in place I guess I'm sort of asking the flip side of Nick's question why uh signal additional rate hikes aren't things headed in the direction you need why not simply give it even more time or uh I mean it's surprising to see so much hawkishness in the dots given what we're seeing recently yeah so you know we've remember we've um were two and a half years into this or two and a quarter years into this and forecasters including fed forecasters have consistently thought that inflation was about to turn down and uh you know traditional not you know typically forecasted that it would and been wrong so I think if you I think if you look at the at core pce inflation overall look at it over the last six months you're just not seeing a lot of progress It's running and it's running at a level you know over four and a half percent far above our our Target and not really you know moving down we want to see it moving down decisively that's all we're you know of course we're going to get inflation down to two percent over time we don't want to do we want to do that with the minimum damage we can to the economy of course but we have to get inflation out of two percent and we will and we just don't see that yet so hence you see today's policy decision both to write down for the rate hikes by the end of this year but also to you know to take uh to moderate somewhat the pace with which we're moving a quick follow-up I mean the last press conference you mentioned you didn't see wages driving inflation and you know there was some research from the San Francisco feds suggesting wages aren't necessarily a key driver but you've talked about the labor market today and the need for softening can you give us a little more specifically of how you see the tight labor market driving inflation at this point thank you right so um I'm not going to comment on on any particular paper but I would say that the I think the overall picture is that at the beginning in you know early 2021 inflation was really becoming from very strong demand for largely for goods people were still at home they had money in the bank and they wanted to spend they spent a lot on goods and of course at the same time and because of that high demand to some extent Supply chains got all snarled up so prices went way up inflation went way up that was the the origin it wasn't really particularly about the labor market or wages but as you as you move into through 21 into 22 and now in 23 I think many many analysts believe that it will be important an important part of getting inflation down especially in the non-housing services sector uh getting wage inflation back to a level that is sustainable that is consistent with two percent inflation we actually have seen wages broadly moved down but just at a quite gradual pace so and that's you know that's a little bit of the uh the finding of the Bernanke paper with uh Blanchard of a few weeks ago which is very consistent with um with what I I would think Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and uh television you said in the past that you don't like to surprise markets it's kind of been The fed's View Market should have an idea of what you're going to do before you go in you also said a number of times that it would take a while to bring inflation down you reiterated that again today and that we would get to a point where inflation could be sticky so I'm wondering as we go into the next meetings how Wall Street or others should look at your reaction function what will you be reacting to time or data in other words if nothing much changes if we're looking at the same sort of Labor Market the same sort of inflation levels in July or in September uh or November will you move because you've said you feel you need to is it time that's going to require additional movement or would it be reversal in inflation so I I don't want to deal with with hypotheticals about different ways data might move out so we you know we of course we're not we don't go out of our way to surprise markets or the public at the same time our main focus has to be on getting the policy right and that's that's what we're doing here and that's what we'll do for the upcoming meetings I will say the July meeting will be live and uh we'll just have to see I think you'll you'll see the data you'll hear fed people talking about it and and markets will have to make a make a judgment well do you think inflation is likely to continue coming down based on the lags and based on your threat of additional movement or are we going to be in a period where we're not going to know what's happening you know I think you if you look at uh if you just look at I'll just point you to the forecast so inflation is running core pce inflation is running at about four and a half a little higher than four and a half percent and the the median fomc participant thinks it'll go down to 3.9 on a 12 month basis this is by the end of this year so that's expecting pretty substantial progress that's that's that's a pretty significant decline for half a year so that that's that that's the forecast um you know we'll we do try to be transparent in our reaction function we're we're committed to getting inflation down and uh that's the number one thing so that's how I think about it um Victoria Guido with Politico talk about the balance sheet and how you're thinking about it um what would what are you looking for to judge whether we're approaching Reserve scarcity and his treasury issue it's going to affect that also are you considering lowering the RRP rate in order to take some pressure off Banks so let me say first of all on the treasury part of it if I can talk about that and then go back to the balance sheet so on that um of course we've been very focused on that for a couple of months as everyone has treasury has laid out its boring borrowing plans publicly uh I think we all saw I saw the secretary's comments yesterday to the effect that treasury has consulted widely with Market participants about how to avoid Market disruption and that they're going to watch carefully for that so that's that's from the treasury which actually sets the you know the the borrowings at the FED we'll be monitoring market conditions carefully as the treasury refills the the TGA the adjustment process is very likely to involve both the reduction in the RRP facility and also in reserves it's really hard to say at the at the beginning of this which will be which will be greater we are starting at a very high level of reserves and still elevated or RP for to take up for that matter so we don't think reserves are likely to become scarce in the near term or even over the course of the year um so that's that's that's the that's the the treasury part of the answer we will of course continue to monitor um conditions in money markets and we're prepared to make adjustments to make sure that that monetary policy transmission works was there another part of your question uh yeah what um are you considering lowering the RRP rate to help take some pressure off Banks so we have a number of I would say the RRP doesn't look like it's it's pulling money out of out of the banking system it's actually been shrinking here lately uh so I don't think uh that's not something something we've we've thought about a lot over time it doesn't really look like that's that's something that we would do I think it's I think it's a tool that we have if we want to use it we can there are other tools we can we can use to address money market issues but I wouldn't say that that's something that's likely that we would do in the near term I don't know Janelle Marte with Bloomberg um have you seen sufficient Cooling in the housing market to bring inflation down for example how does the recent rebound affect your forecast and how does it factor into monetary policy well certainly housing very interest sensitive and it's the first place really or one of the first places that's either helped by low rates or or that is held back by by higher rates and we certainly saw that over the course of the last year we now see housing putting in a bottom and maybe even moving up a little bit um you know we're watching that situation carefully I do think we we will see rents rents and and house prices filtering into Housing Services inflation and uh I don't see them coming up quickly I do see them coming kind of wandering around at a relatively low level now and uh that's appropriate do you think you'll have to Target that with further rate increases well I think we look at everything we don't just look at housing so I think you know the way it works is individual participants sit in their offices all over the country and they write down their their forecast and including their most likely forecast including their rate forecast and then they send it in on Friday afternoon and we accumulate it and then we publish it for you so that's how that's how they do that well I don't know that housing is is is self going to be driving the rates picture but it's part of it thank you for taking the question um Mr chairman Edward Lawrence with Fox Business so I want to go back to comments you made about um in the past about unsustainable fiscal path the CBO projects the federal deficit to be 2.8 trillion uh in 10 years the CBO also says that federal debt will be 52 trillion by 2033. at what point do you talk more firmly with lawmakers about fiscal responsibility because I'm assuming monetary policy cannot handle alone the inflation or keep that inflation in check with the higher level spending I don't do that that's really not my job we we we hope and expect that other policy makers will respect our independence on on monetary policy and we don't see ourselves as uh as you know the judges of appropriate fiscal policy I will say and many of my predecessors have said that we are on an unsustainable fiscal path and that needs to be addressed over time but I think trying to get into uh into that with with lawmakers would be would be kind of inappropriate given our independence and our need to stick to our knitting is there any conversation then about the Federal Reserve financing some of that debt that we're seeing coming down the pike no under no circumstances Courtney thanks for taking our questions uh chair Powell um so looking at the SCP it looks like a GDP for this year was raised significantly your forecast for GDP this year uh the unemployment rate meanwhile was pulled downward and so should we take that as a sign that the committee is more confident about the prospects of a soft landing at least more uh at least as it relates to what you're expecting in in March you know I I would just say it this way I continue to think and this really hasn't changed that there is a path to uh getting inflation back down to two percent without having to see the kind of sharp downturn and large losses of employment that we've seen in so many pest instances it's it's possible a in a way a strong labor market uh is uh that gradually cools could it could Aid that along it could Aid that along but I I guess I want to come back to the the main thing which is though simply this we we see the committee as you can see from the SCP the committee is completely unified in the need to get inflation down to two percent and we'll do whatever it takes to get it down to two percent over time that is our plan and uh you know we we understand that allowing inflation to get entrenched into the in the U.S economy is the thing that we cannot cannot allow to happen for the benefit of today's workers and families and businesses but also for the future getting price stability back and and restored will benefit generations of people as long as it's sustained and it really is the Bedrock of the economy and you should understand that that is our top priority just a quick follow-up on that I'm just a little confused because you said the committee will do whatever it takes to get inflation down over time but when I look at the SCP inflation is still projected to be elevated next year but the FED funds rate is lower than where it is now can you help me understand that sure so um you know if you look two and three years out with the forecast first of all I wouldn't I wouldn't put too much weight on forecasts even one year out because they're so highly uncertain but what they're showing is that as inflation comes down in the in the forecast if you don't lower interest rates then real rates are actually going up right so it just to maintain a real rate the nominal rate at that point two years out let's say should come down just to maintain real rates and if and actually you know since we we're we're probably gonna we're we're having real rates that are going to have to be meaningfully positive uh and significantly so for us to get inflation down that probably means that that certainly means that that it will be appropriate to cut rates at such time as inflation is coming down really significantly and again we're talking about a couple years out I think as anyone can see not a single person on the committee wrote down a rate cut this year nor do I think it is uh at all likely to be appropriate if you think about it inflation has not really moved down it is it is not uh so far reacted much to our to our existing rate hikes and so we're gonna have to keep at it Julie um sorry thank you hi chapology AFP news agency the major report showed a rebound in May in the black rockers and unemployment is it consistent with the fed's maximum employment mandate are you worried about that about this rebound so we are of course worried about there are long-standing difference differences in racial and ethnic groups across across our labor market that's a factor that we don't we can't really address with our tools but we do consider that when we're thinking about what constitutes maximum employment it is for us a broad and inclusive goal and so we do watch that but remember all unemployment including black unemployment has been bouncing around right near historic lows historic modern lows here so we're still talking about I mean what is as strong a labor market as we've seen in you know a half century here in the United States so overall unemployment of 3.7 percent is is is three tenths higher than it was a measured to be at the last uh a month ago but still it's extraordinarily low and so it's a very very tight labor market follow-up first a little bit just on the rent question on housing we heard Governor Waller talk about how we I'll back up we haven't quite seen the slowdown in rent show up in CPI yet and we did hear Governor Waller talk about how an uptick in housing might mean that there's not going to be as much relief coming or a shorter bit of relief than we thought can you talk about how you're thinking about that and how that played into today's outcome I wouldn't say so that's you know as a factual matter that's correct we do need to see you know rents bottom out here or at least stay quite low in terms of their increases because we want we want the um you know we want inflation to come down and Rental uh is is a very large part of the CPI about a third and it's about half of that for the pce so it's important and so we're something that we're watching very carefully it's part of the overall picture I wouldn't say it's the decisive part but take a step back what you see is look at look at core inflation over the past six months a year you're just not saying a lot of progress not the kind of progress we want to see and that that's it's hard to avoid that and uh you know committee people in the committee the median went up significantly so that the median participant now thinks that core pce inflation on a 12-month basis will be 3.9 percent this year so once again every year for the past three years it's gone up over the course of the year and that's doing that again so we see that and we see that inflation forecasts are coming in low again and we see that that that tells us that we need to do more and so we're that's why you see the SCP with where it is could you also talk briefly about your outlook for wages and given the recent slowdown in core Services excluding housing how far you think wages might need to fall in order to to get inflation back in line so wages will continue to increase so we you know what we're talking about is having wage increases still at a very strong level but at a level that's consistent with two percent inflation over time and so I think we've seen some progress all of the major measures of wages have have moved down from extreme highly elevated levels a year or so ago and they're they're moving back down but but quite gradually and and you know we want to see that that process continue gradually of course you it's great to see wage increases particularly for people at the lower end of the income Spectrum but we want that as part of the process of getting inflation back down to two percent which benefits everyone I mean inflation hurts those same people more than anyone else people on a fixed income or hurt the worst and the fastest by high inflation thank you so much chairpower Greg Robb from MarketWatch I just wondered if the if he has talked at all about the labor market and and there's strikes now in Hollywood and now the United Auto Workers are talking about a possible strike I mean aren't workers they we have some workers have power now and are going to be seeking higher wages does that come up in your discussions thanks so the topic of wages in the labor market and Dynamics in the labor market could is about as Central a topic to our discussions as as anything I mean it's it's very labor economics you know and the labor market are utterly Central you know it's half of our mandate so we spend a lot of time talking about that I think um you know we there are structural issues that are really not for the fed and so we don't spend a lot of time although we take notice of of what's going on but we're not you know we're not involved in discussions or debates over over strikes and things like that but we you know we we look and we see what's going on and you know we're making judgments about what it will take to get inflation down to two percent in the Aggregate and as I said don't think that was about I didn't most folks would say now it wasn't really about that about wages at the beginning and it's becoming more about that as we as we get into really service sector inflation which is the part of the economy where we have seen the least progress it's good at Mark for the last question thank you Mr chairman Mark Hamrick with Bankrate wondering what your thoughts are now about systemic risk now that we're about three months past the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and also specifically what are the risks associated with commercial real estate as well as non-bank financials and could you further Elevate those risks with higher still rates possibly for longer so um we're trying to think where to start I'll start with commercial real estate we of course were watching that situation very carefully uh there's a substantial amount of commercial real estate in the banking system a large part of it is in smaller Banks it's well distributed to the extent it's well distributed than than the system could could take losses we do expect that there will be losses but there'll be there'll be banks that have concentrations and those banks will experience larger losses so we're well aware of that we're monitoring it carefully um you know it feels like it feels like something that will be around for some time as opposed to uh you know something that will suddenly hit and and you know work its way into systemic risk in terms of non-bank financials financial sector um there's been a ton of work and you know clearly in the um in the pandemic it really was it was the non-bank financial sector where where issues really arose and you know there's a lot of work going on in with the administration in particular leading that to try to address issues in the treasury market and and uh in all kinds of areas in non-bank financial market and but you know our jurisdiction at the FED is over Banks actually Bank holding companies and some banks so that's that's really our main focus um you know in terms of um the events of March as I mentioned earlier we will be carefully monitoring that situation you know our our job generally involves worrying about a lot of things uh that may go wrong that would include the banks it might be hard for me to identify something and that we don't worry about rather than that we do worry about so we're watching those things very carefully and as we see things unfold as we see what's happening with credit conditions and and also all the individual banks that are out there you know will be able to take to the extent it's appropriate we can take if they're macroeconomic implications we can take that into account in our rate setting and uh so I guess that's what I would say do you do you risk further exacerbating those issues if you get up to another 50 basis points so that's and I was I guess I meant to address that by saying as we as we watch we'll see what's happening and if we if we're seeing the kind of um tightening of conditions that that you could be referring to then we can factor that because really we use our our rate tool is is you know is it really has macroeconomic purposes so we'll take that into account of course we have responsibility for financial stability as well and that also is a factor that we're always going to be considering thank you very much

"Steve. Mr. Chairman, thank you. You have, I think a couple times in your opening remarks talked about this language in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate. Should we take that to mean that additional hikes are likely on the way? And should we also believe that all future meetings, say September and November, are live or are you in an every other meeting mode? Thank you. So we haven't made a decision to go to every other meeting. It's not something we've looked at. We're going to be going meeting by meeting, and as we go into each meeting, we're going to be asking ourselves the same questions. So we haven't made any decisions about any future meetings, including the pace at which we'd consider hiking. But we're going to be assessing the need for further tightening that may be appropriate. You read the language, to return inflation to 2 percent over time. I would say that the inter meeting data came in broadly in line with expectations, economic activity remained resilient, job creation remains strong while cooling a bit. And the June CPI report actually came in a bit better than expectations for a change. And the June CPI report of course was welcomed but it's only one report, one month's data. We hope that inflation will follow a lower path as was, that will be consistent with the CPI reading, but we don't know that and we're just going to need to see more data. So what are we going to be looking at? Really it will be the broader, the whole broader picture, and starting with, we're looking for moderate growth, right? We're looking for supply and demand through the economy coming into better balance. Including in particular the labor market. We'll be looking at inflation, we'll be asking ourselves; does this whole collection of data, do we assess it as suggesting that we need to raise rates further? And if we make that conclusion, then we will go ahead and raise rates. So that's how we're thinking about the next meeting. And you know, how we're thinking about meetings going forward potentially, but we're now mainly thinking about the next meeting. I will also say, since we're talking about it, between now and the September meeting, we get two more job reports, two more CPI reports, I think we have an ECI report coming later this week, which is employment compensation index, and lots of data on economic activity. All of that information is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting. I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting, if the data warranted, and I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that meeting. We're going to be making careful assessments, as I said, meeting by meeting and I'll close by saying; we've raised the Federal Funds Rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022, monetary policy we believe is restrictive and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. If I could just briefly follow-up on something you said there. You said the data in the inter meeting period, it probably came in line with expectations. Does that mean there's not likely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the Committee that two more hikes are necessary? I'm just going to go back to what I said. We, you know, that's the question. We have eight weeks now until the September meeting and all that data that I recited, we're going to be looking at all that and making that assessment then. And it really, we did have the one good reading and of course we welcome that, but it's just one reading, as everybody knows, and you know, we've seen, we've seen this before in the data. Many forecasts call for rates, for inflation to remain low, but we just don't know that until we see the data. So we'll be focusing on that. Jeanna. Thank you. Thanks for taking our questions, Chair Powell. Obviously you updated the language around growth in the statement today, you know, we've seen the Barbie movie numbers, we've seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts this summer. It seems like the American consumers are in pretty good shape and it does seem like growth is sort of picking back up a little bit, or at least doing well. And I wonder from your perspective if that continues, if we see growth not just stabilizing but doing, you know, performing well this summer, is that a problem because it's inflationary or is it good news because it suggests that a soft landing is more likely? Just how are you thinking about that sort of trajectory? Yeah, so I would say it this way; the overall resilience of the economy, the fact that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful negative impact of the labor market, the strength of the economy overall, that's a good thing. It's good to see that, of course. It's also you see consumer confidence coming up and things like that, that will support activity going forward. But you're right though, at the margin, stronger growth could lead, over time, to higher inflation and that would require an appropriate response for monetary policy. So we'll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time. Neil. Thanks, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin from Axios. So as you referenced earlier, near meeting period, soft CPI, jobs reports still strong but moderating [inaudible] good. So if you're [inaudible] independent, why not pause again? Why not stay on hold? Why not take another meeting off when the data was at least cutting in the direction you want to see? So, if you go back to what we're trying to do here, we're trying to achieve a stance of policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2 percent. At the last meeting, we wrote down our individual estimates of that, of what that would take, and the meaning of that was an additional two rate hikes. So, I would say we looked at the inter meeting data and as I mentioned, broadly consistent, not perfectly consistent but broadly consistent with expectations and as a result, we went ahead and took another step. And that's, you know, a labor market that continues to be strong but gradually slowing. I mentioned that the inflation report was actually a little better than expected, but you know, we're going to be careful about taking too much signal from a single reading. And you know, growth came in stronger than expected. So that's how we look at it, and so we did take that step today. Nick. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, markets widely believe the median FOMC participants' inflation forecast from June, from the 4th quarter of this year, will be too high given autos and shelter. That by September that may warrant a downward revision in the inflation forecast of 20-30 basis points. Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here, or do you need to see below trend growth and decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you've done enough? So it's hard to pick the pieces apart and say, you know, how much of this and how much of that, you know, we'll be looking at everything. And you know, we'll, of course we'll be looking to see whether the signal from June's CPI is replicated or the opposite of replicated or whether it's somewhere in the middle. We'll be looking at the growth data, we'll be looking at the labor market data very closely, of course, and making an overall judgment about that. It's the totality of the data, I think. But with a particular focus on making progress on inflation. If I can follow-up up, last month you said there were benefits to moderating the pace of increases because it would give you more information to make decisions. Would another CPI report like the one we just had in June allow you to at least maintain that slower pace and defer until the fall, any decision on whether you need that second rate hike? So, I'm just going to tell you again what we're going to do in September, we're going to look at two additional job reports, two additional CPI reports, lots of activity data, and that's what we're going to look at and we're going to make that decision then. And that decision could mean another hike in September, or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that level and again, the question we're going to be asking ourselves is, is the overall signal one that we need to do more? That we need to tighten further. And if we get that signal, whenever we get it, then, and that's the collective judgment of the Committee, then we will move ahead. If we don't, you know, then we'll have the option of maintaining policy at that level, but it's you know, it's really dependent so much on the data and we just don't have it yet. Chris. Hi, Chris Rugaber, Associated Press. So, consumer confidence in the economy is rising, likely in large part because of the declines in headline inflation, you also see wages are also rising faster than prices now, after trailing them for a long them. How much are Americans truly harmed by inflation at its current level, headline level of 3 percent, and with that in mind, when do you put some weight back on the employment side of the dual mandate? So, I guess I'd say it this way. First, it is a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much, because that's really what the public experience is, and I would say that having headline inflation move down that much almost creates a, it will strengthen the broad sense that the public has that inflation is coming down, which will in turn, we hope, help inflation continue to move down. So you are really, sorry, your question was? Well, you've talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation, how hard it is for people. So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at three? So I guess I would put it this way, we-- I'd say it this way; it's really a question of how do you balance the two risks; the risk of doing too much or doing too little, and you know, I would say that you know, we're coming to a place where there really are risks on both sides. It's hard to say exactly whether they're in balance or not, but as our stance has become more restrictive and inflation moderates, we do increasingly face that risk. But you know, we need to see that inflation is durably down that far, you know, as you know, we think and most economists think that core inflation is actually a better signal of where headline inflation is going, because headline inflation is affected greatly by volatile energy and food prices, so we would want core inflation to be coming down because that's what we think, that's, core is signaling where headline's going to go in the future. And core inflation is still pretty elevated, you know? There's reason to think it can come down now, but it's still quite elevated and so we think we need to stay on task, and we think we're going to need to hold, certainly hold policy at restrictive levels for some time. And we need to be prepared to raise further if we think that's appropriate. Well, and then if inflation were to-- just a quick follow-- if it stays at three or drops even a little bit more, I mean, how much of an increase in unemployment do you think is acceptable to get that last bit of inflation? People are talking about the potential difficulty of the last, so-called last mile of inflation. So, how much, again, how much unemployment do you think is justified to get down that last-- So, it is a very positive thing that, actually the unemployment rate is the same as it was when we lifted off in March of '22, at 3.6 percent, so that's a real blessing in that we've been able to achieve some disinflation and we don't seek to it, it's not that we're aiming to raise unemployment, but I would just say the historical record, we have to be honest about the historical record, which does suggest that when central banks go in and slow the economy to bring down inflation, the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions. And so that is still the likely outcome here. And you know, we hope that that's as little as possible. We have to be honest, that that is the likely outcome. The worst outcome for everyone, of course, would be not to deal with inflation now, not get it done, whatever the short-term social cost of getting inflation under control, the longer-term social costs of failing to do so are greater and the historical record is very, very clear on that. If you go through a period where inflation expectations are not anchored, inflation is volatile, it interferes with people's lives and with economic activity and you know, that's the thing we really need to avoid and will avoid. Michael McKee. At this point you say the policy is restrictive but all year long we have seen growth surprise to the upside, unemployment to the downside, and inflation lately, to the downside. So I'm wondering by definition, should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions, do you think you might need to do more because I'm curious about what you see as inflation dynamics now. Is the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation? People talk about base effects and higher energy costs, and now we have some large labor settlements. Or, is the economy disinflating and you're just, you're able to go back to the old fed policy of opportunistic disinflation? So, I'll just say again, the broader picture of what we want to see is we want to see easing of supply constraints and normalization of pandemic related distortions to demand and supply, we want to see economic growth running at moderate or modest levels to help ease inflationary pressures, we want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance, particularly in the labor market, and all of that should lead to declining inflationary pressures. What we see is we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together and we're seeing evidence of those things now, but I would say that what our eyes are telling us is that policy has not been restrictive enough for long enough to have its full desired effects. So we intend, again, to keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is coming down sustainably to our 2 percent target, and we're prepared to further tighten if that is appropriate. And we think the process, you know, still probably has a long way to go. Well do you think under current conditions you are restrictive enough unless something changes? Well, I think, we think you know, today's rate hike was appropriate and I think we're going to be looking at the incoming data to inform our decision at the next meeting about is the incoming data telling us that we need to do more and if it does tell us that, collectively if that's our view, then we will do more. Colby. Thank you, Colby Smith with the Financial Times. If September is in fact a live meeting, how does that square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month in explaining the rationale for holding the Funds rate steady at the June meeting? So, a more gradual pace doesn't go immediately to every other meeting. It could be two out of three meetings, right? It could be, it just means if you're slowing down, the point really was to slow down the decision cycle as we get closer and closer to we think our destination. And I wouldn't want to go automatically to every other meeting because I just don't think that's, we don't, I think it's not an environment where we want to provide a lot of forward guidance, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, we just want to keep moving at what we think is the right pace, and I do think it makes all the sense in the world to slow down as we now make these finely judged decisions, and so that's what we did. And so, I think it's possible, I mentioned before it's possible that we would move at consecutive meetings, we're not taking that off the table, or we might not. It's really going to depend on what the data tell us. That's the best we can do. So we shouldn't assume that every other meeting is the lowest tightening frequency let's say. It could be you know, longer intervals in between as well. I think we're, look, I think we're going to make a decision about the next meeting and then we're going to make a decision about the one after that. And I think it'll sort itself out. Howard. Thanks. Howard Schneider with Reuters. So, among your colleagues, there have been people who have said they feel that very little transmission has taken place so far from monetary policy into the economy and there are those who feel, they say, it's happened very fast this time and it's kind of up to date. Where are you on that continuum? So, there's a long running debate about the lags between changes in financial conditions and the response to those changes from economic activity and inflation, right? So we know that in the modern era, financial conditions move the anticipation of our decisions and that has clearly been the case in this cycle. So in a sense, the clock starts earlier than it used to. But that doesn't necessarily change the process and from that point on and it's not clear that it has. We also, this is-- I'll tell you what we know and then what we don't know. We know that financial conditions affect economic activity and inflation with a lag that can be long and variable, or lags plural, that can be long and variable. A lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags and by the way, that's just one component of the broader uncertainty that we face. So, I'll tell you how I think about this, first, the first thing to say is, we're determined to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time and we will use our tools to do that, no one should doubt that. I would look at it this way though, the real Federal Funds Rate is now in meaningfully positive territory. If you take the nominal Federal Funds Rate, subtract the mainstream estimate of near term inflation expectations, you get a real Federal Funds Rate that is well above most estimates of the longer term neutral rate. So I would say monetary policy is restrictive, more so after today's decision, meaning that it is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation. We'll keep monetary policy restricted until we think it's not appropriate to do so. So that's how I think about it. I mean if I sum it up, I would say; we've come a long way, we are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal over time. Inflation has proved, repeatedly has proved stronger than we and other forecasters have expected and at some point that may change. We have to be ready to follow the data and given how far we've come, we can afford to be a little patient as well as resolute as we let this unfold. On the credit side, I'm wondering if you saw anything in the latest SLOOS data that made you think you're getting a quantum of credit contraction beyond what you'd expect? The bank lending data really is, the growth rate's edging down towards below, heading below zero, which is usually you know, a recession indicator. So I guess the SLOOS will come our early next week and I would just say it's broadly consistent with what you would expect. You've got lending conditions tight and getting a little tighter, you've got weak demand, and you know, it gives a picture of a pretty tight credit conditions in the economy. I think it's really hard to tease out whether how much of that is from this source or that source, but I think what matters is the overall picture is of tight and tightening lending conditions. And that's what the SLOOS will say. Rachel. Hi Chair Powell, Rachel Siegal from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. Could you break down the reasons why inflation has fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that don't stem directly from rate hikes or that might be within your control at all, like easing supply chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year? Yeah. So, interesting question. So, let me start by saying that the inflation surge that we saw in the pandemic resulted from a collision of elevated demand and constrained supply, both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the pandemic and the response from fiscal and monetary policy. And we've always expected that the disinflationary process would stem from both from the normalization of those broad pandemic related supply and demand conditions, and from restrictive monetary policy which would help return the balance between supply and demand by restraining demand. And we think that's broadly what we're seeing. So to go break it down a little further, of course headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come down, mostly due to reversal of the effects from the war in Ukraine, and that's a good thing and the public experiences that, as I mentioned earlier. For core inflation, I'd say there also, there has been a role for most, for both factors, both that I mentioned. Clearly for goods, normalization supply conditions is playing an important role as is the reversal, the beginning of the reversal of spending back into services and away from goods. And take autos as an example, the combination of an increase in sales and inventories, while vehicle inflation is decelerated, points to a substantial role for supply, but there's also a role for demand as you know, the loans and things like that are more expensive, so they're both working there. Housing services inflation now starts to move down, clearly higher rates have slowed the housing market. You know, I would say monetary policy is working about as we expect, and we think it'll play an important role going forward, in particular in non-housing services where really, we think that's where the labor market will come in as a very important factor. So we think both of those sources of disinflation are playing an important role. I see, and just to follow-up up, do you think that of those two sources, the core will rely more heavily on seeing an impact from rate hikes or is there a more even split there too? I think monetary policy is going to be important going forward, because we, we're sort of reaping now the benefits of the reversal of some of the very specific pandemic things. We're seeing that with goods in particular. Supply chains and shortages moving and we're seeing, so I think going forward, monetary policy will be important, particularly in that, in the sector, in the non-housing services sector. Edward. Thank you Chair Powell. First, let me compliment your tie, the choice of tie, it's a good color. So, thanks for taking our questions. So the Beige Book, it said input cost pressures remain elevated for services firms but eased notably from manufacturing sectors. Is that an indication that there's a wage inflation pressure? And how do you target pressure on the wage inflation without pushing the economy into recession? Well I think the, as it relates to goods, it's really an indication that supply chains and shortages are easing. And so what was the first part of it? So, wage inflation. Like how do you target wage inflation without pushing an economy into a recession? I don't think we're targeting wage inflation. I think what we're looking for is a broad cooling in labor market conditions. And that's what we're seeing. So, wages have actually been gradually moving down, they're still at levels what would, that would be consistent over a long period of time with 2 percent inflation. Nonetheless, we're making progress there. And by so many indicators, labor market demand is cooling. You can look at surveys by workers and businesses who see that, you can look at the quits rate normalizing, you can look at job openings coming down. You can look at just job creation in the establishment survey has you know, it's still at a high level, but it was at a really extraordinarily high level for most of the last two years. So, you see cooling, particularly in private sector in the last, you know, in the last report. So, I think we see that, and it's happening at a gradual pace. So, that's actually not a bad thing, in a sense, because if what we see is a labor market, very strong demand for labor, which is really the engine of the economy, people are getting hired, many people going back to work, getting wages, spending money, and that's really what's driving the economy. But that is gradually slowing, it's gradually cooling, that's a good prescription for getting where we want to get. But still we see a push to raise minimum wage, we're seeing a lot of unions go on strike or threaten strike, and the common thing is they come out with agreements like big pay raises, like UPS and we have the auto workers coming up. Are you concerned about a trend of series of big unions, these contract pushing wage inflation then? Not for us to comment on contract negotiations. Not our job, not our role. You know, we monitor thing things and we'll keep an eye on them, but really, that's something that's handled at that level and not-- [ Inaudible ] Victoria. Hi, Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask about the SCP which suggests that you would cut rates as overall and core PCE get to around or under 3 percent. And so I'm wondering is the level of inflation what's sort of important there as you think about getting to 2 percent, when you might start cutting rates, or is the speed at which inflation is falling also important? I think you take both into account. I think you take everything into account when you start cutting rates. It would depend on the whole, on a wide range of things. And when people rain down rate cuts next year, you know, it just is a sense that inflation is coming down and we're comfortable that it's coming down and it's time to start cutting rates. I think, but I mean there's a lot of uncertainty between what happens you know, in the next meeting cycle, let alone the next year. Let alone the year after that. So, it's hard to say exactly what happens there. What's motivating people. So, if it's sort of stubbornly in the high twos, you wouldn't necessarily cut rates. I'm not going, I'm not saying that at all. I'm not giving you any numerical guidance around that. I'm saying we would, we'd be comfortable cutting rates when we're comfortable cutting rates, and that won't be this year I don't think, it would be, you know, many people wrote down rate cuts for next year. I think the meeting was several for next year. And that's just going to be a judgment that we have to make then, a full year from now and it'll be about how confident we are that inflation is in fact coming down to our 2 percent goal. Steve. A good part of Wall Street has become more confident that the fed is going to be able to engineer a soft landing and they've reduced their forecast for recession. And I'm wondering if the staff has changed its view on the likelihood of recession being likely and if you personally have changed your view in terms of becoming more confident that you can achieve a soft landing. So, it has been my view consistently, that we do have a shot, and my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that we've seen in some past instances, many past instances of tightening that look like ours. That's been my view, that's still my view. And I think you know, that's sort of consistent with what I see today. So, but it's a long way from assured and you know, we have a lot left to go to see that happen. So, the staff now has a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast, but given the resilience of the economy recently, they are no longer forecasting a recession. It's, I just want to note that it's, that our staff produces its own forecast which is independent of the forecast that we as FOMC participants produce, having an independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant forecast is really a strength of our process. There's just a lot of, I think, constructive diversity of opinion that helps us make, help informs our deliberations, helps us make I hope better decisions. And is the reason for optimism that inflation has come down and you still have a strong labor market? I mean does that add to the optimism? I wouldn't use the term optimism about this yet. I would say though that there's a pathway and yes, that's a good way to think about it. We've seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real costs in the labor market. And that's a really good thing. I would just also say the historical records suggest that there's very likely to be some softening in labor market conditions and consistent with having a soft landing, you would have some softening in the labor market conditions, and that's still likely as we, as we go forward with this process. But it's a good thing to date that we haven't really seen that. We've seen softening through other, not through unemployment, not through higher unemployment, we've seen softening through you know, job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels. The quits rate, so people are not quitting as much, we've seen participation, people coming in and so labor supply has improved, which has lowered the temperature in the labor market, which was quite overheated you know, going back a year or so. So we're seeing that kind of cooling and that's very healthy and you know, we hope it continues. Jeff. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Jeff Cox from CNBC.com. You and other fed officials in the past have suggested that you don't need to keep hiking until inflation hits 2 percent, that as long as you see continued progress. So I'm wondering how close do you need to get with the inflation numbers coming down, how many months of data do you need to see that will give you sufficient confidence and how far does this fight need to go before you're willing to kind of declare victory on it? So the idea that we would keep hiking until inflation gets to 2 percent, it would be a prescription of going way past the target. That's clearly not the appropriate way to think about it. So, and in fact, if you look at our forecast, we, the median participant, and again, these are forecast out years, so take them with a grain of salt. But people are cutting rates next year because you know, the Federal Funds Rate is at a restrictive level now. So, if we see inflation coming down credibly, sustainably, then we don't need to be at a restrictive level anymore, we can you know, we can move back to a neutral level and then below a neutral level as sort of the point. I think we would, you know, we would, we of course would be very careful about that, we'd really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a sustainable level. And it's hard to make, I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when and where that would be. But that's the way I would think about it, is you'd start, you'd stop raising long before you got to 2 percent inflation and you'd start cutting before you got to 2 percent inflation too, because we don't see ourselves getting to 2 percent inflation until, you know, all the way back to 2, until 2025 or so, so. >> Jennifer. Thank you Chair Powell, Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. It's been over four months since a handoff of regional banks, including Silicon Valley Bank, failed. When you look at credit conditions now, given Bank of California's acquisition of PacWest, does this acquisition suggest the full impact has not been felt or are you comfortable saying that we've seen most of the ripple effects that may have occurred at this point and how does this play into your outlook for policy? So I don't want to comment on any particular merger proposal, but I will say things have settled down for sure out there. Deposit [inaudible] have stabilized, capital and liquidity remain strong. Aggregate bank lending was stable quarter over quarter, and is up significantly year over year. Banking scatter profits, generally are coming in strong this quarter and overall the banking system remains strong and resilient. Of course we're still watching you know, the situation carefully, and monitoring you know, monitoring conditions in the banking sector. In terms of the actual effect on, if you think of a particular set of banks that were affected because of their size and business model and things like that, they were more affected by the turmoil in March than others. It's very hard, as I mentioned, it's very hard to sort of tease out the effects on this very large economy of ours, from them tightening. They may be tightening a little bit more, probably are, than other banks. The SLOOS has been telling us for more than a year, that banking conditions are tightening. That process is ongoing and that will restrain economic growth. So, I think we have to take a step back from, I can't separate those anymore. I think basically we're just looking at the overall picture. Which is one of tightening credit conditions. And that's going to restrain economic activity, is restraining economic activity. So, that's how I would look at it. And how is that informing your outlook for setting policy? So I think we, that goes, that is an expected result of tightening interest rate policy is that is the bank credit conditions would, bank lending conditions would tighten as well. And so the question is, is it more effective this time because of what happened in May? I just don't think we know that. I think we're looking at the current data and GDP and we're seeing strong spending. We're seeing a strong economy, and it's made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the third time since the March events. And I, it seems like the economy is weathering this well, but of course we're watching it carefully and expect to continue to do that. Megan. Hi Chair Powell. Thanks for taking our questions. Megan Cassella with Barron's. I wondered on wages if you were at all concerned about any of the inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation, which is likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer that we've been seeing. Well, wages in excess of inflation means real wages are positive again, that's a great thing. Of course we want that, we want people to have real wages, but we want wages to be going up at a level that's consistent with 2 percent inflation over time. As I mentioned, nominal wages have been coming down gradually, and that's what we want to see, we expect to see more of that. That's just more of what's consistent over a longer period of time. We don't really think that wages were an important cause of inflation in the first year or so of the outbreak. But I would say that wages are probably an important issue going forward. Labor market conditions broadly are going to be an important part of getting inflation back down and that's why we think we need some further softening in labor market conditions. This goes sort of to the balance of risks question, but you mentioned at the start how you're keeping an eye on consumer activity and whether there might be some sort of a rebound there, and I'm curious what the fed's explanation would be to families if further interest rate hikes start to hit, the labor market start to you know, drive that sentiment back down. What's the message there of why you continue to keep rates elevated or to raise them? Well, you know, we have a job assigned to us by Congress to get inflation under control. And we think the single most important thing we can do to benefit those very families, especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum, is to get inflation sustainably under control and restore price stability. We think that is the most important thing we can do now and we're determined to do that. And I would just point out that the people who are the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income, who you know, when you're talking about travel or, you know, transportation costs, heating costs, clothing, food, things like that, those, if you're just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up, you're in trouble right away. Even middle class people have some resources and can absorb inflation, people, the people on the lower end of the income spectrum have a harder time doing that. So, we need to get this done and you know, the record is clear that if we take too long or if we don't succeed that the pain will only be greater. So, that's how I would explain what we're doing. Simon. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with The Economist. You had said last month that this meeting this week was going to be a live one. In the event the market had assigned a, you know, roughly 99 percent probability to the rate move that you announced today. The decision was of course unanimous, and the statement was basically unchanged from last month. So may I ask, you know, to what extent was the meeting actually a live one? Was there ever any doubt over the past two days about what the decision was actually going to be? Well I mean you could-- was there doubt? Look, I would say there's a range of views on the Committee and when you see the minutes in three weeks you'll see that. There's a range of views about what we should do at this meeting and what we should do at the next meeting, and time's a process that we go through. Many times when we go into a meeting, the decision is not you know, fundamentally in doubt. Nonetheless, we have the meeting and some meetings are you know, less uncertain than others and I'll just leave it at that. Evan. Evan Ryser, Market News International. Thank you Chair Powell. Financial conditions have been loosening at a fairly steady clip in recent weeks, the dollar, the stock market, et cetera. What does that mean for the fed and being sure that inflation will come down to target? So, we monitor of course financial conditions, broad financial conditions. You're right, it's the dollar and equities, but and you know, we're of course very focused on rates and our own policy. You know, we will, we're going to use our policy tools to working through financial conditions to get inflation under control. The implication is you know, we will do what it takes to get inflation down and in principle, that could mean that if financial conditions get looser we have to do more. But what tends to happen though is financial conditions get in and out of alignment with what we're doing, and ultimately over time we get where we need to go. If I could also ask about the SCP in June that showed rate cuts. Do you expect the fed to cut nominal rates next year, while also continuing QT? So that could happen. The question is, you know, is that consistent with-- so if you think about both of them as normalization, imagine it's a world where things are okay and it's time to bring rates down from what are restrictive levels to more normal levels. Normalization in the case of the balance sheet would be to reduce QT so, or to continue it depending on where you are in the cycle. So they are two independent things and you know, really the active tool of monetary policy is rates. But you can imagine circumstances in which it would be appropriate to have them working in what might be seen to be different ways. But that wouldn't be the case. Let's go to Kyle. Thanks Chair Powell, Kyle Campbell with American Banker. I have a question about the discount window. I'm wondering if since the bank failures of the spring, if you've seen signs of banks have taken more steps to be proactive in assuring that they're ready to use that facility if they need to and if you have any sort of thoughts on whether policies might be appropriate for making sure the banks sort of test regularly to show that they are prepared to use it? Thanks. So that's a very important thing, yes, and yes to both sides of that, you know. Yes, banks are now working to see that they are ready to use the discount window and we are strongly encouraging them to do that. Banks broadly. We did find, as you know, during the events of March and that you know, that it's a little clunkier, or it can be a little clunkier and not as quick as it needs to be sometimes. So, why not be in a situation where you're just much more ready in case you need to access the discount window. Let's go to Mark Hamrick. Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate. You've talked in the past about getting the housing market back into better balance, excuse me, and also that the market might have bottomed. Where do you see that situation and balance, or lack thereof, right now particularly with the restrained, constrained inventory of existing homes that might otherwise be coming onto market at a time when existing homeowners are reluctant to move and also all that happening with the 30-year fixed rate mortgage still around 7 percent on the heels of fed tightening and with what you're talking about tightening industry lending standards. Are we getting closer to balance or farther away? What's your sense? I think we've got a ways to go to get back to balance. Really for the reasons that you talked about. With existing homes, you know, there are many people who have low rate mortgages and whereas they might want to sell in a normal situation, they're not going to because they have so much value in their mortgage, which means that supply of existing homes is really, really tight, which is keeping prices up. On the other hand, there's you know, there's a lot of supply coming online now and there are people coming into a lot of the buyers are, you know, first-time buyers coming in, buying at you know, with these, you know, with these relatively elevated mortgage rates. But I think this will take some time to work through, hopefully more supply comes online and you know, we work through it. We're still living through the you know, the aftermath of the pandemic. We'll go to Nancy for the last question. Hi Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Russia has pulled out of an agreement allowing shipments of grains, safe passage through the Black Sea and alternative routes at this point could be closed off. Just wondering how could that contribute to higher food prices and inflation generally and how closely are you watching that? We are watching it, of course, very closely. And you're right, the withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative does raise concerns about global food security, particularly for poorer countries that import a large share of their food. Grain prices did go up on this news but they remain well-below their peaks of last spring. And the moves that we've seen so far, I would say are not expected to make a significant contribution to U.S. inflation. Of course we will be watching that situation carefully. So you don't think it would have a big effect on fed policy at this point? Doesn't, you wouldn't say so looking at what we know now. Thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you."

"MICHELLE SMITH. Colby. COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. What makes the Committee inclined to think that the fed funds rate at this level is not yet sufficiently restrictive, especially when officials are forecasting a slightly more benign inflation outlook for this year? There's noted uncertainty about policy lags. Headwinds have emerged from the looming government shutdown, the end of federal childcare funding, resumption of student debt payments-things of that nature. CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would characterize the, the situation a little bit differently. So we decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate where it is-at 5Â¼ to 5Â½ percent-while continuing to reduce our securities holdings. And we say we're committed to achieving and sustaining a stance of monetary policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring down inflation to 2 percent over time-we said that. But the fact that we decided to maintain the policy rate at this meeting doesn't mean that we've decided that we have or have not at this time reached that-that stance of monetary policy that we're seeking. If you looked at the SEP, as you-as you obviously will have done, you will see that a majority of participants believe that it is more likely than not that we will-that it will be appropriate for us to raise rates one more time in the two remaining meetings this year. Others believe that we have already reached that. So it's, it's something where we're-by, by-we're not making a decision by, by deciding to-about that question by deciding to just maintain the rate and await further data. COLBY SMITH. So, right now, it's still an open question about ""sufficiently restrictive""-you're not saying today that we've reached this level? CHAIR POWELL. We're not saying-yeah, no, no-clearly, we're just-what we decided to do is maintain a policy rate and await further data. We want to see convincing evidence, really, that we have reached the appropriate level, and then, you know, we're-we've-we've seen progress, and, and we welcome that. But, you know, we need to see more progress before we'll be willing to-to reach that conclusion. COLBY SMITH. And just on the 2024 projections-what's behind that shallower path for interest rate cuts and the need for real rates to be 50 basis points higher? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So I would say it this way: First of all, interest rates-real interest rates are, are positive now. They're meaningfully positive, and that's a good thing. We need policy to be restrictive so that we can get inflation down to target. Okay. And we need-we're going to need that to remain to be the case for some time. So I think, you know-remember that the-of course, the SEP is not a plan that is negotiated or discussed, really, as a plan. It's a cumulation, really, and what you see are the medians. It's a cumulation of individual forecasts from 19 people, and then what you're seeing are the medians. So I wouldn't want to, you know, bestow upon it the idea that, that it's really a plan. But what it reflects, though, is that economic activity's been stronger than we expected-stronger than I think everyone expected. And, and so what you're-what you're seeing is, this is what people believe, as of now, will be appropriate to achieve what we're looking to achieve, which is progress toward our-toward our inflation goal, as you see in the SEP. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let's go to Rachel. RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell. Rachel Siegel from the Washington Post. Thanks for taking our questions. How would you characterize the debate around another hike or holding steady? Is it discussion around lag times, fear of too much slowing, too little slowing? Could you walk us through what this disagreement was about at the meeting? CHAIR POWELL. Yeah. So the proposal at the meeting was to-was to maintain our current policy stance, and, and I think there was obviously unanimous support for that. But this, of course, is an SEP meeting, and so people write down what they think. And you've got-you have some-you saw, I think-seven wrote down no hike at this-at this meeting-or between now and the end of the year. And I think 12 wrote down another single hike in one of the next two meetings that we have between the end of the year. So it wasn't like we were arguing over that-people just stating their positions-and, really, what, what people are saying is, ""Let's see how the data come in."" You know, we, we want to see-you know what we want to see. We want to see that, that this, this-these good inflation readings that we've been seeing for the last three months-we want to see that it's more than just three months, right? We want to see, you know-the, the labor market report that we received, the last one that we received, was a good example of what we do-of what we do want to see. It was a combination of, of, you know, of-across a broad range of indicators, continuing rebalancing of the labor market. So those are the two things-so those are our two mandate variables, and, and that's, that's the progress that we want to see. But I think people-they want to be convinced, you know-they want to be careful to-not to jump to a conclusion, really, one way or the other-but just be convinced that the data, you know, support that conclusion. And that's why, given how far we've come and how quickly we've come, we're actually in a position to be able to proceed carefully as we assess the incoming data and the evolving outlooks and risks and make these decisions meeting by meeting. RACHEL SIEGEL. I see. And, in your view, what would-I know nothing has been decided yet-but what would one more hike at the end of the year do to the economy or to inflation? And on the other side, what would no hike do, if you could sort of game that out for us? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, you, you can make the argument that one hike one way or the other won't matter. But, for us, we're, we're trying-obviously, as a group, it's a pretty tight cluster of, of where we think that, that policy stance might be, but we're always going to be learning from data. You know, we've learned all through the course of the last year that, actually, we needed to go further than we had thought. If you go back a year-and what we thought, what we wrote down-it's actually gotten higher and higher. So we, we don't really know until-and that's why, again, we-we're in a position to proceed carefully at this point. A year ago, we proceeded pretty quickly to get rates up. Now-now we're fairly close, we think, to where we need to get. It's, it's just a question of reaching the right stance. I wouldn't attribute huge importance to one hike in, in macroeconomic terms. Nonetheless, you know, we need-we need to get to a place where we're confident that we have a stance that will bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. That's what we need to get to, and we've been-you know, we've been moving toward it. As we've gotten closer to it, we've slowed the pace at which we've moved. I think that was appropriate. And now that we're getting closer, we, we-again, we have the ability to proceed carefully. MICHELLE SMITH. Thanks. Let's go to Steve. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, I want to return to Colby's question here. What is it saying about the Committee's view of the inflation dynamic in the economy that you achieve the same forecast inflation rate for next year but need another half a point of the funds rate on it? Does it tell you that-does it tell us that the Committee believes inflation to be more persistent-requires more medicine, effectively? And I guess a related question is, if you're going to project a funds rate above the longer-run rate for four years in a row, at what point do we start to think, ""Hey, maybe the longer rate or the neutral rate is actually higher""? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I, I guess I would point more to-rather than pointing to a sense of inflation having become more persistent, I wouldn't think-that's not-we've, we've seen inflation be more persistent over the course of the past year, but I wouldn't say that's something that's appeared in the recent data. It's more about stronger economic activity, I would say. So if, if I had to attribute one thing-again, we're, we're picking medians here and trying to attribute one explanation. But I think, broadly, stronger economic activity means, means rates-we have to do more with rates, and that's what-that's what that meaning is, is telling you. In terms of, of what the neutral rate can be-you know, we-we know it by its works. We only know it by its works, really. We can't-we can't-you know, the, the models and, and-that we use, you-ultimately, you only know when you get there and by, by the way the economy reacts. And, again, that's another reason why we're-why we're moving carefully now, because, you know, there are lags here. So it, it may-it may, of course, be that the-that the neutral rate has risen. You do see people-you don't see the median moving-but you do see people raising their estimates of, of the neutral rate, and it's certainly plausible that the neutral rate is higher than, than the longer-run rate. Remember-what we write down in the SEP is the longer-run rate. It is certainly possible that, you know, that the-that the neutral rate at this moment is higher than that, and that-that's part of the explanation for why the economy has been more resilient than, than expected. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Howard. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Thank you. So you've said several times that the economy needed a period of below-trend growth to get inflation consistently back to 2 percent. You kind of get that in 2024 a little bit-1.5 percent is just a touch below what's the estimate of potential. So the fact that you're getting so much done at so much less cost, does that represent a change in how you think inflation works, a change in how you think the economy works, a change in the mix of supply healing versus demand destruction that's necessary to achieve this? CHAIR POWELL. Yes, of course. It is a-it is a good thing that we, we've seen now meaningful rebalancing in the labor market without an increase in unemployment, and that's, that's because we're seeing that rebalancing in other places-in, for example, job openings and in the jobs-worker gap. You're also seeing supply-side things-so, so that's happening. I would say, though, we still-I still think, and I think, broadly, people still think, that there will have to be some softening in the labor market that can come through more supply, as we've seen as well. Also, remember, the natural rate, we think, is, is coming down, which is a supply-side thing, so that the, the gap between any given unemployment rate that's lower than that and the natural rate comes down. That's a way for supply-that's a way for the labor market to achieve a better balance. So all of those things are happening. You're right-in, in the median forecast, we don't see a big increase in unemployment. We do see an increase, and-but that's-that really is just ""playing forward"" the trends that we've been seeing. That is not guaranteed. There, there may come a time when unemployment goes up more than that, but that's, that's really what we've been seeing is, progress without higher unemployment for now. HOWARD SCHNEIDER. So just to, to boil that down for a second-you know, we've gone from a very narrow path to a-to a soft landing to something different. Would you call the soft landing now a baseline expectation? CHAIR POWELL. No, no-I would not do that. I, I would just say-what, what would I say about that? I've always thought that the soft landing was, was a plausible outcome-that there was a path, really, to, to a soft landing. I've thought that, and I've said that since we lifted off. It's also possible that, that the path has narrowed, and it's widened, apparently. Ultimately, it-this may be decided by factors that are outside our control at the end of the day. But I do think it's-I do think it's possible. And, you know-I also think, you know, this is why we're in a position to, to move carefully again. That-we, we will restore price stability. We, we know that we have to do that, and we know the public depends on us doing that, and we know that we have to do it so that we can achieve the kind of labor market that we all want to achieve, which is an extended period-sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all. We know that. The fact that we've come this far lets us really proceed carefully, as I keep saying. So I think, you know, that's, that's the end we're trying to achieve. I wouldn't want to handicap the likelihood of it, though. It's not up to me to do that. MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, both you and Vice Chair Williams have indicated that ""sufficiently restrictive"" will be judged on a real rather than nominal basis, implying some scope for nominal rate cuts next year-provided further compelling evidence that price pressures will continue to subside. Is the FOMC focused on targeting a real level of policy restriction? And can you explain what would constitute enough evidence that will allow the FOMC to normalize the nominal stance of policy while keeping real policy settings sufficiently restrictive? CHAIR POWELL. I mean, yes-we, we understand that it's a real rate that will matter and that needs to be sufficiently restrictive. And, again, I would say, you know-you know ""sufficiently restrictive"" only when you see it. You-it's not something you can arrive at with confidence in a model or, or in various estimates, you know. And so what are we seeing? We're, we're seeing, you know, through a combination of the, you know, the unwinding of the pandemic-related demand and supply distortions and monetary policy's work in suppressing demand or, or, you know, alleviating very high demand-the combination of those two things is actually working. You're seeing, you know, inflation coming down. It's principally now in goods-also in housing services. You begin to see effects of it in nonhousing services as well. So I think-we think that that is working. And I, I think, you know-as we've said, we, we want to reach that-we want to reach something that we're confident gets us to that level. And I think confidence comes from seeing, you know, enough data that you feel like, ""Yes, okay, this feels like it-we can-we can, for now, decide that this is the right level and just agree to stay here."" We're not permanently deciding not to go higher, but, but we would-let's say, if we get to that level-and then the question is, how long do you stay at that level? And that's a whole other set of questions. For now, the question is trying to find that level where we think we can stay there. And we haven't-we haven't gotten to a point of confidence about that yet. That's, that's what we're-that's, that's the stage we're at, though. NICK TIMIRAOS. But it looks like there was-because there was an across-the-board drop in the core PCE projection-core PCE inflation projection for this year, and even then it seems possible that core PCE inflation could come in even lower than the median at 3.7 percent. Would you see a case to raise rates still if it turned out that you were going to achieve the same real rate this year because the decline in inflation proceeds somewhat better than you-than you currently anticipate? CHAIR POWELL. The decision that we make at, you know, at each meeting and, certainly, at the-at the last two meetings this year-it's going to depend on the totality of all the data: so, the inflation data, the labor market data, the growth data, the, the balance of risks, and the other events that are happening out there. We'll make-we take all of that into account, so I can't really answer a hypothetical about one piece of that. It'll-it'll be trying to reach a judgment over whether we should move forward with another rate hike overall and whether that would increase our confidence that, that, yes, this is an appropriate move, and it will help, help us be more confident that we've gotten to the level that we need to get to. MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna. JEANNA SMIALEK. Thanks, Chair Powell. Following up on Nick's question, actually-John Williams, the New York Fed president, obviously, has said things to the effect of, ""Next year, as we see inflation kind of""-again, to Nick's point-""as, as we see inflation coming down, we're going to need to reduce interest rates to make sure that we're not squeezing the economy harder and harder over time."" And I wonder if that's basically the logic that you apply-you know, is that how you think about it? And then I also wonder-in the last press conference, you said something to the effect of, you know, ""It's a full year out-those discussions,"" and people interpreted that to mean that you didn't see a possibility of a rate cut in the first half of next year. And I wonder if that was what you meant by that or whether, you know-how you're thinking about that timing. CHAIR POWELL. No. When-so when I answer these questions about hypotheticals about, about cutting, I'm never intending to send a signal about timing; I'm just answering them as, as the question is expressed. So, so please-I, I wouldn't want to be taken that way. Sorry-the first question was, is that how? Yeah, so we're-as we go into next year, that's the question we'll be asking is-you know, taking into account lags and, and everything else we know about the economy and everything we know about monetary policy, the, the time will come at some point, and I'm not saying when, that it's-that it's appropriate to cut. Part of that may be that real rates are rising because inflation is coming down. Part of it just may be that-it'll be all the factors that we see in the economy. And, you know, that time will certainly come at some point. And you-what you see is us writing down, you know, a year ahead, estimates of what that might be. And, you know, there's-you know, there's so much uncertainty around that. In, in-when we-in the moment, we'll do what we think makes sense. No one will look back at this and say, ""Hey, we made a plan."" It's not like that at all. It's-this is-these are estimates made a year in advance that are highly uncertain, and that's how it is. MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. NEIL IRWIN. Thanks so much, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. I wonder-how do you think about the question of whether the strong GDP growth we've been seeing is driven by excess demand versus supply-side factors, productivity, labor force growth? And, relatedly, if GDP keeps coming in ""hot,"" even in the absence of inflation resurgence, would that on its own be a reason to consider more tightening? CHAIR POWELL. So on, on your first question-I mean, we're looking at GDP very, very carefully to try to understand really what's the direction of it-what's, what's driving it. And it's, it's a lot of consumer spending, you know. It's been-the consumer's been very robust in its-in spending. So that is, you know, that's how we're looking at it. Sorry, your second question was- NEIL IRWIN. Does GDP stays ""hot,"" but without inflation? CHAIR POWELL. So I, I think the question will be-GDP is not our mandate, right? Maximum employment and price stability are the mandates. The question will be, is, is the level-is GDP-is the-is the heat that we see in GDP-is it really a threat to our ability to get back to 2 percent inflation? That's going to be the question. It's not-it's not a question about GDP on its own. It's, you-you know, you're expecting to see the-this improvement, you know-continued rebalancing in the labor market and inflation moving back down to 2 percent in a sustainable way. We have to have confidence in that, and, you know, we'd be-we'd be looking at GDP just, just to the extent that it threatens one or both of those. MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guido with Politico. There are multiple external factors that are playing out right now. We see rising oil prices. We see auto workers striking. There's the looming, very real possibility of a government shutdown. And I was just wondering, for each of those things, could you talk about how you're thinking about how that might affect the course for the Fed and the economy? CHAIR POWELL. So there is a-there is a long list, and you hit some of them. But it-you know, it's, it's the strike, it's government shutdown, resumption of student loan payments, higher long-term rates, oil price shock. You know, you could-there are a lot of things that you can-you can look at. And, you know-so, what we try to do is assess all of them and, and handicap all of them. And, ultimately, though, there's so much uncertainty around, around these things. I mean, to, to start with the strike-first of all, we absolutely don't comment on the strike, as we have no view on the strike one way or the other. But we, we do have to make an assessment of its economic effects to do our jobs. So, you know, the, the thing about it is-so uncertain. It will depend. The economic effects-it could affect-you've looked-we've looked back at history-it could affect economic output, hiring, and inflation. But that's really going to depend on how broad it is and how long it's sustained for. And we-and then it also depends on how quickly production can make up for, for lost production. So none of those things are known right now. It's very, very hard to know. So you just have to leave that uncertain. And, and we'll be learning, I think, over the course of the next intermeeting period, much more about that. And the same is true for the others. We, we-I don't know if you mentioned shutdown; I think of all of these as being on the list. We don't comment on that. It hasn't traditionally had much of a macroeconomic effect. You know, energy prices being higher-that's-that is a significant thing. We-energy prices being up can affect spending. It can affect the consumer over time. A sustained period of higher-of higher energy prices can affect consumer expectations about inflation. We tend to look through short-term volatility and look at-look at core inflation. But so the question is, how long are, are higher prices sustained? We have to-we have to take those macroeconomic effects into account as well. Those are-those are some of them. I'm not sure if I hit them all. But-I mean, ultimately, you know, you're, you're coming into this with an economy that appears to have significant momentum. And that's, that's what we start with. And we-but we do have this collection of risks that you mentioned. MICHELLE SMITH. Craig. CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg News. I was a little surprised, Chair Powell, to hear you say that a soft landing is not a primary objective. This economy's seeing added supply in a way that could create long-term inflation stability. We have prime-age labor force participation moving up where people can add skills. Workers want to work. We have a boom in manufacturing construction. We've had a decent spate of homebuilding. And since inflation's coming down with strong GDP growth, we may have higher productivity. All are which-good for the Fed's longer-run target of low inflation. And if we lose that in a recession, aren't we opting for the awful hysteresis that we had in 2010? So are you taking this into account as you pursue policy? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. To begin: A soft landing is a primary objective, and I did not say otherwise. I mean, that's, that's what we've been trying to achieve for all this time. The, the real point, though, is-the, the worst thing we can do is to fail to restore price stability, because the record is clear on that: If you, you don't restore price stability, inflation comes back, and you go through-you can have a long period where the economy's just very uncertain, and it will affect growth; it will affect all kinds of things. It can be a miserable period to have inflation constantly coming back and the Fed coming in and having to tighten again and again. So the best thing we can do for everyone, we believe, is to restore price stability. I think now, today, we actually-you know, we, we have the ability to be careful at this point and move carefully, and that's what we're planning to do. So we fully appreciate that-you know, the benefits of being able to continue what we see already, which is rebalancing in the labor market and inflation coming down without seeing, you know, an important, large increase in unemployment, which has been typical of other tightening cycles. So- MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Chris. CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Hi. Thank you. Chris Rugaber at Associated Press. When you look at the disinflation that has taken place so far, do you see it mostly as a result of what some economists are calling ""the low-hanging fruit""-such as the unwinding of supply chain snarls and other pandemic disruptions-or is it more a broad disinflationary trend that involves most goods and services across the economy? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So if I-if I understood your question, it's-I would say it this way: I think we knew from the time-from before when we lifted off, but certainly by the time we lift-we knew that bringing inflation back down was going to take, as I call it, the unwinding of these distortions to both supply and demand that happened because of the pandemic and the response. So that unwinding was going to be important. In addition, monetary policy was going to help. It was going to help supply side heal by, by cooling demand off and, just in general, better aligning supply with demand. So those two forces were always going to be important. I think it's very hard to pull them apart. They work together. I, I do think both of them are at work now, and I think they're at work in a way that shows you the progress that we-that we are seeing. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Mike. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. In June, you forecast a 5.6 percent year-end median fed funds rate, and since then, you've more than doubled your growth forecast. You lowered your unemployment forecast significantly. So, what would justify that last move, because the median forecast is for lower inflation? And given all the known unknowns that you face, how much confidence do you have, can investors have, or the American people have in your forecasts? CHAIR POWELL. Well, forecasts are highly uncertain. Forecasting is very difficult. Forecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about. But to get to, to your question, though-what's happened is, growth has come in stronger, right? Stronger than expected-and that's required higher rates. Unemployment, you know-you also see that the, the ultimate unemployment rate is not as high, but that-that's really because of what we've been seeing in the labor market. We've seen more and more progress in the labor market without seeing significantly higher unemployment. So we're, we're continuing that trend. In terms of inflation, you, you are seeing-the last three readings are, are very good readings. It's only three readings, you know. We-we're well aware that we need to see more than three readings. But if you look at June, July, and August, you're looking at, you know, really significant declines in core inflation, largely in the goods sector-also to some extent in housing services and just a little in nonhousing services. Those are the three buckets. Headline inflation, of course, has come way down, largely due to lower energy prices, some of which is now reversing. So I think-people should know that, that economic forecasting is very difficult, and these are highly uncertain forecasts. But these are-these are our forecasts. You know, they're, they're-we have very high-quality people working on these forecasts, and I think they stand up well against other forecasters. But just the nature of the business is, the economy is very difficult to forecast. MICHAEL MCKEE. Given the-given the forecast that you have, what justified not moving today, and what could justify moving in the future if you think inflation is coming down? In other words, why did you leave that extra dot in? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I, I think we have come very far very fast in, in the, the rate increases that we've made. And I think it was important at the beginning that we move quickly, and we did. And, and I think as we get closer to the rate that we think-the stance of monetary policy that we think is appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time, you know, the risks become more two sided, and the risk of overtightening and the risk of, of undertightening becomes more equal. And I think the, the natural, commonsense thing to do is, as you approach that, you move a little more slowly as you get closer to it. And that, that's what we're doing. So we're, we're taking advantage of the fact that we have moved quickly to move a little more carefully now as we-as we sort of find our way to, to the right level of restriction that we need to get inflation back down to 2 percent. MICHELLE SMITH. Jennifer. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Thank you, Chair Powell. Jennifer Schonberger with Yahoo Finance. With your focus on year-over-year PCE, isn't it true that base effects are huge and that by the time you meet in November, that it's more likely that you'll have a low PCE number that would make you feel more comfortable? And, secondly, how would the lack of key indicators-like CPI, the jobs report-impact your approach in upcoming meetings if we were to have a government shutdown? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Sorry-yeah, I missed the first question. What was-missed what factors? JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. The base factors. CHAIR POWELL. Base factors. Ah. Okay. So on that, we're, you know, we're looking at just monthly, right? You can look at just monthly readings and see what the increase was from the prior month. So you're right-when you go back 3, 6, and 12 months, you get base factors. But we can-we can adjust for that. In terms of not getting data-you know, again, we don't-we don't comment on government shutdowns. It-it's possible-if, if there is a government shutdown and it lasts through the, the next meeting, then it's possible we wouldn't-we wouldn't be getting some of the data that we would ordinarily get, and we-you know, we would just have to deal with that. And I don't know. It's hard for me to say in advance how that would affect that meeting. It would depend on all kinds of factors that I don't know about now. But it's certainly a reality that, that that's a possibility. JENNIFER SCHONBERGER. Would you feel more comfortable on the base effects that-as those kind of fall out of the equation for the next couple of readings by November, would you feel more comfortable at that point? CHAIR POWELL. You know, yes. I mean, if you're looking-if-we, we can tell how much inflation has gone up in a given month, right? And, you know, that's what we're looking at. And month by month, what's the reading? And, you know, I think-I think what we're really looking at is, there's a tendency to look at, you know, shorter and shorter maturities, but they're incredibly volatile, and they can be misleading. That's why we look at 12-month [rates]. But I think, in this situation-where it looks like we've had a bit of a turn in inflation starting in June-we're also looking at six months, and even three months, but really six months' inflation. So you're looking at it over that period and over longer periods. That-that's the right way to go. And we don't-we don't need to be in a hurry to-in, in getting to a conclusion about what to do. We can let the data evolve. So- MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thanks for the question, Chair Powell. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business. So I want to focus back in on oil prices. We're seeing oil prices, as you mentioned, move up, and that's pushing the price of gas. So how does that factor into your decision to raise rates or not-because in the last two inflation reports, PCE and CPI, we've seen, the overall inflation has actually risen? CHAIR POWELL. Right. So, you know, energy prices are very important for the consumer. This, this can affect consumer spending. It certainly can affect consumer sentiment. I mean, gas prices are one of the big things that, that affects consumer sentiment. It, it really comes down to how persistent-how sustained these energy prices are. The reason why we look at core inflation, which excludes food and energy, is that energy goes up and down like that. And it doesn't-energy, energy prices mostly, mostly don't contain much of a signal about how tight the economy is, and hence don't tell you much about where inflation's really going. However, we're well aware, though, that, that, you know, if energy prices increase and stay high, that'll have an effect on spending. And, and it may have an effect on, on consumer expectations of inflation-things like that. That's just things we have to monitor. EDWARD LAWRENCE. On the consumer-they're putting more and more of this on their credit card. The consumer is seeing, you know, record credit spending. How long do you think the consumer can manage that debt at higher interest rates now? And are you concerned about a, a debt bubble related to that? CHAIR POWELL. So, to, to finish my prior thought, I was saying that's why we tend to look through energy moves that we-that we can see as, as short-term volatility. You know, turning to consumer credit, you know-of course, we watch that carefully. Consumer distress-measures of distress among consumers were at historic lows quite recently, you know, after-during and after the, the pandemic. They're now moving back up to normal. We're, we're watching that carefully. But, at this point, these, these readings are not at troublingly high levels. They're, they're just kind of moving back up to what was the typical [level] in the pre-pandemic era. MICHELLE SMITH. Jean. JEAN YUNG. Hi. Jean Yung with MNI Market News. Yields along the Treasury curve have risen to their highest in years. What is the Fed's view about what's been driving that increase in recent weeks, and how much of it can be attributed to macro explanations-and how much to technical factors? CHAIR POWELL. So you're right. You know, rates have moved up significantly. I think it's always hard to say precisely, but it's-most, most people do a common decomposition of the increase, and they'll, they'll-the view will be, it's not-it's not mostly about inflation expectations. It's mostly about other things, you know-either term premium or real yields-and it's, it's hard to be precise about this. Of course, everyone's got models that'll give you a very precise answer, but they give you different answers. So-but, essentially, they're, they're moving up because-it's not because of inflation. It's because probably-it'll probably have something to do with stronger growth, I would say-more, more supply of Treasuries. You know, the common explanations that you hear in the markets kind of make sense. MICHELLE SMITH. Kyle. KYLE CAMPBELL. Kyle Campbell, American Banker. Thank you for taking the questions-just two on, on housing. You've said slower shelter cost growth is in the pipeline and will reflect in inflation readings as new leases are signed, but there's also some questions out there about the way housing costs are measured, particularly the use of rental equivalents, which are estimates from homeowners about what their homes would rent for if they were in the rental market. So my question is, how much of the effort to tame inflation, both as it's measured and felt by the broader public, hinges on housing supply? And then as far as a constrained housing supply being sort of exacerbated by this sort of lock-in effect of mortgages being higher now than they were at their recent historic lows, how is that going to impact future thinking about taking interest rates to that lower bound in the future? CHAIR POWELL. So on the supply point-of course, supply is very important over time in, in setting house prices and, and, for that matter, rents. And so-and supply is kind of structurally constrained. But in terms of, of where inflation's going in the near term, though, as, as you obviously know, a lot of it is, is leases that are running off and then being re-signed or re-leased at a level that's, that's not as-it won't be that much higher. A year ago, it would have been much higher than it was a year before; now it may be below or at the same level. So as those leases are rolling over, we're, we're seeing what we expect, which is measured housing services inflation coming down. Your second question was the lock-ins. How much is that affecting things, really? KYLE CAMPBELL. Is that going to affect your decisions to potentially bring rates down to their lower bound in the future, sort of creating that sort of bubble of buying and then a lock-in that sort of stagnates the housing market? CHAIR POWELL. I, I think we look at the-I would look at the lock-in, the, the idea being that people are in, in very low mortgage-very low-rate mortgages, and if-even if they want to move now, they-it would be hard because the new mortgage would be so expensive. And that's explaining some of the-that's one of the explanations for what's happening broadly in the labor market. Would that play a role in, in our future decisions-in a-in a future tight-in a future loosening cycle about whether we would cut rates? No, I, I don't think it would. I mean, I don't think that's-I, I think we'd be looking at, what, you know, fundamentally, what, what rates does the economy need? And, and, you know, in, in an emergency like the pandemic or during the Global Financial Crisis, you, you know, the, the-you have to cut rates to the point that-you have to do, do what you can to support the economy. So I wouldn't-I wouldn't think that that would be a reason for us not to do that. It's not something we're thinking about at all right now. But, down the road, I wouldn't think so. MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. Chair Powell, you've mentioned several things that would possibly weigh on consumer confidence, maybe cut back consumer spending-possible government shutdown, high gas prices. At this point, would the Fed welcome a decrease in consumer spending? Would that help you get inflation closer to your 2 percent target? CHAIR POWELL. I, I wouldn't say it that way. We're not looking for a decrease in consumer spending. It's, it's a good thing that the economy's strong. It's a good thing that the economy has been able to hold up under, under the tightening that we've done. It's a good thing that the labor market's strong. The, the only concern-it, it just means this: If the economy comes in stronger than expected, that just means we'll have to do more in terms of monetary policy to get back to 2 percent-because we will get back to 2 percent. Does that answer your question? NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Yeah. And I guess, on the other hand, would you worry that that could contribute to an economic slowdown or even a recession? CHAIR POWELL. Well, that's always a concern. I mean, concern number one is, is restoring price stability, because in the long run, that's, that's something we have to do so that we can have the kind of economy we really want, which is one with sustained period of tight labor market conditions that benefit all, as I-as I've said a couple times. So that, that said-of course, you know-we, we also now, given how far we've come with our rate hikes and how quickly we've come here, we do have the ability to be careful as we move forward because of that consideration. MICHELLE SMITH. Simon. SIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the Economist. One of the factors in the economic resilience to date appears to be a lesser degree of rate sensitivity than in the past. Obviously, we've talked about households with long fixed-rate mortgages-also companies that refinanced before last year. What is your thinking about the efficacy of rates and how that's changed? And then, related to that, how do you think about the distributional consequences in the sense that if you're a relatively wealthy household with a long fixed-rate mortgage, the past year has not been all that tough with rates going up, whereas if you're relying on your credit card for supporting your consumption, in fact, times are getting a lot tougher a lot more quickly? Thanks. CHAIR POWELL. So, what-I guess it's fair-it's fair to say that the economy has been stronger than many expected, given, given what's been happening with, with interest rates. Why is that? Many candidate explanations-possibly-a number of them make sense. One, one is just that household balance sheets and business balance sheets have been stronger than we had understood, and so that, that spending has held up-and that kind of thing. We're not sure about that. The savings rate for consumers has come down a lot. The question is whether that's sustainable. That could-it could just mean that the-that the date of effect is, is later. It could also be that for other reasons, the neutral rate of interest is, is higher for-for various reasons. We don't know that. It could also just be that policy hasn't been restrictive enough for long enough. And it's-there are many candidate explanations. We have to, in, in all this uncertainty, make policy, and I, you know, I feel like what we have right now is what's still a very strong labor market-but that's coming back into balance. We were making progress on inflation. Growth is strong. But I think by many forecasts-many, many, many forecasts call for growth to, to moderate over the course of the next year. So that's where we are, and, you know, we have to-we have to deal with what comes. On your second question, which was-sorry, your second question was distributional, but can you-can you be a little clearer about that? SIMON RABINOVITCH. Yeah. My point there was that if you're somebody who has a long fixed-rate mortgage, you've been able to endure the higher rates relatively easily. If you're somebody who's living month to month off of your credit card, current financing rates are, are punitive. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. And so the point I would make there is that we're trying to get inflation back down. The people who are most hurt by inflation are the people who are on a fixed income. If you're a person who spends all of your income, you don't really have any meaningful savings. You spend all your income on the basics of life-clothing, food, transportation, heating-the basics-and prices go up by 5, 6, 7 percent, you're in trouble right away, whereas even, even middle-class people have some savings and some ability to absorb that. So it is for those people as much as for anybody that we need to restore price stability, and, and we, we want to do it as quickly as possible. Obviously, we-we'd like to do that. We'd like the current trend to continue, which is that we're making progress without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that we've seen past-in past things. But you're right, though. When we raise rates, people who are, you know, living on credit cards and, and borrowing are going to feel that more. They are. And, of course, people with, with lots of savings also have a-have a much lower marginal propensity to consume, and so they're not going to-it's not going to affect them as much. MICHELLE SMITH. Let's go to Greg Robb for the last question. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the Beige Book recently, you can tell that the Fed has been surveying nonprofits and community groups about the economic health of low-income Americans-moderate-income Americans. I have two questions about this. Are you going to use that data to maybe come up with sort of like a quarterly survey of those groups-like the senior loan officer survey? And from your-and also the second question is, from your recent look-readings of these surveys, how are low and moderate Americans doing? Is there this thing where, like, the GDP is strong because of wealthy Americans kind of driving things? I just want to get your sense of the health of that sector. Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. So I, I don't know about the quarterly survey. That's an idea we can-we can take away and think about. In terms of how low and moderate Americans-you know, they're clearly-were suffering from, from high inflation. I think during the pandemic, the, the government transfers that happened were very meaningful. And, you know, if you know the-the surveys that we take showed that-showed that low- and moderate-income people were actually in very, very strong financial condition. I think now it's a very ""hot"" labor market, and you're seeing high [growth in] nominal wages, and you're starting to see [that growth rates of] real wages are now positive by most-by most measures. So I, I think, overall, households are in good shape. Surveys are a different thing. So surveys are showing dissatisfaction, and I think a lot of that is just, people hate inflation-hate it. And that, that causes people to say, ""The economy's terrible."" But, at the same time, they're spending money. Their behavior is, is not exactly what you would expect from the surveys. That's kind of a, a guess at what the answer might be. But I, I think there's a lot of good things happening on household balance sheets-and, certainly, in the labor market and with wages. The biggest wage increases having gone to relatively low-wage jobs-and now [with] inflation coming down-you're seeing [increases in] real wages, which is a good thing. Thanks very much."

Howard uh Howard Schneider Withers uh thank you uh chair pal for doing this U to what you referen the rise in long-term Bon yelds to what degree did that supplant action by the FED at this meeting thanks for your question so um I'll talk about bond yields but I want to take a second and just sort of set the broader context in which we're we're looking at that so if if you look at the situation let's look at the economy first inflation has been coming down but it's still running well above our 2% Target the labor market has been rebalancing but it's still very tight by many measures GDP growth has been strong although many forecasters are forecasting and they have been forecasting that it will slow as for the committee we are committed to achieving a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time and we're not confident yet that we have achieved such a stance so that is the broader context into which this the strong economy and all the things I said that's the context in which we're looking at this question uh of race so um obviously we're monitoring we're attentive to the increase in longer term yields and which have contributed to a tightening of broader Financial conditions since the summer as I mentioned persistent changes in broader Financial conditions can have implications for the path of monetary policy in this case the tighter Financial conditions we're seeing from higher long-term rates but also from other sources like the stronger dollar and and lower Equity prices could matter for future rate decisions as long as two two conditions are satisfied the first is that the tighter conditions would need to be persistent and uh that is something that remains to be seen um but that's critical we're you know things are fluctuating back and forth that's not what we're looking for with financial conditions we're looking for persistent changes that are material the second thing is that that that the the longer term rates that have moved up they can't simply be a reflection of of expected policy moves from us that we would then that if we didn't follow through on them then then then the rat would come back down so the and I would say on that it does not appear that an expectation of higher near-term policy rates is causing the increase in longer term rates so um in the meantime though uh perhaps the most important thing is that these higher treasury yields are showing through the higher borrowing cost for households and businesses and those higher costs are going to weigh on economic activity to the extent this tightening persists and you know the the Mind's Eye goes to the 8% near 8% mortgage rate which which could have you know pretty significant effect on housing so that's how I would answer your question just as a quick following to be clear on this um in your opening statement and just now I you seem to imply that you are not yet confident that Financial conditions are restrictive enough to to finish the fight is that true yes that's exactly right um you know to say it a different way we haven't made any decisions about about future meetings um we have not made the determination uh and we're not I will say that we're we're not confident at this time that we've reached such a stance we're not confident that we haven't we're not confident that we have and that's that is is the way we're going to be going into these future meetings is to be you know determining the extent of any additional further policy M uh tightening that that may be appropriate to return inflation at 2% over time Gina hi chair pal thank you so much for taking our questions I wonder you know if you don't raise interest rates in December would the presumption be that at that point that we should expect that rates are at their Peak or is there a possibility of restarting rate increases next year and are there any costs to taking a more extended pause so um let me start by saying we haven't made it decision about September you're asking hypothetical there but but we're going into this sever meeting we'll get as you know two more inflation readings two more uh labor market readings some data on uh on economic activity uh and so we'll be taking and also the broader situation the broader Financial conditions situation and and the broader World situation we'll be looking at all those things as we make a decision in December we haven't made that decision I would say though that that uh the idea that if you the the idea that you wouldn't would be difficult to to raise again after stopping for a meeting or two is just not right I mean the committee will always do what it what it thinks is appropriate at the time and again we haven't made any decisions about at all about December we didn't even we didn't talk about making a decision in December today really it was a decision for this meeting and and understanding broader things Nick Nick timos of the Wall Street Journal uh chair Powell did the FED staff put a re s back into the Baseline forecast uh in the materials for today's meeting and how much does this tightening and financial conditions substitute for rate hikes if the tightening is persistent you had said it was worth maybe a quarter point when we had the bank failures in the spring what is it here on something that's presumably more straightforward and more familiar to simulate so I guess uh I don't want to answer your question about the um about the recession but the answer is no I think I have to answer it since we since we did publicly say in the minutes you'll you'll know anyway in the minutes the staff did not put our session back in I mean it would be hard to see how you would do that if you look at the um look at the activity we've seen recently which is not really indicative of a recession in the near term in terms of um how to think about translation into rate hikes I think it's it's just too early to be doing that and the main reason is we just don't know how persistent this will be you can see how volatile it is different kinds of news will affect the level of rates and I think any kind of an estimate that was you know precise would hang out there and have a great chance of looking wrong very quickly so I think what we can say is that Financial conditions have have clearly tightened and you can see that in the rates that that consumers and house and households and businesses are paying now and over time that will have an effect we just don't know how persistent it's going to be and and it's tough to try to translate that in a way that I'd be comfortable communicating into how many rate hikes that is if I could follow up I guess what makes you confident that tighter what makes you confident that tighter Financial conditions will slow above Trend growth when 500 basis points of rate hikes QT and a minor banking crisis have not thus far well I just that that's U uh you know the way our policy works is and sometimes it works with lags of course which can be long and variable But ultimately if you if you raise the you know raise interest rates you do see the those effects and you see those effects in the economy now you see what's happening in the housing market you're seeing that now you you'll see uh if you look at surveys of people it's not a good time they think to buy durable goods of various kinds because rates are so high now I mentioned again we're we're getting reports from housing that the effects of this of this could be quite significant but you're right the this has been a resilient economy and it's I think been surprising in its resilience and there are there number of possible reasons why that may be um our job is to is to is to achieve maximum employment and price stability and so we take the economy as it comes it has been resilient uh so we just uh we take it as it is Colby thank you Colby Smith with the financial times in terms of the thresholds that you've laid out um of what could warrant further tightening um the additional evidence of persistently above Trend growth or some kind of reversal in the recent easing of Labor Market tightness that seems to suggest something more powerful than just one more quarter point rate hike would be necessary and I'm just curious if if that's how the the committee sees it so we've identified those factors those those are not meant to be the only factors or a specific test that we're going to be applying with with some metrics behind it really we're going to be looking at the broader picture and you know what's happening with our progress to toward the 2% inflation goal is the labor market continuing to broadly cool off and achieve a a better balance so we looking at that you know growth we look at growth in so far as it as has implications for our two mandate goals we look at that and we look at broader Financial conditions so we'll be looking at all of those things as we reach a judgment uh you know whether we need to further Titan policy and if we do reach that judgment then we will further tighten policy okay and and just in terms of the tightening of financial conditions if that is having some kind of offsetting um effect in terms of the need to potentially again raise rates what then is the potential impact on the trajectory of of rate Cuts could we see those maybe pulled forward or have to see um more than than what the September sep indicated so it's it's the fact is the committee is not thinking about rate Cuts right now at all we're not talking about rate Cuts we're still very focused on the first question which is have we have we achieved a stance of monetary policy that's sufficiently restrictive to bring bring inflation down to 2% over time sustainably that is the question we're focusing on but the next question as you know will be for how long will we remain restrictive what policy remain restrictive and what we said there is that we we'll keep policy restrictive until we're confident that inflation is is on a sustainable path down to 2% that'll be the next question but honestly right now we're really tightly focused on the first question the question of rates Cuts just just doesn't come up because I think it the first it's so important to get that first question you know as as close to right as you can C Steve lean CNBC Mr chairman I guess I had assumed that there was a tightening bias in the committee you say in the statement you're looking to assess the appropriate stand of monetary policy uh the extent to which uh you may you may need to hike Additionally you you didn't say earlier that you were sufficiently restrictive there were forecast for two rate hikes among most members of the committee but then you just said that you know we're we don't we haven't determination would you say the bias right now is neutral that there is no disposition to hike again and that the committee largely has moved off of this forecast for two hikes or for sorry one additional hi I about one addition no I I wouldn't say that at all I would say I mean the language you know looking at it here uh in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation 2% over time that's the question we're asking so is it right to think of that as a a hiking bias is still in the committee here we haven't used that term but it's fair to say that's the question we're asking is should we hike more it's not it's not you know and that that is the question and you're right that in September we wrote down one additional raid hike but you know we'll write down another forecast as you know in December Chris uh thank you Chris rugaber at Associated Press um well since the last meeting the Auto Workers strike has finished uh oil prices have leveled off uh and yet on the other hand you have the outbreak of war between uh Israel and Hamas how do you see all those factors taken together affecting the economy uh going forward how are you thinking about those um so there are significant issues out there as you as you point out um Global uh geopolitical tensions are certainly elevated and that goes for the war in Ukraine it goes for the war between Israel and Hamas uh we're monitoring that our job is to monitor those things for their economic uh implications um so the UAW strike as you point out is is um uh appears to be coming to an end oil prices have flattened out they haven't gone down but I guess they've gone down a little bit from their earlier Peak um another one is the the possibility of government shutdown we don't know about that one so there's plenty of of risk out there um but I I would go back to the you know the bigger picture for from our standpoint is is got a very strong economy strong labor market making progress on the labor market making progress on inflation and um we're very focused on getting confident that we have achieved a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive that's really our Focus great and just one quick thing you uh last month had gone to York Pennsylvania where you talked to a lot of or yeah last month where you talked to a lot of small business owners just curious what sentiments did you hear from them or what did you picked up on and what would you was there anything that surprised you the most in terms of what they talked about I wouldn't say I was terribly surprised I was I was very impressed by uh York as a town with a real strategy and I would say it's it's very impressive what the people there uh have have put together uh in the face of you know some difficult longer run Trends about offshoring of manufacturing and that kind of thing they've they've done a great job as a as a city I think you know what you hear and it's is consistent there which is people are really suffering under high inflation you were there we talked to some people who you know were feeling that in their businesses and other people who are feeling it in their home lives as well you know it's it's painful for people particularly people who you know who don't have a lot of extra Financial Resources who are spending most of their incoming uh you know income on uh the essentials of life so we know that that that wasn't new but that did come through very clearly uh in in in the conversations we had in New York and you know I I walked away from that even you know I mean just thinking that that we really the the best thing we can do for the US is to restore price stability uh fully restore price stability and not fail in that task and do it as quickly as possible but but also with the least damage we we can Rachel hi chair pal Rachel seagull from The Washington Post thanks for taking our questions you've spoken before about the pain that would likely be coming for the economy in order to get inflation down but since the economy has not responded to rate hikes in ways that would normally be expected have you changed your views on that at all on how necessary or enevitable that kind of pain would be say for the labor market or overall growth well I think everyone has been very gratified to see that we've been able to achieve you know pretty significant progress on inflation without seeing the kind of increase in unemployment that has been very typical of rate hiking Cycles like this one so that's that's a historically unusual and and very welcome result and the same is true of growth you know we've we've been saying that we need to see below potential growth and growth has been strong but yet we're still seeing this I think I still believe and my colleagues for the most part I think still believe that it is likely to be true it is still likely to be true not a certainty but likely that we will need to see some slower growth and some softening in the labor market in labor market conditions to get to you know to to fully restore price stability so but it's a it's only a good thing that we haven't seen it and I think we know why you know since since we lift it off we we have understood that there are really two processes at work here one of them one of which is the unwinding of the distortions to both supply and demand from the pandemic and the response to the pandemic and the other is is you know restrictive monetary policy which is moderating demand and giving the supply side time to time to recover time and space to recover so you see those two forces now working together to bring down inflation but it's that that first one can bring down inflation without the need for higher unemployment or slower growth it's just it's Supply you know supply side improvements like um shortages and bottlenecks and that kind of thing going away it's getting you know a significant increase in the size of the labor market now both from labor force participation and from immigration that's a big supply side you know gain that is really helping the economy it's part of why part of why GDP is so high is because we're getting that that Supply so we welcome that um but I think those things will run their course and we're probably still going to be left we think and I think still be left with a with some ground to cover to get back to full price stability and and that's where monetary policy and and what we do in with demand is is still going to be important I'm curious against that backdrop if you've gotten any Clarity on lags if you have an economy that's been so resilient to high rate increases does that suggest to you that there isn't necessarily this huge wave of tightening that's still coming through the pipeline and that it may have already come into effect you know I I continue to think it's very hard to say so it's it's been one year at this meeting one year ago this was the fourth of our 75 five basis points hike hikes so that's a full year since then I think we are seeing the effects of of all the hiking we did last year and and this year we're seeing it it's very hard to know exactly what that might be but you can for example an example of where where you wouldn't have felt this yet is is debt that had been termed out uh but it's going to come due and have to get rolled over next year or the year after so and they little things like that where the effects are just taking time to get into the economy so I don't uh I I think we have to make monetary policy under great uncertainty about how long the lags are I think trying to make a clear get a clear answer and say I'm just going to assume this is really not a good way to do it and this is one of the reasons why we have slowed the process down this year was to give monetary policy time to get into the economy and it takes time we know that and you can't rush it so doing slowing down is giving us I think a better sense of of how much more we need to do if we need to do more Mich Michael mcke from Bloomberg television and radio um I'm trying to connect the dots here um one quick clarification I want to ask about um Rachel's question is you said you need slower growth you had always said before a period of lower uh than Trend growth uh has that changed and two it sounds to me like uh you're basically saying here that the kind of the dot plots out the window that every meeting is live with the possibility of a rate increase for right now doesn't matter about the turn of the uh the year and that there's not an objective way to determine whether or not you've got enough uh tightening in the system it's just going to be a subjective judgment meeting by meeting well so let's talk about the dotplot first so the dotplot is a is a a picture in time of what the people in the committee thinks is likely to be a appropriate monetary policy in light of their own personal economic forecast in principle when things change it's not that's not like a plan that anybody's agreed to or that we will do that's a forecast that would change for example I mean many things could change that would cause people to say I wouldn't write down that dot you know six weeks later think of the number of things that could change your mind on that so I think I think the the efficacy of the Dot Plot probably decays over the 3mon period between that meeting and the next next meeting but nonetheless it's it's out there and we don't we do personally update our forecast but we don't formally update the dotplot so you know I I think we try to be as transparent as we can about the way we're thinking about these things we we're we're laying out there our thinking and you know as we approach the meeting we'll we'll all be you know my colleagues and I will be talking about how we're processing that data in terms of so I we're not really changing the way in terms of uh growth uh what I said was below potential so what you have here recently is growth that is that is um temporarily potential growth is elevated for a year or two right now over its Trend level so the right way to think about it is what's potential growth this year Tren people think Trend growth over a long period of time is a little bit less than 2% or I would say just around 2% but um what we've had is with with the you know Improvement in the size of the labor force as I me through both participation and uh immigration and with the the you know the better functioning in the labor market and with with the you know the unwinding of the supply chain and shortages and those kinds of things you're seeing actually elevated potential growth there's catch-up growth that can happen in potential and that means that if you're grow you could be growing at 2% this year and still be glowing growing below the increase in the potential output of the economy that I hope that's clear that's really what's going on that's that's why I would say say it as below potential but if you could uh clarify what I asked about the meeting by meeting we essentially now supposed to assume that it's a meeting by meeting live meeting with a chance of a rate increase that will be decided on uh subjective uh criteria rather than objective at each meeting I yeah I mean I I don't know that I want to just accept anybody's characterization it I'll I'll tell you how we're doing this so we're going meeting by meeting we're asking ourselves whether we've achieved a stance of policy that is sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time that's the question we're asking we're looking at the full range of economic data including Financial conditions and all of those things that we look at and then we're we're you know we we we've we've come very far with this rate hiking cycle very far and you saw the spread at in at the September meeting of you know it's a relatively small spread of people think one or two additional hikes so you're close to the to the end of the cycle that's that was an impression as of a belief as of September it's not a promise or a plan of the future and so we're going into these meetings one by one we're looking at the data as I mentioned we're also you know we've we're being we're being careful we're proceeding carefully because we can proceed carefully at this time monetary policy is restrictive we see its effects on particularly an interest in sensitive spending and other channels so that's how I think about it NE thanks uh hi chair pal Neil irn with axios um in light of the runup and long-term yields we've seen the last several weeks uh have you given any consideration to the pace of your asset runoff program uh and if there were a judgment that high that the higher term premium was endangering the Dual mandate goals would that be reason to think about slowing or suspending qt or should we think of that as more of a technical question around reserves so committee is not considering uh changing the pace of balance sheet runoff it's not something we're talking about or considering um and I I know there there are many candidate explanations for why rates have been going up uh and QT is certainly on that list it may be playing a relatively small effect although I would say at $3.3 trillion in reserves it's not I think I think it's hard to make a case that reserves are even close to scarce at this point so that's not something that we're that we're looking at right now Victoria hi uh Victoria Guido with Politico I wanted to ask about the bosel 3 uh endgame Capital proposal uh you know you've gotten a lot of push back from people on different aspects of the proposal and you yourself expressed some reservations and I'm just curious um could you accept finalizing that proposal without significant changes so that proposal is out for comment and uh we expect a lot of comment we won't get those comments until the end of uh until well into next year you know we've extended the deadline and we'll take them serious seriously we'll read them I'll say what what I do expect is that we will we will come to we're a consensus-driven organization we'll come to a package that that has broad support on the board so does broad support mean more support than the proposal had it means broad support Janelle Marte with Bloomberg so um in addition to persist when you look at long-term treasury yields what else are you watching to evaluate how those tighter Financial conditions are hitting the economy and if it will lessen the need for further tightening also do you think that those higher yields could affect um banking stress so what do we look at we look at a very wide range of financial conditions in fact as as you'll know uh uh different organizations publish different Financial conditions indexes which can have you know seven or eight variables or they can have 100 variables so there's a there's a very rich environment and we we tend to look at a few of them I'm not going to give you the names but they you know there few of the common ones that people look at and so they're looking at things like the level of the dollar the level of equity prices uh the level of rates the credit spreads sometimes uh they're they're pulling in credit availability and things like that so it isn't any one thing we would never look at for example long-term treasury rates in isolation uh nor will we ignore them but we would look at them ASO as part of a broader picture and they do play a role of course in in many uh of the major standard uh Financial condition indexes your second question was on the banking stress uh banking stress so it's something we're watching as you know we we did have um there were issues with interest rate risk uh and also um you know funding uninsured deposits uh uh in in the March the things we went through in March and thereafter and so we've been working a lot with financial institutions to make sure that they have uh good funding plans and good and uh and that they have a plan for how to deal with with um you know the kind of portfolio unrealized losses that they have we do think the banking system is is quite resilient we we had you know a handful of bank failures but uh so that's that's what we're out there doing and um we don't have any to think that this that these R Hecks uh are materially changing that picture which is one of a strong banking system and one where there's a a strong focus by Banks and by supervisors on liquidity on funding and those sorts of things Scott thanks Mr chairman Scott horley from MPR last week you and your colleagues put forward a proposal to lower the cap on debit card swipe fees for for comment could you just talk a little about uh the considerations there what it would mean for merchants for banks for consumers and also just what y'all are seeing in terms of the use of both debit and credit cards in the in the payment system you know so you're right we we we put a proposal out for comment is what we did and you know this is this is a job that Congress assigned us as as you of course know uh in Dodd Frank and all we can really do is Faithfully implement the statute that's that's all we're trying to do what else can we really do um it's a 90-day comment period we typically don't comment on these things once they're out for out for comment and we do hope that stakeholders and we know that they will use this opportunity to express their views they haven't been shy about that so that's that's critical and that's that's what I can say about that now thank you thanks chair uh Edward Lawrence with Fox Business so over the last um three months the year-over-year PC inflation was at 3.4% core well over 3% you've said in the past 2% Remains the Federal Reserve Target but with with no rate increase today how long would you be okay then with a 3% or 3% plus overall inflation you know the the progress is probably going to come in lumps and be bumpy but we're making progress you know I think I think the core pce came down by almost 60 basis points in the third quarter so if you the best thing I could point to you too would be the U September SCP where you know the expectation was that that inflation by the end of next year on a 12 12-month trailing basis would be well into the twos and the year after that further into the twos so that's that's if you look historically that's that's sort of consistent with the way inflation comes down it does take some time and as you get you know as you get U further and further from those highs it may actually take longer time but the good good news is we're you know we're making progress and monetary policy is restrictive and we feel like we're on a path uh to make more progress and it's essential that we do well you've said in the past that doing too little on interest rates could take years to fix but the cost of doing too much could be easily fixed how robust was the debate about this pause on the doing too little side that's always the the question we're asking ourselves and um we know that if we if we fail to restore price stability the risk is that expectations of higher inflation get entrenched in the economy and we know that that's really bad for people inflation will be both more High both higher and more volatile that's that's a prescription for misery and and so we're really committed to not letting that happen um you know for the first year or so of our tightening cycle the risk was all on the side of not doing enough we're you know we're we've come far enough that that the risks you know have gotten more two-sided you can't identify that with a lot of precision but it does feel like the the risks are are more two-sided now now um and um but we're we're committed to getting inflation back down to our Target over time and we will Simon uh Simon orbovich with the economist um quick followup to the question about banking stresses uh you talked about how the banking system is resilient uh of course part of the resilience the past year stems from the the bank term funding program that you launched in March um given that bond prices have not recovered that unrealized losses are probably mounting how like is it that you might have to extend that program uh in March next year um good question we're we haven't really we haven't really been thinking about that yet we uh um you know it's it's November one and that's a decision we'll be making in the first quarter of next year okay um sorry quick separate question about uh inflation expectations the U Michigan sentiment survey showed a big jump in one year ahead inflation expectations last month from 3.2 to 4.2 last year you said that particular survey was a really decisive factor in one of your rate hike decisions uh if it stays elevated uh next time around how big of an input will that be into your December thinking yeah we we look at a a range of of things uh I I think the the you know the um thing got blown out of proportion a little bit it was actually a preliminary estimate that got revised away and and I said it was preliminary in it but that didn't get picked up so uh we we look at many many things and so really look across the broad array of surveys and also market-based estimates and you know and we do that really carefully at every meeting and between meetings you know there there's it's just clear that inflation expectations are in a good place the public does believe that that inflation will get back down to 2% over time and uh and it will they're right so uh and there's no real crack in that in that armor you can always find one reading that is a little bit out of whack but but honestly the bulk of them are are just very clear that that uh the public believes that inflation will come down and that's of course we we believe that's critical in winning the battle hi chair pal Megan castella with baren thanks for taking our questions I wanted to see if you could talk about the neutral rate you mentioned today that you're still debating whether rates are sufficiently restrictive and you've recently said that um evidence of suggesting policy is not too tight right now so I was curious if you could elaborate on that at all and whether that means the neutral rate in your view has risen yeah um so first thing to say is that it's very important it's a very important variable in in the way we think about monetary policy but you can't identify it with any Precision in real time and we know that so you have to just take that you have to take your estimate of it with a grain of salt um what we know now is you know within a range of estimates of the neutral rate policy policy is is uh is restrictive uh and it's therefore putting downward pressure on economic activity hiring and inflation so we do we do talk about this there's there's not any debate or you know attempt to you know to sort of agree as a group on what whether our star has moved or not some people think it has some people haven't said that don't think it has ultimately it's it's unknowable and so really again what we're focused on is you know looking at the data and giving ourselves a little more time now to look carefully at the data by being careful in in our moves does it does it feel like monetary policy restrictive enough to bring inflation down to 2% over time that's the question we're asking ourselves um I think you know years from now economists will be revising their estimates of of rstar as it existed on November 1 2023 you can't we can't really wait for that in making policy we have to look we have to we have to have those models and look at them and think about them but ultimately we've got to look at the effects of that policiy having accounting for the lags which makes it difficult if I could follow up on a wages Point earlier you talked about the inflation Outlook but I'm curious if you have any concerns whether wage inflation um at its current level could be could risk pushing up overall inflation or reacceleration so if you look at the look at the broad range of wages um they have all the in wage increases have really come down significantly over the course of the last 18 months to a level where they're substantially closer to that level that would be consistent with 2% inflation over time making standard assumptions bet productivity over time so it's much closer than it was uh and that's true of the ECI which is the one that's one that we got this week it's true of um average hourly earnings and compensation per hour too so and all of them are kind of saying that which is great you have to look at a group of them because any one of them can be idiosyncratic from in any given reading so that's what you see uh and so what you saw with the ECI reading was if you look if you look back a couple comes out four times a year if you look back a couple of quarters you'll see it was much higher and then it came down substantially in June and then the September reading was more or less at the same level as the June reading so in a way it's just validating that Decline and it was very close to our expectations internally too so I think we feel good about that also I would say it it isn't in my thinking it's not the case that that wages have been the Principal driver of inflation um so far although I I think it's all I do think it's fair to say that as we go forward as monetary policy becomes more important relative to the supply side issues I talked about in the unwinding of the pandemic effects it may be that that the the labor market has becomes more important over time too Nancy hi Nancy Marshall genser with Marketplace um chair Paul are you now as concerned about overshooting and raising interest rates too much as you are about getting inflation down to the 2% Target so I I as I mentioned um I think for much of the last year and a half the concern was not doing too much too too not doing enough it was not getting rates high enough in time to avoid having inflation expectations higher inflation expectations become entrenched so that was the concern I think we've reached you know now more than 18 months into this you can see by the fact that we have slowed down although that we're still we're still we're still trying to gain confidence in in what the appropriate stance is but you can see that um we think and I think that the risks are are getting more balanced I'll just say that they're getting more balanced the risk of doing too much versus the risk of doing too little or getting are getting more closer to balance because policy is clear I think clearly restrictive at 5 and a quarter to 5 and a half percent that that range you're if you you take off a a mainstream estimate of the of the U expected inflation take one-year inflation you're going to see that you're going to see a real policy rate that is you know well above mainstream estimates of of a neutral policy rate now that's that's arithmetic it doesn't really what the proof is really in how the economy reacts but I I would say that we're we're in a place where where those risks are getting closer to being inbalance and you said the proof is how the economy reacts what are you looking at to be sure you're not overshooting well I think what we're looking at is are are we still is inflation still broadly cooling do we is it sort of validating the the the path we saw over the summer uh where inflation was clearly Cooling and coming down now we've seen periods like that before and they've just that there hasn't been follow through the data have bounced back so what are we seeing you know are we seeing is inflation still coming down so that's the the first thing second thing is in the labor market um what we've seen is a a very positive rebalancing of supply and demand partly through just much more Supply coming on online and and with with labor demand still clearly remaining very strong when you're when when you have the kind of job growth we've had over the last quarter it's still very strong demand so and you see wage increases coming down as we we discussed but coming out coming down you know in a kind of gradual way um I think that's we want to see that that whole set of processes continue Brian thank you Brian man CNN um uh do you think that there's has been any structural change in either consumption or in the job market that's uh pushing up consumption uh you obviously saw the third quarter GDP figures which were strong and some economists have expected Revenge spending to fizzled out by now so I'm kind of wondering if uh there's been any structural change in consumption um I wouldn't say there's been a structural change in consumption I would say it's certainly um been strong and so a couple of things we may have underestimated the the balance sheet strength of households and small businesses and that may be part of it um there may be you know we've been like everyone else trying to estimate the number of the amount of savings that that U that households have from the pandemic when they couldn't spend on Services really at all or you know in person services and you know there can still be more of that than we think although at a certain point we have to we're going to be getting back to prepandemic levels of savings we may not be there yet so things are for clearly people are still spending the dynamic has been really strong job creation with now wages that are that are higher than inflation in the aggregate anyway and that raises real disposable income and that raises spending which continues to drive more hiring and so you've had a really that that whole that whole dynamic has been and also at the same time um the pandemic effects are wearing off so that Goods availability automobile availability is better or was better I think it still is and there and from a from a business standpoint there more people to hire and you know there more labor Supply so the whole thing has led to more growth more spending and that kind of thing and it's been you know it's been good and and the thing is we've been achieving progress on inflation in the middle of this so um it's it's been a a dynamic the question is how long can that continue and you know I just think this the existence of this second set of factors at this time which is the unwinding of the pandemic effects that's what makes this cycle uh unique I think and you know we're still learning uh it that that to took longer for that Pro process to begin than we thought and we're still learning about how it plays out that's that's all we can do so Daniel for the last question [Music] thank you chair pal um Daniel AIS from uh a FR press um just a quick question following up uh on an earlier one um uh with regards to the Israel uh Hamas conflict um you know uh the fed's financial stability report said the isra Hamas conflict and the conflict in Ukraine pose important risks to global economic activity including the possibility of sustain disruptions to regional trade in food energy and other Commodities you've had organizations like the the World Bank warning of possible uh you know surge in oil prices if the War uh spreads to other countries in the region I'm just wondering how the FED is monitoring these developments in the Middle East you mentioned they are and and and just what you know the potential economic impact could be if the conflict does spread to other countries in the region thank you H I wouldn't want to speculate too much but I'll just say so you know really the question there is does the war spread more widely and does it start to do things like affect oil prices in particular since this is the Middle East we're talking about the price of oil has really not reacted very much so far to this as you know as the FED as as the Federal Open Market Committee our job is really to talk about to understand the economy and the economic effects and it's it isn't clear at this point that the conflict in the Middle East is going to is on track to have significant economic effects that doesn't mean it isn't incredibly important and and something for people to you know to take take great really important notice of but it may or may not turn out to be something that matters for the Federal Open Market Committee as an economic body but the what so what the financial stability report does is it calls out risks and that's what it's doing is calling out a risk of that and the war in Ukraine the same war in Ukraine you know did have immediately very significant macroeconomic implications because of the connection to Commodities um so thank you thank you thanks very much
