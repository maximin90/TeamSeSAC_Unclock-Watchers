"Transcript of Chairman Powell's Press Conference January 30, 2019 CHAIRMAN POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I will start with a recap of our discussions, including our assessment of the outlook for the economy and the judgments we made about our interest rate policy and our balance sheet. I will cover the decisions we made today as well as our ongoing discussions of matters on which we expect to make decisions in coming meetings. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there. The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains. Inflation remains near our 2 percent goal. We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018. We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate at this time. Despite this positive outlook, over the past few months we have seen some crosscurrents and conflicting signals about the outlook. Growth has slowed in some major foreign economies, particularly in China and Europe. There is elevated uncertainty around several unresolved government policy issues, including Brexit, ongoing trade negotiations, and the effects from the partial government shutdown in the United States. Financial conditions tightened considerably late in 2018 and remain less supportive of growth than they were earlier in 2018. And, while most of the incoming domestic economic data have been solid, some surveys of business and consumer sentiment have moved lower, giving reason for caution. We always emphasize that our policies are data dependent. In other words, as economic conditions and the outlook evolve, we take that new information into account in setting our policies. We are now facing a somewhat contradictory picture of generally strong U.S. macroeconomic performance alongside growing evidence of crosscurrents. At such times, common-sense risk management suggests patiently awaiting greater clarity-an approach that has served policymakers well in the past. With that in mind, I'd like to spell out how the Federal Open Market Committee has been thinking about these issues. At our December meeting, we noted the solid outlook for steady growth, vigorous job creation, and price stability. We also stressed that the extent and timing of any rate increases were uncertain and would depend on incoming data and the evolving outlook. We therefore said that we would be paying close attention to global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the economic outlook. Today the FOMC decided that the cumulative effects of those developments over the last several months warrant a patient, wait-and-see approach regarding future policy changes. In particular, our statement today says, ""In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate."" This change was not driven by a major shift in the baseline outlook for the economy. Like many forecasters, we still see ""sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near . . . 2 percent"" as the likeliest case. But the crosscurrents I mentioned suggest the risk of a less favorable outlook. In addition, the case for raising rates has weakened somewhat. The traditional case for rate increases is to protect the economy from risks that arise when rates are too low for too long, particularly the risk of too-high inflation. Over the past few months, that risk appears to have diminished. Inflation readings have been muted, and the recent drop in oil prices is likely to push headline inflation lower still in coming months. Further, as we noted in our postmeeting statement, while survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been stable, financial market measures of inflation compensation have moved lower. Similarly, the balance-the risk of financial imbalances appears to have receded, as a number of indicators that showed elevated levels of financial risk appetite last fall have moved closer to historical norms. In this environment, we believe we can best support the economy by being patient in evaluating the outlook before making any future adjustment to policy. Let me now turn to balance sheet normalization. Over its past three meetings, the FOMC has held in-depth discussions on the final stages of this process. Today we made some important progress in clarifying the path forward, as summarized in the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization that we released with today's FOMC statement. The Committee made the fundamental decision today to continue indefinitely using our current operating procedure for implementing monetary policy. That is, we will continue to use our administered rates to control the policy rate with an ample supply of reserves so that active management of reserves is not required. This is often called a ""floor system"" or an ""abundant reserves system."" Under the current set of operating procedures, as outlined in the implementation note released today, this means that the federal funds rate, our active policy tool, is held within its target range by appropriately setting the Federal Reserve's administered rates of interest on reserves, as well as the offer rate on the overnight reverse repo facility, without managing the supply of reserves actively. As the minutes of our recent discussions have indicated, the FOMC strongly believes that this approach provides good control of short-term money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effective transmission of those rates to broader financial conditions. Settling this central question clears the way for the FOMC to address a number of further questions regarding the remaining stages of balance sheet normalization. The decision to retain our current operating procedure means that, after allowing for currency in circulation, the ultimate size of our balance sheet will be driven principally by financial institutions' demand for reserves, plus a buffer so that fluctuations in reserve demand do not require us to make frequent sizable market interventions. Estimates of the level of reserve demand are quite uncertain, but we know that this demand in the post-crisis environment is far larger than before. Higher reserve holdings are an important part of the stronger liquidity position that financial institutions must now hold. Moreover, based on surveys and market intelligence, current estimates of reserve demand are considerably higher than estimates of a year or so ago. The implication is that the normalization of the size of the portfolio will be completed sooner, and with a larger balance sheet, than in previous estimates. In light of these estimates and the substantial progress we have made in reducing reserves, the Committee is now evaluating the appropriate timing for the end of balance sheet runoff. This decision will likely be part of a plan for gradually reaching our ultimate balance sheet goals while minimizing risks to achieving our dual-mandate objectives and avoiding unnecessary market disruption. We will be finalizing these plans at coming meetings. The process of balance sheet normalization is unprecedented. Throughout this process we've attempted to lay out our plans well in advance, and we've been willing to make changes as we learn more about the process. The implementation and normalization statement released today is intended to provide some additional clarity regarding the conditions under which we might adjust our plans. The statement makes three points: First, as we've long emphasized, the federal funds rate is our active monetary policy tool. Second, as far as the particular details of normalization are concerned, we will not hesitate to make changes in light of economic and financial developments. This does not mean that we would use the balance sheet as an active tool, but occasional changes could be warranted. Third, we repeat a sentence of the normalization principles we adopted in June of 2017. While the federal funds rate would remain our active tool of policy in a wide range of scenarios, we recognize that the economy could again present conditions in which federal funds rate policy is not sufficient. In those cases, the FOMC would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including balance sheet policy. Times of economic uncertainty put a premium on the clarity and predictability of FOMC policy. We are committed to clearly explaining what we are doing and why we're doing it, both regarding the path of rates and also regarding management of the balance sheet. We believe that this transparency is how we can best contribute to macroeconomic stability. Thank you. I'll be glad to take your questions. "

"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference March 20, 2019 CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. I will begin with an overview of economic conditions and an explanation of the decisions the Committee made at today's meeting. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there. The jobs market is strong, showing healthier wage gains and prompting many people to join or remain in the workforce. The unemployment rate is near historic lows, and inflation remains near our 2 percent goal. We continue to expect that the American economy will grow at a solid pace in 2019, although likely slower than the very strong pace of 2018. We believe that our current policy stance is appropriate. Since last year, however, we have noted some developments at home and around the world that bear close attention. Given the overall favorable conditions in our economy, my colleagues and I will be patient in assessing what, if any, changes in the stance of policy may be needed. Let me explain in more detail how incoming data warrant our current stance and a wait and see approach to changes. With the benefit of fiscal stimulus and other tailwinds, growth in 2018 was strong-in fact, at 3.1 percent, the strongest year in more than a decade. For some time, most forecasts have called for growth to continue in 2019 at a somewhat lower but still healthy pace. For example, last September, Committee participants saw growth coming in at about 2.5 percent this year. Data arriving since September suggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected. Financial conditions tightened considerably over the fourth quarter. While conditions have eased since then, they remain less supportive of growth than during most of 2018. Growth has slowed in some foreign economies-notably, in Europe and China. While the U.S. economy showed little evidence of slowdown through the end of 2018, the limited data we have so far this year have been somewhat more mixed. Unusually strong payroll job growth in January was followed by little growth at all in February. Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year's strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants. Many other labor market indicators continue to show strength. Weak retail sales data for December bounced back considerably in January but, on balance, seem to point to somewhat slower growth in consumer spending. Business fixed investment also appears to be growing at a slower pace than last year. Inflation has been muted, and some indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain at the low end of their ranges in recent years. Along with these developments, unresolved policy issues, such as Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations, pose some risks to the outlook. Much of the discussion at our meeting focused on what we should make of the varied indicators. Today's Summary of Economic Projections, the SEP, reflects the assessments of individual Committee participants. And these views are in line with a broad range of other forecasts and point to a modest slowdown, with overall conditions remaining favorable. FOMC participants sought-now see 2019 growth at roughly 2 percent, with the unemployment rate remaining below 4 percent. Core inflation, which omits the effects of volatile food and energy prices, remains close to 2 percent. Declines in oil prices since last fall are expected to push headline inflation below 2 percent for a time, but this effect is likely to be temporary. Now, I'm describing views of the most likely outcomes, but historical experience reminds us that growth and inflation this year could be stronger or weaker than what we now project. The federal funds rate is now in the broad range of estimates of neutral-the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy. As I noted, my colleagues and I think that this setting is well suited to the current outlook and believe that we should be patient in assessing the need for any change in the stance of policy. ""Patient"" means that we see no need to rush to judgment. It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy. In discussing the Committee's projections, it's useful to note what those projections are, as well as what they are not. The SEP includes participants' individual projections of the most likely economic scenario, along with their views of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in that scenario. Views about the most likely scenario form one input into our policy discussions. We also discuss other plausible scenarios, including the risk of more worrisome outcomes. These and other scenarios and many other considerations go into policy but are not reflected in projections of the most likely case. Thus, we always emphasize that the interest rate projections in the SEP are not a Committee decision. They are not a Committee plan. As Chair Yellen noted some years ago, the FOMC statement, rather than the dot plot, is the device that the Committee uses to express its opinions about the likely path of rates. Today the Committee released Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans-revised Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans. We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively. We have sought to make the normalization process transparent, predictable, and gradual in order to minimize disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives. Today's announcement is the result of discussions over the past four FOMC meetings about how best to achieve these goals. The plans have many technical details, and I'll be happy to answer questions on those details. But, for now, I'll summarize the key elements. Since October 2017, we have been allowing our asset holdings to decline by not reinvesting all of the payments we receive as securities matured or were prepaid. Today we announced that we intend to slow the runoff of our assets starting in May and to cease runoff entirely in September of this year. In September, reserve balances may still be somewhat above the level required to conduct policy efficiently and effectively. If this is so, we may hold the size of our asset holdings roughly constant for a time. During this time, ongoing gradual increases in currency and our other nonreserve liabilities would imply very gradual declines in reserve balances. When the Committee judges that reserves should not decline further, securities holdings will again begin to rise, as dictated by the growth of demand for our reserve and nonreserve liabilities. We believe that these plans will facilitate a predictable, transparent, and smooth process, and we will make additional adjustments if conditions warrant. The Committee will soon turn to a few remaining normalization topics, including the desired maturity composition of our portfolio of Treasury securities. We maintain our long-stated intention to return to a portfolio consisting mainly of Treasury securities. Thank you. And I will be glad to take your questions. "

"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference May 1, 2019 CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the American people. Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with our expectations. Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker. Overall, the economy continues on a healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate. The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment. Job gains rebounded in March after a weak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force. Although first-quarter GDP rose more than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed investment slowed. Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year. The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. For much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside considerable slack in resource utilization. But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 4 percent, inflation moved up. From March through December, core inflation-which excludes volatile food and energy components-was at or very close to 2 percent. Overall inflation fluctuated from a few tenths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the moves mostly due to changes in energy prices. As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system. Overall inflation for the 12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent. Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months. We suspect that some transitory factors may be at work. Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric around our longer-term objective. At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations. While concerns remain in all of these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat. Global financial conditions have eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy and, in some cases, fiscal policy. Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now. Further, there are reports of progress in the trade talks between the United States and China. The Committee views these developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in monetary policy. Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about our balance sheet. In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves. In March, we decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff, starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely in September. These plans support our longer-run dual-mandate objectives and also provide clarity about the path of our asset holdings. Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the portfolio. Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter-term debt of the federal government. In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery. Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer-term securities. As part of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term. This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy. Today's preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the year. There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for smooth adjustment. As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds. Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing monetary policy: the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate. The change does not reflect any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy. We use the IOER rate to help keep the federal funds rate in our target range. As balance sheet normalization continues, we have expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate. Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range. These actions helped keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range. And today we made one more such change. The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, and it remains unchanged. Thank you very much. I will be glad to take your questions. "

"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference June 19, 2019 CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to sustain the economic expansion, with a strong job market and stable prices, for the benefit of the American people. At the FOMC meeting that concluded today, we maintained our policy interest rate but made some significant changes to our statement. Since the beginning of the year, we have judged that our current policy stance was broadly appropriate and that we should be patient in assessing the need for any changes. In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective. I'd like to step back and review how the changing economic and financial picture brings us to today's decision. So far this year, the economy has performed reasonably well, with solid fundamentals supporting continued growth and strong employment. Inflation has been running somewhat below our objective, but we have expected it to pick up, supported by solid growth and a strong job market. Along with this favorable picture, we have been mindful of some ongoing crosscurrents, including trade developments and concerns about global growth. At the time of our last FOMC meeting, which ended on May 1, there was tentative evidence that these crosscurrents were moderating. The latest data from China and Europe were encouraging, and there were reports of progress in trade negotiations with China. Our continued patient stance seemed appropriate, and the Committee saw no strong case for adjusting our policy rate. In the weeks since our last meeting, the crosscurrents have reemerged. Growth indicators from around the world have disappointed, on net, raising concerns about the strength of the global economy. Apparent progress on trade turned to greater uncertainty, and our contacts in business and agriculture report heightened concerns over trade developments. These concerns may have contributed to the drop in business confidence in some recent surveys and may be starting to show through to incoming data. Risk sentiment in financial markets has deteriorated as well. Against this backdrop, inflation remains muted. While the baseline outlook remains favorable, the question is whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook and thus call for additional monetary policy accommodation. Many FOMC participants now see that the case for a somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened. Let me explain the basis for this judgment, starting with the outlook for jobs and growth. Participants see unemployment remaining low this year and next. Monthly job gains in May were lower than expected, however, and, in light of recent developments, this bears watching. Still, many labor market indicators remain strong. Community, business, and labor leaders all tell us that the prospects for job seekers have seldom been better, and that this is true even for those who have traditionally struggled to find work. Wages are rising, and this is particularly so for lower-paying jobs. Committee participants' growth projections from 2019 are little revised from March, with a central tendency of 2 percent to 2.2 percent, just above their estimates of longer-run normal growth. The growth projections for the year as a whole mask some important details about the composition of growth. Annual growth will be boosted by the surprisingly strong first quarter, which had just been reported at the time of the May FOMC meeting. As I noted then, the unexpected strength was largely in net exports and inventories-components that are not generally reliable indicators of ongoing momentum. The more reliable drivers of growth in the economy are spending on consumption and business investment. While consumption was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace. In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter.economy are spending on consumption and business investment. While consumption was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace.

While consumption was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace. In contrast, the limited evidence available at this time suggests that growth in business fixed income has slowed in the second quarter. 1 Chair Powell intended to say that growth in business fixed investment slowed in the second quarter. After running close to our symmetric 2 percent objective for most of last year, inflation declined in the first quarter. Data since then show some pickup. Participants broadly see inflation moving back up toward our 2 percent objective, but at a slower pace than had been expected. The central tendency for 2019 core inflation, which omits volatile food and energy components, is between 1.7 and 1.8 percent. Setting aside short-term fluctuations, Committee participants expressed concerns about the pace of inflation's return to 2 percent. Wages are rising, as noted above, but not at a pace that would provide much upward impetus to inflation. Moreover, weaker global growth may continue to hold inflation down around the world. We are firmly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we are well aware that inflation weakness that persists even in a healthy economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in longer-run inflation expectations. Because there are no definitive measures of inflation expectations, we must rely on imperfect proxies. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved down since our May meeting, and some survey-based expectations measures are near the bottom of their historic ranges. Combining these factors with the risks to growth already noted, participants expressed concerns about a more sustained shortfall of inflation. Overall, our policy discussions focused on the appropriate response to the uncertain environment. The projections of appropriate policy show that many participants believe that some cut in the federal funds rate will be appropriate in the scenario that they see as most likely. Though some participants wrote down policy cuts and others did not, our deliberations made clear that a number of those who wrote down a flat rate path agree that the case for additional accommodation has strengthened since our May meeting. This added accommodation would support economic activity and inflation's return to our objective. Uncertainties surrounding the baseline outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting. It is important, however, that monetary policy not overreact to any individual data point or short-term swing in sentiment. Doing so would risk adding even more uncertainty to the outlook. Thus, my colleagues and I will be looking to see whether these uncertainties will continue to weigh on the outlook, and we will use our tools as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Thank you. I will be pleased to take your questions. "

"JEANNA SMIALEK. Hi, Chair Powell. Jeanna Smialek with the New York Times. Per your statement here, I guess the question is, is there any reason to believe that a 25 basis point cut is going to be sufficient to expediently return inflation to your 2 percent target? And, if not, what are you going to be looking at to convince you that you need to cut rates again? What is the hurdle rate there? CHAIR POWELL. So I think you have to look at not just the 25 basis point cut, but look at the Committee's actions over the course of the year. As I noted in my opening statement, we started off expecting some rate increases, we moved to a patient setting for a few months, and now we've moved here. I think what you've seen over the course of the year is, as we've moved to a more accommodative policy, the economy has actually performed just about as expected with that gradually increasing support. And I think-I wouldn't take credit for all of that, but I do think that increasing policy support has kept the economy on track and kept the outlook favorable. In terms of the rest of your question, the Committee is really thinking of this as a way of adjusting policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance to further the three objectives that I mentioned: to insure against downside risks, to provide support to the economy, that those factors are-where factors are pushing down on economic growth, and then to support inflation. So we do think it will serve all of those goals, but again, we're thinking of it as essentially in the nature of a midcycle adjustment to policy. MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg Television and Radio. There's a perception out there that perhaps, in this case, the Fed is something of a hammer in search of a nail, because the latest consumer spending reports, as you suggested, don't seem to show any kind of demand problem in the U.S. And when you look at mortgage rates, auto lending rates, they've all come down. And so, wondering exactly what problem lower capital costs will solve. CHAIR POWELL. So, you're absolutely right. The-the performance of the economy has been reasonably good. The position of the economy is as close to our objectives as it's been in a long time, and the outlook is also good. What we've been monitoring since the beginning of the year is, effectively, downside risks to that outlook from weakening global growth, and we see that everywhere: weak manufacturing, weak global growth now, particularly in the European Union and China. In addition, we see trade policy developments, which at times have been disruptive and then have been less so, and also inflation running below target. So we see those as threats to what is clearly a favorable outlook, and we see this action as designed to support them and keep that outlook favorable. And, frankly, it is a continuation of what we've been doing all year to provide more support against those very same risks. MICHAEL MCKEE. But the follow-up question is, how does it do that? How does cutting interest rates lower-or, how does cutting interest rates keep that going, since the cost of capital doesn't seem to be the issue here? CHAIR POWELL. You know, I-I really think it does, and I think the evidence of my eyes tells me that our policy does support-it supports confidence, it supports economic activity, household and business confidence, and through channels that we understand. So it will lower borrowing costs. It will-and it will work. And I think you see it. Since-you know, since we noted our vigilance about the situation in June, you saw financial conditions move up, and you saw-I won't take credit for the whole recovery, but you saw financial conditions move up. You see confidence, which had troughed in June-you saw it move back up. You see economic activity on a healthy basis. It just-it seems to work through confidence channels as well as the mechanical channels that you are talking about. HEATHER LONG. Hi, Heather Long from the Washington Post. You always say that the Fed is data dependent, and much of the data that we've seen since the June meeting has surprised to the upside or at least been in line with expectations. Can you give us a sense of how that better-than-expected data impacted the FOMC's thinking? And if we keep seeing these upside surprises, does that change or evolve any FOMC thinking going forward? CHAIR POWELL. So, yes. I mean, I think we-of course, you know, what we do at every meeting, as I noted, is, we do a deep dive into U.S. economic activity and global activity and, certainly, carefully went through U.S. economic activity, which there has been some positive and some negative, but, overall, the U.S. economy has shown resilience during the intermeeting period. But, again, the-the issue is more the downside risks and then the shortfall in inflation, and we're trying to address those. So, in addition, going forward, I would say, we're going to be monitoring those same things. We'll be monitoring the evolution of trade uncertainty, of global growth, and of low inflation. And we'll also, of course, be watching the performance of the U.S. economy. As I mentioned, it had shown some resilience here to those issues, and we'll be putting all of that together, and that's how we'll be thinking about policy going forward. STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. I just want to follow up on that. Would you say we're sort of-you guys have gotten into a new regime here? This is sort of an insurance cut and not a data-dependent cut? And are we now more in the realm of watching headlines of trade talks than we are watching unemployment rate and inflation numbers, or-and growth numbers? What-how do we know what you're going to do next, and why now in this new regime? CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So I gave three reasons for what we did, and that is to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions. So that is-in a sense, that is a risk-management point, and that is a bit of insurance. But we also feel like weak global growth and trade tensions are having an effect on the U.S. economy. You see it now in the second quarter: You see weak investment, you see weak manufacturing-so support demand there and also to support return of inflation to 2 percent. But there's definitely an insurance aspect of it. Trade is unusual. We don't-you know, the thing is, there isn't a lot of experience in responding to global trade tensions. So it is a-it's something that we haven't faced before and that we're learning by doing. And it is not-it's not exactly the same as watching global growth, where you see growth weakening, you see central banks and governments responding with fiscal policy, and you see growth strengthening, and you see a business cycle. With trade tensions-which do seem to be having a significant effect on financial market conditions and on the economy-they evolve in a different way, and we have to follow them. And, by the way, I want to be clear here. We play no role whatsoever in assessing or evaluating trade policies other than as-as trade policy uncertainty has an effect on the U.S. economy in the short and medium term. We're not in any way criticizing trade policy. That's really not our job. NICK TIMIRAOS. Thank you. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. So, Chair Powell, you and your colleagues have offered three reasons to cut rates: a lower neutral rate that may have made policy a little bit tighter than anticipated, the global slowdown and the darker risk picture from the trade tensions, and this desire to re-center inflation and inflation expectations. I wonder, which of those factors, if any, weighs most heavily on you? And, more importantly, is a ¼ point cut really going to address all of that, let alone any one of those? CHAIR POWELL. So I actually think different people have different-different weightings has been my experience on those things. You mentioned lower r*, trade slowdown-and I would actually add, lower natural rate of unemployment too has moved down, all of which kind of point to more accommodation. So, again, I don't think asking about a ¼ point is really the right question. I think you have to look back over the course of the year and see the Committee moving away from rate increases to a neutral posture to, now, a rate cut. So I think we've been providing-and that affects the forward rate path, and it affects financial conditions, and financial conditions affect the economy. You see an economy which is actually performing pretty well. Growth in the first half of this year is about the same as it was in all of '18 and actually a little better than our forecast for growth in 2019-at the end of 2019. So I think, in a way, that's monetary policy working. And, again, I wouldn't just look at the 25 basis point cut as the right question. NICK TIMIRAOS. If I could follow up, I guess in May-in May it seemed as if you were setting a higher bar to cut rates: There would need to be a deterioration in the outlook. In June, you seemed to suggest that if the outlook didn't improve, there might be a rate cut. Where is that bar right now, because I think there's some confusion about how the Committee is responding. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So we, as we noted-we noted at the bottom of the statement that language, which really says how we're thinking about it. So it says, as we're contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, we'll continue to monitor the implications of incoming information-and it talks about that language. So, you know, I can't-all I can tell you is, we'll be looking at weak global growth. We'll be looking very carefully to see how that's happening. And I think you see-you learn-every cycle you learn about these things. So we will see whether growth is picking up, whether it's bottoming out. We'll see that picture. We'll also see on trade. You know, we're going to be seeing-I think we've learned a lot on trade in this cycle. I think we'll continue to learn more, and on inflation we will. So, in addition, the U.S. economy itself is-the performance of the U.S. economy will enter into that. So I would love to be more precise, but with trade, it is a factor that we have to assess in kind of a new way. Those are the things that we'll be looking at, and-you know, in making our decisions going forward. EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence with Fox Business Network. So a rate hike last December was seen by some economists and the St. Louis Fed president, James Bullard, as a step too far. Now the Fed's waited about seven months for a rate cut. You said today you were concerned about downside risks. So could some of the weakness on the business side, with that fixed investment and the sluggish side on the business side, be because the Fed waited so long? I want to get your thoughts on that and talk about why you feel that this nudge is the right level. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So we don't hear that from businesses. They don't come in and say, ""We're not investing because, you know, the federal funds rate is too high."" I haven't heard that from a business. What you hear is that demand is weak for their products. You see manufacturing being weak all over the world. Investment-business investment is weak. And I wouldn't lay all of that at the door of trade talks. I think there's a-there's a global business cycle happening with manufacturing and investment, and that's-that's been, you know, definitely a bigger factor than, certainly, we expected late last year. I think global-global growth started to slow down in the middle of last year, but that has gone on to a greater extent. And, by the way, trade policy uncertainty has also been, I think, more elevated than we anticipated. In terms of, is this the-we believe this is the right move for today, and we think it's-we think it will serve the three ends that I mentioned. And I've already gone over how we're thinking about going forward. ANN SAPHIR. Ann Saphir with Reuters. You called it ""a midcycle adjustment to policy."" And, I mean, what should we take this to mean, and what message do you mean to send with this move today about future rate moves? CHAIR POWELL. Well, the sense of that is-I mean, that refers back to other times when the FOMC has cut rates in the middle of a cycle. And I'm contrasting it there with the beginning-for example, the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle. ANN SAPHIR. So we're not at the beginning of a lengthy cutting cycle? CHAIR POWELL. That is not-that's not what we're seeing now. That's not our perspective now or outlook. JAMES POLITI. Hi there. Are there any circumstances under which you would decide to pause-pause at one interest rate cut, today's interest rate cut, and not-not, not go ahead with further monetary easing at this stage? Or are you predicting that, you know, once you've embarked on this easing, you will have to at least move by one more notch going forward? CHAIR POWELL. You know, so our policy is-will depend on the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook as well as evolving risks to that outlook. And so we're going to be monitoring the implications of incoming information for the outlook, as I mentioned. And, so I-that's really where I would leave you with that. VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi. Victoria Guida with Politico. On capital, Vice Chairman Quarles has said that the level of capital requirements that exists right now are such that it's basically like the countercyclical capital buffer is already turned on, and that he would like the ability to be able to turn it down in a downturn. I was wondering if you agreed with that. And then, also, just quickly, on real-time payments-larger banks have suggested that if the Fed built its own system, that would be a bait-and-switch, because the Fed asked-or called for a private-sector system. Do you think that that is a fair assessment? CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So, on the first, I would say that I view the level of capital requirements and the level of capital in the system as being about right. I do agree with that. The idea that you're talking about is one that's-that Vice Chair Quarles has talked about. It's a-it's one under consideration. The idea being, in a sense, we've chosen, in the United States, to have high through-the-cycle capital requirements by doubling the SIFI surcharge, which is the surcharge that the largest banks have in their capital requirements. We've, in effect, already put in place substantial countercyclical buffers. And so, conceptually, you can think of-I'm not saying it's the same thing as a countercyclical capital buffer. So that's-that's really the point-is that we don't rely-our system doesn't rely on our ability-it doesn't mainly rely on our ability to identify the right time in the cycle to trigger a countercyclical tool. We rely on through-the-cycle, always-on high capital and liquidity requirements. And I think that's a good thing to do. The idea of putting it in place so you can cut it, that's something some other jurisdictions have done, and it's worth considering. I think the United Kingdom, in particular, has a countercyclical capital buffer that's always on, but the one point of it is that you can cut when there's a downturn and therefore give the banks more room. So this isn't something we've decided to do. It's just under consideration. In terms of the real-time payment system, your second question, so this is something we-the United States is far behind other countries in terms of having real-time payments available to the general public. The Fed, really, coming out of the Reserve System-the Reserve Banks and the Board together-convened all of the stakeholders around the table to talk about how we can move forward. This is consumer groups, technology companies, banks, card companies-pretty much all of the groups who would be interested-and worked on a project for several years. And one of the things that came out of that was a recommendation that the Fed should build a 24 x 7 x 365 real-time settlement system to solve that problem-to address that problem. We put out a proposal in October of last year about, you know, should we do this, and we got quite a lot of comments. They were overwhelmingly favorable. And I would point out that in our payment system, in many places, the Fed operates alongside private-sector operators-for example, in wholesale payments, in ACH, and in check-so it wouldn't be unusual or out of keeping with-with how we've done things in the past. We have not made a decision on this, but it's something we're looking at carefully and something I do expect we'll make a decision on soon. CRAIG TORRES. Craig Torres from Bloomberg. I'm trying to parse what you're saying here. On the one hand, you say the policy tilt in the statement has eased financial conditions, and that's helping the economy. In that tilt, market participants are interpreting this language, ""will act as appropriate,"" as still being in the statement. And, on the other hand, you say it's not the start of a-of an easing cycle. So what are you saying? Does that mean, you know, with one or two more cuts you'll be done, and this policy bias comes out of the statement? Or simply that this policy bias will come out of the statement sooner than market participants think? CHAIR POWELL. So it is-as I mentioned, it's going to depend on the evolving data and the evolving risk picture. But as we look at the situation now and the outlook now, what we see is that it's appropriate to make an adjustment in policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance. That's what we're seeing. And that's what we're going to be looking-you know, we'll be looking at incoming data, at all of the-at the risks that I mentioned, and the performance of the U.S. economy, and at low inflation. We'll be looking at that to make our decisions going forward. SCOTT HORSLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Scott Horsley for NPR. You've talked a number of times about the people who feel like they are just recently getting to the punchbowl 10 years into this expansion. Can you elaborate a little bit on how this rate cut is expected to help them? CHAIR POWELL. Well, I think the best thing for people who are-who are feeling that-and we are getting lots of feedback from people who work and live in low- and moderate-income communities to the effect that they're now feeling the recovery, and, in fact, they haven't felt a better labor market in anybody's memory, so this is great to hear. And I guess my view is, the best thing we can do for those people is to sustain the expansion, keep it going, and that's one of the overarching goals of-of this move and all of our policy moves. There really is no reason why the expansion can't keep going. Inflation is not troublingly high. If you look at the-at the U.S. economy right now, there's no sector that's booming and therefore might bust. You have a fairly well-balanced, in a sense, economy. Now, the engine, though, is really a consumer economy, which is 70 percent of the economy. The manufacturing economy-the investment and manufacturing part of the economy-is more or less not-not growing much. It's at a healthy level but not growing much. So-and we hope to help that with this rate cut. But, I would say, overall, we're trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices. DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. The President has repeatedly called for this rate hike and for the Fed to end the runoff of its balance sheet. What do you say to those that say that the Fed gave into what the President wanted today? And could you also elaborate a little bit further on why the Fed decided to speed up its balance sheet runoff two months earlier today? CHAIR POWELL. So I gave my-my reasons for-our reasons, really-for doing this. And, you know, just to touch on that again, this action is designed to insure against downside risks to the outlook from weak global growth and trade tensions, offset the negative effect that those factors are already having, and promote a faster return of inflation to 2 percent. That's what we've been talking about all year long, and we've gradually moved our policy in the direction of more accommodation. I think what you see is an economy that has reacted well to that. So that's what we're doing, and that's why we're doing it. We never take into account political considerations. There's no place in our discussions for that. We also don't conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence. We conduct monetary policy in order to-to move as close as possible to our statutory goals, and that's what we're always going to do. We're always going to use our tools that way. And then, at the end, we'll-you know, we'll live with the results. In terms of the balance sheet, that was really just a matter of simplicity and consistency. Really nothing more to it than that. GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chairman Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. I was wondering-we weren't in the room, but I think it's a fair assumption to know that the two dissenters probably spoke about financial stability concerns. So I was wondering if you could talk about what you-what was your response to them when those concerns were raised? I've collected a couple of things from the IMF, and the Bank of International Settlements said that it's just-when you have low rates, you just get more debt in the economy, and that there's also this feeling that it makes it harder to raise rates. So could you talk about that? Thank you. CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So, first, let me say-I'll just speak for myself, but I understand those concerns very well. I do. I've-you know, I've studied them, I've spoken about them, and I take them very seriously. But as I look at today's situation, I don't see them as a reason not to take this action today. I just don't think-that would be my point. And one of the reasons why I think that is, if you look-if you look-so we have a financial stability framework now for the first time. Before the crisis, we didn't have this, but now we have it, and we publish it. And we look at, really, four big things so that we know we can-you know, the public can hold us accountable and compare us meeting to meeting, and-you know, and see whether we got this right, because it's transparent now. But the four things we look at are valuation pressures. And we do see notable valuation pressures in some markets but, you know, honestly, not at a highly troubling level. In terms of household borrowing, household and business borrowing is the second thing. Households are in a very good shape overall. I'll come back to business borrowing. Leverage in the financial system is low, and funding risk is low. So, overall, staff's view has been-and my view has been-that if you look overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate. The place that gets all the attention right now-a lot of attention-is business borrowing, and we look very carefully at that. What's happening with business borrowing is, the loans have moved off the balance sheets of the banks and into market-based vehicles, which tend to be stably funded. But, nonetheless, it's clear that the highly leveraged business sector could act as an amplifier to a downturn. So we're watching that very carefully. But, again, I think if you look overall at the U.S. financial system, what you see is a high level of resilience-much higher than it was before the crisis-and that's something to take comfort from. And I think all of that gives us the ability to use monetary policy for its purposes and rely on supervisory and regulatory tools to-you know, to keep the financial system resilient. GREG ROBB. So you're not doing something today for-to help today, and then it's going to cause problems down the road? You're not worried about that kind of dynamic? CHAIR POWELL. There are very few things that I don't worry about at all. So, of course, of course, we monitor. We have-every quarter we have an extensive briefing on financial stability, and we had that yesterday. So we look at this on an ongoing basis. We have a great team. We liaise with central banks around the world. You know, one of my colleagues is the head of the Financial Stability Board globally, so we're very, very much monitoring these things all the time. And we worry about them all the time. We're always looking at the-we're looking for that thing that we may have missed a lot of the time. But the things we haven't missed, I think they paint a mixed picture, but not one that should prevent us from taking monetary policy actions that we think are appropriate to support the economy. MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Marty Crutsinger, AP. You've talked in this press conference about being data dependent going forward, and that this is not the start of a series of rate cuts. But the financial markets seem to think that this is the start of a series of rate cuts, and they're predicting three, four cuts this year. Is this your effort to try to damp down that-that thing? CHAIR POWELL. No. Let me be clear. What I said was, it's not-it's not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts. I didn't-I didn't say it's just one or anything like that. What I said is, when you think about rate-cutting cycles, they go on for a long time, and the Committee is not seeing that-not seeing us in that place. You would do that if you saw real economic weakness and you thought that the federal funds rate needed to be cut a lot. That's not what we're seeing. That's not what we're seeing. What we're seeing is that it's appropriate to-to adjust policy to a somewhat more accommodative stance over time, and that's how we're looking at it. What I said was, it's not a long cutting cycle-in other words, referring to what we do when there's a recession or a very severe downturn. That's-that's really what I was ruling out. I think, if you look back at other midcycle adjustments, you'll see-you know, I don't know that they'll be, in the end, comparable or not, but you'll see examples of these. DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. You mentioned the difficulty of assessing trade tensions in the economic outlook. Could you say how much of a factor the U.S.-China trade conflict was in the Fed's decision to cut rates? And if the current stalemate and the threat of more tariffs continue, what would that mean for future interest rates and possible cuts? CHAIR POWELL. So, you know, I wouldn't bring it down to any one trade thing or any one factor. I think we look at a broad range of factors, and trade uncertainty-trade policy uncertainty is one of them. That certainly includes the discussions with China, but I wouldn't-I wouldn't be able to tell you how much of it is due to that. And without knowing-you know, I think we-with trade, we have to react to the developments, and we don't know what they'll be, and so it's hard to exactly say. Certainly, we've seen, though, that when there's a sharp confrontation between two large economies, you can see effects on business confidence pretty quickly and on financial markets pretty quickly. We saw that in June. But then we saw them unwind after that, to some extent. You've seen it returning to-to a much lower temperature, I think. Again, with-with trade policy, we're just going to be watching and trying to assess the implications for the-for the U.S. outlook. DON LEE. How much of an effect could the tariffs have? CHAIR POWELL. You know, the mechanical effects of the tariffs are quite small. They're not large as it relates to the U.S. economy. The real question is, what are the effects on the economy through the-through the confidence channel-business confidence channel? And, again, very, very hard to tease that out. I've seen some research, which-you know, which says that they are meaningful-meaningful effects on-on output. That's to say, not trivial. And I think that that sounds right, but it's quite hard to get-there is no way to get an accurate measure. You have to look at a range of estimates, and I think businesses will tell you that it's a factor, particularly businesses that have-manufacturing businesses that have supply chains that cross international borders will all tell you that it's been a challenge. Many of them have made adjustments, and they've gotten to a place where it's okay, but it's-it's been a challenge. PAUL KIERNAN. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thanks for the question, Chairman. As the press conference-as this press conference has gone under way, markets have declined. The Dow is down as much as 400 points. What I'm hearing is a reluctance to provide more guidance around the future path of rates. And I'm wondering if that reflects a greater lack of consensus on the Committee. And, you know, how much consensus do you want to see around these decisions, and how split are people about this? CHAIR POWELL. You know, you're right. There's a range of views on the Committee, and-but the Committee is unified, completely unified on our dedication to making the best policy decisions that we can make. And that means people have a responsibility to do their best thinking and to present that thinking, and I wouldn't have it any other way. In terms of the way forward, we will be monitoring the factors that I mentioned, and we laid that out in the-you know, in the postmeeting statement, and that's the roadmap we're going to be following going forward. We're going to be data dependent. We're going to be, as we always are, doing what we need to do-what we believe we need to do to support the economic expansion. JOHN HELTMAN. Hi, John Heltman with American Banker. So it's been about 18 months since the Fed issued its enforcement action against Wells Fargo. And I was wondering if you could characterize the progress that the bank has made towards the shortcomings that it had in its risk-management processes. And I'm also curious whether their lack of a permanent CEO has hampered progress, in your eyes. CHAIR POWELL. So the problems at Wells Fargo-that arose at Wells Fargo around risk management and consumer-the way they dealt with the consumer were actually pretty deep, and I think the company realizes that. And they're not going to be fixed-they haven't been fixed quickly, and, frankly, we didn't expect them to be fixed quickly. So they're-you know, they-they will be under the growth cap, our enforcement action, until the Board votes to lift it, and that's not something we're considering doing right now. And the Committee-I mean, the company is working away to address these issues, but, as I said, they're deep-seated issues, and it just takes time to address them. I wouldn't comment on the CEO question. I don't really have anything for you on that. JOHN HELTMAN. I mean, I just-I'd like to clarify, like, are you pleased with the responsiveness you're getting from them? Do you feel like this is going the way that you kind of wanted it to go? CHAIR POWELL. I'm not going to characterize it. You know-I mean, I have characterized it. We have-we have an enforcement action in place. The company is working away at addressing it. They take it seriously. I think they do see it as we do, as something that has to go deep. And, you know, we'll lift the growth cap when we're satisfied. NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with Marketplace. So when we have our next recession, the Fed will have less room-it will happen-the Fed will have less room to maneuver cutting interest rates since you're cutting now. How big of a problem will that be? CHAIR POWELL. You know, the premise is not-I will question your premise for a second. If you remember whether-again, one of the purposes of our-of our cut today is to support the expansion. And we don't know when-and if it really works-if that works very well and the economy gets going again, you know, you don't know where the-where the funds, in other cycles-and I don't know whether this will happen or not, but in other cycles, the Fed wound up raising rates again after a midcycle adjustment. Again, I'm not predicting that, but I don't think that we know that we won't have-that we'll have less ammo because of these things. That's one thing. So- NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. But you won't be able to cut as much if-if rates are low. I mean, you will have-have less ammo, in that sense. CHAIR POWELL. Well, but you're assuming that we would never raise rates again, that once we've cut these rates that they can never go back up again. Just as a matter of principle, I don't think that's right. In other-in other long, long cycles, long U.S. business cycles have sometimes involved this kind of event where the Fed will stop hiking-in fact, will cut-and then will go back to hiking. Again, I don't know whether that'll happen right here. It doesn't seem-it doesn't seem like something that's in-you know, particularly likely, frankly, but we don't know that. And the other thing is, I think by extending the cycle, you-you do have a lot of benefits from that. And I think, you know, we will use the tools that we have. A couple of rate hikes one way or the other isn't going to matter so much if there is a downturn. And you're right, there will eventually be one. We'll use all of our tools aggressively, as we need to, when that time comes. JEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with MNI. Can you give us an update on the ongoing reassessment of the inflation framework? And have the discussions so far this year had any bearing on today's decision? CHAIR POWELL. So the monetary policy review is really for-it's really there to look at the way we make policy in the longer run. It's not something that enters directly into our discussions today. We've had-so far we've had a series of meetings, called Fed Listens, at almost all the Reserve Banks. Soon it will be all the Reserve Banks. And we meet there with the constituencies that we serve, and they've been very, very successful, hearing from people-not just-not just economists, but people who are not economists, how-how their lives interact with the Fed's work. It's been-it's been great. I've got to say, it's been even better than I hoped it would be. We're just now beginning the process of incorporating all of that feedback, and we're going to be having a series of meetings, beginning today and yesterday, as we evaluate, you know, the questions that we're asking about our framework. So it's very early to say where that's going, but, you know, we're setting the table now and looking at what our framework is and looking at how it's performed, looking at how all frameworks performed around the world during the Global Financial Crisis. I expect we'll be at this a while. I'm very excited about it. I think it's been a good exercise. I think it's opened us up to sunlight and perspectives that we might not have gotten otherwise. And I think it's a good time. You know, you have-10 years after the crisis, you're really living in a new normal for the economy and monetary policy, and it's a really good time to step back and ask whether there are some things that we can do to improve our framework. COURTENAY BROWN. Hi, Mr. Chairman. Courtenay Brown from Axios. Can you give us a sense of whether the Committee feels constrained at all by the market's expectations for more cuts or other developments in financial markets? CHAIR POWELL. So I think this was-this was well telegraphed. What we did today was-was very consistent with what we had said we were going to do. I had mentioned the reasons for it. They've been well telegraphed, and I think-you know, I think they will-they will achieve their goals. We do know that monetary policy works through communications and then actions that are consistent with those communications, and we think that the changes that we've made this year have really worked. Of course, we always retain the flexibility to adjust our communications and our actions to-in light of incoming data and the evolving risk picture, but-I'll leave it there. BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi, Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. Just to expand on that point about communication, I mean, we saw that markets have been particularly sensitive with regards to New York Fed President John Williams's remarks before the blackout period. So the Fed added language in the statement that says that the Committee is contemplating the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate as it monitors implications. I'm wondering-now there's kind of this inflection point about whether or not the downside risk, because you've had to cut rates, outweighs the fact that you still see a positive outlook of the U.S. economy at a baseline. So, just wondering if you can kind of clarify all those things within the context of the challenges of communicating it. CHAIR POWELL. Yeah, so again, I see the U.S. outlook as being a positive one. And we do-we have had these global, really, risks to the outlook. There really-there really is nothing in the U.S. economy that presents a-you know, a prominent near-term threat to the U.S. economy. As I mentioned, there's no-there's no segment that's really-or sector that's really boiling over and overheating. Nothing like that. It's-it's within-within the economy. It's-it's healthy, so I would say that. Downside risks are really coming from abroad. And, of course, we are concerned about-about low inflation. But-and, by the way, those risks from abroad are affecting the manufacturing sector here and business investment-fixed investment. So-thank you."

"Transcript of Chair Powell's Press Conference September 18, 2019 CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people. We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and stable prices. We are committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis. Today we decided to lower interest rates. As I will explain shortly, we took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of some notable developments and to provide insurance against ongoing risks. The U.S. economy has continued to perform well. We are into the 11th year of this economic expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable. The economy grew at a 2½ percent pace in the first half of the year. Household spending-supported by a strong job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence-has been the key driver of growth. In contrast, business investment and exports have weakened amid falling manufacturing output. The main reasons appear to be slower growth abroad and trade policy developments-two sources of uncertainty that we've been monitoring all year. Since the middle of last year, the global growth outlook has weakened, notably in Europe and China. Additionally, a number of geopolitical risks, including Brexit, remain unresolved. Trade policy tensions have waxed and waned, and elevated uncertainty is weighing on U.S. investment and exports. Our business contacts around the country have been telling us that uncertainty about trade policy has discouraged them from investing in their businesses. Business fixed investment posted a modest decline in the second quarter, and recent indicators point to continued softness. Even so, with household spending remaining on a solid footing and with supportive financial conditions, we expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate. As seen from FOMC participants' most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth remains near 2 percent this year and next before edging down toward its estimated longer-run value. The job market remains strong. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half, and job gains have remained solid in recent months. The pace of job gains has eased this year, but we had expected some slowing after last year's strong pace. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing. And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives. This underscores, for us, the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. We expect the job market to remain strong. The median of participants' projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months through July, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent. We still expect inflation to rise to 2 percent; the median projection is 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2021. However, inflation pressures clearly remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historical ranges. We are mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in longer-term inflation expectations. Overall, as we say in our postmeeting statement, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely. While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year. As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade policy uncertainty have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks. These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to shift our views about appropriate monetary policy over time toward a lower path for the federal funds rate, and this shift has supported the outlook. Of course, this is the role of monetary policy-to adjust interest rates to maintain a strong labor market and keep inflation near our 2 percent objective. Today's decision to lower the federal funds rate target by ¼ percent, to 1.75 percent to 2 percent, is appropriate in light of the global developments I mentioned as well as muted inflation pressures. Since our last meeting, we have seen additional signs of weakness abroad and a resurgence of trade policy tensions, including the imposition of additional tariffs. The Fed has no role in the formulation of trade policy, but we do take into account anything that could materially affect the economy relative to our employment and inflation goals. The future course of monetary policy will depend on how the economy evolves and what developments imply for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook. We have often said that policy is not on a preset course, and that is certainly the case today. As I have noted, the baseline economic outlook remains positive. The projections of appropriate policy show that participants generally anticipate only modest changes in the federal funds rate over the next couple of years. Of course, those views are merely forecasts and, as always, will evolve with the arrival of new information. Let me say a few words about our monetary policy operations. Funding pressures in money markets were elevated this week, and the effective federal funds rate rose above the top of its target range yesterday. While these issues are important for market functioning and market participants, they have no implications for the economy or the stance of monetary policy. This upward pressure emerged as funds flowed from the private sector to the Treasury to meet corporate tax payments and settle purchases of Treasury securities. To counter these pressures, we conducted overnight repurchase operations yesterday and again today. These temporary operations were effective in relieving funding pressures, and we expect the federal funds rate to move back into the target range. In addition, as we have done in the past, we made a technical adjustment to the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances, setting it 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In a related action, we also adjusted the rate on the overnight repurchase facility to 5 basis points below the bottom of the target range. We will continue to monitor market developments and will conduct operations as necessary to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates within the target range. Consistent with our decision earlier this year to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime, we will, over time, provide a sufficient supply of reserves so that frequent operations are not required. To summarize, we are fully committed to pursuing our goals of maximum employment and stable prices. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. Thanks. I'll be happy to take your questions."

"CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I are dedicated to serving the American people. We do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and stable prices. We're committed to making the best decisions we can based on facts and objective analysis. Today we decided to lower the interest rates for the third time this year. We took this step to help keep the U.S. economy strong in the face of global developments and to provide some insurance against ongoing risks. As I will explain shortly, the policy adjustments we have made since last year are providing-and will continue to provide-meaningful support to the economy. We believe that monetary policy is in a good place. The U.S. economy is in its 11th year of expansion, and the baseline outlook remains favorable. The overall economy is growing at a moderate rate. Household spending continues to be strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the economy to expand at a moderate rate, reflecting solid household spending and supportive financial conditions. The job market remains strong. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for a year and a half. The pace of job gains has eased this year but has remained solid; we had expected some slowing after last year's strong pace. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing, and wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now getting opportunities to add new and better chapters to their lives. This underscores for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months through August, total PCE inflation was 1.4 percent and core inflation was 1.8 percent. Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges. We're mindful that continued below-target inflation could lead to an unwelcome downward slide in long-term inflation expectations. However, against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent. Overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of economic activity, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely. While this has been our outlook for quite some time, our views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year. As I mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade developments have weighed on the economy and pose ongoing risks. These factors, in conjunction with muted inflation pressures, have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past year. In both July and September, we reduced the target rate [range] for the federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and we did so again today, bringing the range to 1½ to 1 percent. The policy adjustments we've made to date will continue to provide significant support for the economy. Since monetary policy operates with a lag, the full effects of these adjustments on economic growth, the job market, and inflation will be realized over time. We see the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate as long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. We believe monetary policy is in a good place to achieve these outcomes. Looking ahead, we'll be monitoring the effects of our policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course. Let me end with a few words about our technical monetary policy operations. In January, we made the key decision to continue to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime. In that operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting our administered rates, not through frequent interventions to actively manage the supply of reserves. In the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in our balance sheet in March and we stopped it in July. In response to the funding pressures in money markets that emerged in mid-September, we concluded that it would be appropriate to maintain, over a time-over time, a level of reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September of this year. To achieve this ample level, we announced on October 11 that we would purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year as well as continue temporary open market operations at least through January. These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of monetary policy as we continue to learn about the appropriate level of reserves. They do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. In particular, our Treasury bill purchases should not be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis. In those programs, we purchased longer-term securities to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and ease broader financial conditions. In contrast, increasing the supply of reserves by purchasing Treasury bills only alters the mix of short-term assets held by the public and should not materially affect demand and supply for longer-term securities or financial conditions more broadly. Thank you. I will be happy to take your questions. "

"CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, everyone. To begin, I'd like to say a few words about Paul Volcker, who, as you know, passed away earlier this week. Paul Volcker served as Federal Reserve Chair from 1979 to 1987. He accomplished many things during his long and distinguished career at the Fed and elsewhere. Of course, he's best known for leading the fight to tame the double-digit inflation that he inherited as Chair, thus laying the foundation for the prosperity and price stability we enjoy today. But what is perhaps most admirable about him-more than his many accomplishments-was his character. He believed that there is no higher calling than public service, and he dedicated the lion's share of his life to it. With courage, integrity, and tenacity, he always pursued the policies that he believed would ultimately benefit all Americans. My colleagues and I continue to draw inspiration from his example. Turning to today's meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged after lowering it a total of percentage point at the previous three meetings. As always, we base our decisions on judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability. Our economic outlook remains a favorable one despite global developments and ongoing risks. With our decisions through the course of the past year, we believe that monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent goal. The economic expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record. Household spending has been strong, supported by a healthy job market, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence. In contrast, business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the past year. As has been the case for some time, sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on those sectors. Even so, the overall economy has been growing moderately. And with a strong household sector and supportive monetary and financial conditions, we expect moderate growth to continue. As seen from FOMC participants' most recent projections, the median expectation for real GDP growth slows slightly over the next few years but remains near 2 percent. The unemployment rate has been near half-century lows for well more than a year, and the pace of job gains remains solid. Participation in the labor force by people in their prime working years, ages 25 through 54, has been increasing. And wages have been rising, particularly for lower-paying jobs. People who live and work in low- and middle-income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are now finding new opportunities. Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and ethnic groups and all levels of education. These developments underscore for us the importance of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind. We expect the job market to remain strong. The median of participants' projections for the unemployment rate remains below 4 percent over the next several years. Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective. Over the 12 months through October, total PCE inflation was 1.3 percent, and core inflation-which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation-was 1.6 percent. While low and stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead to an unhealthy dynamic in which longer-term inflation expectations drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower. In turn, interest rates would be lower as well and closer to their effective lower bound. As a result, the scope for interest rate reductions to support the economy in a future downturn would be diminished, resulting in worse economic outcomes for American families and businesses. Against the backdrop of a strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2 percent. The median of participants' projection rises to 1.9 percent next year and 2 percent in 2021. We're strongly committed to achieving our symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. Over the course of the past year, our views about the path of interest rates that would best achieve our employment and inflation objectives changed significantly, as the economy faced some important challenges from weaker global growth and trade developments. As the year progressed, we adjusted the stance of monetary policy to cushion the economy from these developments and to provide some insurance against the associated risks. In addition, inflation pressures were unexpectedly muted, strengthening the case for a more supportive stance of policy. Rather than modestly increasing the target rate for the federal funds rate this year, as seemed appropriate a year ago, we reduced it by percentage point. This shift has helped support the economy and has kept the outlook on track. The medians of participants' projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation are little changed from a year ago, aside from a lower inflation projection for 2019. Of course, that is the function of monetary policy-to adjust interest rates to promote employment and price stability in response to forces acting on the economy. We believe that the current stance of monetary policy will support sustained growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective. As long as incoming information about the economy remains broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy likely will remain appropriate. Looking ahead, we will be monitoring the effects of our recent policy actions, along with other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material reassessment of our outlook, we would respond accordingly. Policy is not on a preset course. Finally, I wanted to note that we've been purchasing Treasury bills and conducting repurchase operations, consistent with the plan we announced in December. These technical operations are aimed at maintaining an ample level of reserves and addressing money market pressures that could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. Our operations have gone well so far; pressures in money markets over recent weeks have been subdued. To address possible pressures in money markets over the year-end, we've been conducting term repo operations spanning year-end. We stand ready to adjust the details of our operations as appropriate to keep the federal funds rate in the target range. Thank you, and I'll be happy to take your questions. "
