AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (As amended effective January 29, 2019) OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 3 D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency. SECURITIES LENDING In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 2. market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and limitations on the iv. Subject to reasonable amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. B. The Selected Bank may: Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- i. cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 65 business days or less; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts.

The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com- mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur- rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori- zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con- duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera- tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. By unanimous vote, the Committee reaffirmed its Pro- gram for Security of FOMC Information. In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the refer- ence to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 4.6 percent to 4.4 percent. All participants supported the statement with the revision, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement. STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As amended effective January 29, 2019) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta- ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci- sions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer- tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society. Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan- cial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as- sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de- termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persis- tently above or below this objective. Communicating Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of signifi- cant economic disturbances. The maximum level of em- ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar- ket. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; ra- ther, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer- tain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem- ployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. For ex- ample, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.4 percent. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s as- sessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circum- stances in which the Committee judges that the objec- tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap- proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag- nitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate. The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi- zational meeting each January. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac- count (SOMA) provided an overview of developments in U.S. and global financial markets. Financial markets were quite volatile over the intermeeting period. Market participants pointed to a number of factors as contrib- uting to the heightened volatility and sustained declines in risk asset prices and interest rates over recent months including a weaker outlook and greater uncertainties for foreign economies (particularly for Europe and China), perceptions of greater policy risks, and the partial shut- down of the federal government. Against this backdrop, market participants appeared to interpret FOMC com- munications at the time of the December meeting as not fully appreciating the tightening of financial conditions and the associated downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook that had emerged since the fall. In addition, some market reports suggested that investors perceived the FOMC to be insufficiently flexible in its approach to adjusting the path for the federal funds rate or the pro- cess for balance sheet normalization in light of those risks. The deterioration in risk sentiment late in Decem- ber was reportedly amplified by poor liquidity and thin trading conditions around year-end. Early in the new year, market sentiment improved fol- lowing communications by Federal Reserve officials em- phasizing that the Committee could be “patient” in con- sidering further adjustments to the stance of policy and that it would be flexible in managing the reduction of securities holdings in the SOMA. On balance, stock prices finished the period up almost 5 percent while cor- porate risk spreads narrowed, reversing a portion of the changes in these variables since the September FOMC meeting. The deputy manager reported results from the Open Market Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and mar- ket participants. Regarding the outlook for policy, the median path for the federal funds rate among respond- ents had shifted down about 25 basis points relative to the responses from the surveys conducted ahead of the December meeting. Moreover, the average probability that respondents attached to an increase in the target range as the next policy action declined and the corre- sponding probabilities they attached to the possibility that the target range would be unchanged or lowered at some point this year increased. Concerning expectations for the FOMC statement, many survey respondents an- ticipated the retention of language pointing to the likeli- hood of “some further gradual increases” in the target range for the federal funds rate but many also expected the statement to emphasize patience or data dependence in the conduct of policy. Consistent with recent com- munications that the FOMC would be flexible in its ap- proach to balance sheet normalization, the survey results also suggested that the respondents anticipated that the Committee would slow the balance sheet runoff in sce- narios that involved a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate. In reviewing money market developments, the deputy manager noted that federal funds continued to trade at rates close to the interest on excess reserves rate. More- _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 9 over, no signs of reserve scarcity were evident in the be- havior of the federal funds rate; the correlation between daily changes in reserve balances and the federal funds rate remained close to zero. In other markets, repur- chase agreement (repo) rates spiked at year-end, report- edly reflecting strong demands for financing from deal- ers associated with large Treasury auction net settle- ments on that day combined with a cutback in the supply of financing available from banks and others managing the size of their balance sheets over year-end for report- ing purposes. The deputy manager noted that the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York was planning to release a notice in early February for public comment on plans to include new data on selected deposits in the calcula- tion of the overnight bank funding rate (OBFR). In ad- dition, the staff had begun work aimed at publishing a series of backward-looking average secured overnight fi- nancing rates (SOFR) as a further step to support refer- ence rate reform. The staff planned to solicit public feedback on this effort later this year and initiate publi- cation of these averages by the first half of 2020. Following the briefing, participants raised a number of questions about market reports that the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet runoff and associated “quantitative tightening” had been an important factor contributing to the selloff in equity markets in the closing months of last year. While respondents assessed that the reduction of securities held in the SOMA would put some modest upward pressure on Treasury yields and agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) yields over time, they gen- erally placed little weight on balance sheet reduction as a prime factor spurring the deterioration in risk sentiment over that period. However, some other investors report- edly held firmly to the belief that the runoff of the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings was a factor putting significant downward pressure on risky asset prices, and the investment decisions of these investors, particularly in thin market conditions around the year-end, might have had an outsized effect on market prices for a time. Participants also discussed the hypothesis that investors may have taken some signal about the future path of the federal funds rate based on perceptions that the Federal Reserve was unwilling to adjust the pace of balance sheet runoff in light of economic and financial developments. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation Frameworks Committee participants resumed their discussion from the December 2018 meeting of the appropriate long-run framework for monetary policy implementation. At the January meeting, the staff provided briefings on the ef- fectiveness and efficiency of the Committee’s current operating regime and on options for transitioning to the longer-run size of the balance sheet. The staff noted that the Committee had previously indi- cated that, in the longer run, it intends to operate with no more securities holdings than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. In consider- ing the effectiveness of the operating regime, the staff observed that over recent years, the Federal Reserve had been able to implement monetary policy in an environ- ment with ample reserves by adjusting administered rates—including the rates on required and excess reserve balances and the offered rate at the overnight reverse re- purchase agreement facility—without needing to ac- tively manage the supply of reserves. Over this period, the effective federal funds rate was generally steady at levels well within the Committee’s target range despite substantial changes in the level of reserves in the banking system and significant changes in money markets, regu- lations, and financial institutions’ business models. In addition, other money market rates generally moved closely with the federal funds rate. The current regime was therefore effective both in providing control of the policy rate and in ensuring transmission of the policy stance to other rates and broader financial markets. The staff briefing also included a discussion of factors relevant in judging the level of reserves that would sup- port the efficient implementation of monetary policy. The staff suggested that maintaining a buffer of reserves above the minimum quantity that corresponds to the flat portion of the reserve demand curve could reduce the size and frequency of open market operations needed to maintain good control of the policy rate. The aggregate level of reserves had already declined by $1.2 trillion from a peak level of $2.8 trillion reached in October 2014; the decline stemmed from both reductions in asset holdings and increases in nonreserve liabilities such as Federal Reserve notes in circulation. Some recent survey information and other evidence suggested that reserves might begin to approach an efficient level later this year. Against this backdrop, the staff presented options for substantially slowing the decline in reserves by ending the reduction in asset holdings at some point over the latter half of this year and thereafter holding the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time so that Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the average level of reserves would fall at a very gradual pace reflecting the trend growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities. The staff also described options for communicating plans both for the operating regime and for the comple- tion of the normalization of the size of the balance sheet. If the Committee reached a decision to continue using its current operating regime, announcing this decision after the current meeting would help reduce uncertainty about both the long-run implementation framework and the likely evolution of the balance sheet. In addition, the Committee could revise its previous communications to make clear that it was flexible in its approach to normal- izing the balance sheet and was prepared to change the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to support the FOMC’s broader policy goals. The staff noted that, after the end of asset redemptions, the Desk could reinvest principal payments received from hold- ings of agency MBS in Treasury securities as directed. Participants noted some of the key advantages of the Federal Reserve’s current operating regime, including good control of the policy rate in a variety of conditions and good transmission to other money market rates and broader financial markets. They observed that a regime that controlled the policy rate through active manage- ment of the supply of reserves likely would have disad- vantages. In particular, the level and variability of re- serve demand and supply were likely to be much larger than in the period before the crisis, and stabilizing the policy rate in this environment would require large and frequent open market operations. Participants judged that, in light of their extensive previous discussions, it was now appropriate to provide the public with more certainty that the Federal Reserve would continue to use its current operating regime. Choosing an operating re- gime would also allow the Committee to move forward on related issues, including plans for concluding the nor- malization of the size of the balance sheet. Participants emphasized the importance of describing their chosen operating regime in clear terms to enhance public under- standing. Participants discussed market commentary that sug- gested that the process of balance sheet normalization might be influencing financial markets. Participants noted that the ongoing reduction in the Federal Re- serve’s asset holdings had proceeded smoothly for more than a year, with no significant effects on financial mar- kets. The gradual reduction in securities holdings had been announced well in advance and, as intended, was proceeding largely in the background, with the federal funds rate remaining the Committee’s primary tool for adjusting the stance of policy. Nonetheless, some inves- tors might have interpreted previous communications as indicating that a very high threshold would have to be met before the Committee would be willing to adjust its balance sheet normalization plans. Participants ob- served that, although the target range for the federal funds rate was the Committee’s primary means of ad- justing the stance of policy, the balance sheet normaliza- tion process should proceed in a way that supports the achievement of the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Con- sistent with this principle, participants agreed that it was important to be flexible in managing the process of bal- ance sheet normalization, and that it would be appropri- ate to adjust the details of balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments if necessary to achieve the Committee’s macroeconomic objectives. Almost all participants thought that it would be desirable to announce before too long a plan to stop reducing the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings later this year. Such an announcement would provide more certainty about the process for completing the normalization of the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. A substantial ma- jority expected that when asset redemptions ended, the level of reserves would likely be somewhat larger than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy; if so, many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves, re- flecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as Fed- eral Reserve notes in circulation, could be appropriate. In these participants’ view, this process would allow the Federal Reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of short-term interest rates without needing to engage in more fre- quent open market operations. A few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing re- serves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs, such as an undue risk of volatility in short-term interest rates, that would exceed its benefits. These participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions, the Federal Reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in non- reserve liabilities, so as to keep the average level of re- serves relatively stable. A couple of participants sug- gested that a ceiling facility to mitigate temporary unex- pected pressures in reserve markets could play a useful role in supporting policy implementation at lower levels of reserves. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 11 Participants commented that, in light of the Committee’s longstanding plan to hold primarily Treasury securities in the long run, it would be appropriate once asset re- demptions end to reinvest most, if not all, principal pay- ments received from agency MBS in Treasury securities. Some thought that continuing to reinvest agency MBS principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month in agency MBS, as under the current balance sheet normal- ization plan, would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large de- clines in long-term interest rates caused agency MBS prepayment speeds to increase sharply. However, some others judged that retaining the cap on agency MBS re- demptions was unnecessary at this stage in the normali- zation process. These participants noted considerations in support of this view, including that principal payments were unlikely to reach the $20 billion level after 2019, that the cap could slightly slow the return to a portfolio of primarily Treasury securities, or that the Committee would have the flexibility to adjust the details of its bal- ance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments. Participants commented that it would be important over time to develop and communi- cate plans for reinvesting agency MBS principal pay- ments, and they expected to continue their discussion of balance sheet normalization and related issues at upcom- ing meetings. Following the discussion, the Chairman proposed that the Committee communicate its intentions regarding monetary policy implementation and its willingness to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization pro- gram by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting. All participants agreed with the proposed statement. STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION (Adopted January 30, 2019) After extensive deliberations and thorough re- view of experience to date, the Committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional infor- mation regarding its plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run. Additionally, the Committee is re- vising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet nor- malization program.5 Accordingly, all participants agreed to the following: • The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample sup- ply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. • The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy. The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the de- tails for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments. Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by re- ducing the federal funds rate. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the January 29–30 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen and that growth in real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, although the availability of data was more limited than usual because of the partial federal government shut- down that extended from December 22 to January 25. Consumer price the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), was a bit below 2 percent in November, held down in part by recent de- Survey-based clines in consumer energy prices. inflation, as measured by 5 The Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were adopted on September 16, 2014, and are available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypol- icy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.pdf. On March 18, 2015, the Committee adopted an addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypol- icy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20150318.pdf. On June 13, 2017, the Committee adopted a second addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypol- icy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf. Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in December. The national unemployment rate edged up but was still at a low level of 3.9 percent, while the labor force participation rate also increased somewhat; as a re- sult, the employment-to-population ratio remained steady in December. The unemployment rates for Afri- can Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in December were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, although persistent differentials in unem- ployment rates across groups remained. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons con- tinued to be close to the lows reached in late 2007. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits edged down in November but were still at high levels; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through the middle of January were near historically low levels. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.2 per- cent over the 12 months ending in December. Industrial production increased solidly in December. Output gains were strong in the manufacturing and min- ing sectors, while the output of utilities declined, with warmer-than-usual temperatures lowering the demand for heating. Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would ease somewhat in the first quarter, although new orders in- dexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in overall factory output in the coming months. Household spending looked to have increased strongly in the fourth quarter, as real PCE growth was strong in October and November. The release of the retail sales report for December was delayed, but available indica- tors—such as credit card and debit card transaction data and light motor vehicle sales—suggested that household spending growth remained strong in December. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and still-elevated measures of households’ net worth—con- tinued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was less upbeat in early January than it had been last year but re- mained at a generally favorable level. Real residential investment appeared to have declined again in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part de- creases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing, though somewhat slower, house price appreciation. Data on starts and permits for new resi- dential construction in December were not available, but building permit issuance for new single-family homes— which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homes—had moved down modestly in the previous couple of months. Sales of ex- isting homes decreased, on net, over November and De- cember, while data on new home sales for those two months were delayed. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property looked to have picked up solidly in the fourth quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose, on bal- ance, in October and November, while information on shipments for December was delayed; available indica- tors of transportation equipment spending in the fourth quarter were strong. Forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending—such as orders for non- defense capital goods excluding aircraft and readings on business sentiment—pointed to somewhat slower spending gains in the near term. Data on nominal busi- ness expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector in November were not available. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—was roughly flat in December and through most of January. Total real government purchases appeared to have in- creased moderately in the fourth quarter. Nominal de- fense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases, although spending data for December were delayed. The partial federal government shutdown restrained real federal purchases somewhat in the fourth quarter and likely had a more significant negative effect on federal purchases in the first quarter. Real purchases by state and local govern- ments looked to have risen modestly in the fourth quar- ter, as the payrolls of those governments expanded a bit over that period. Nominal state and local construction spending had risen solidly in October, but construction data for November were delayed. Data on U.S. international trade for November and De- cember also were delayed. The available data for Octo- ber suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percent- age points in the third quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Core PCE price inflation, which _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 13 excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed. Recent data suggested that foreign economic growth was subdued in the fourth quarter relative to earlier in the year. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), espe- cially the euro area, indicators of economic activity weak- ened further, though they remained consistent with pos- itive economic growth. In the emerging market econo- mies (EMEs), growth in Mexico and Brazil appeared to have slowed to a modest pace in the fourth quarter after a temporary pickup in the third quarter. The Chinese economy expanded at a slower pace than earlier in the year amid notable weakness in household spending, and Chinese imports from other emerging Asian economies turned down. Foreign inflation fell in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting lower oil prices. Inflation pressures, es- pecially in some AFEs, generally remained muted. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor risk sentiment fluctuated materially over the in- termeeting period. A variety of factors—including FOMC communications, weaker-than-expected data, trade policy uncertainties, the partial federal government shutdown, and concerns about the outlook for corpo- rate earnings—were cited by market participants as con- tributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment early in the period. During this time, broad equity indexes declined substantially amid a sharp rise in financial market vola- tility, and corporate bond spreads widened notably. Subsequently, positive signals regarding trade policy, ro- bust economic data releases, and communications from FOMC participants led to an improvement in risk senti- ment. On net, the S&P 500 index rose, option-implied volatility—the VIX—fell, Treasury yields declined, and corporate spreads narrowed over the intermeeting pe- riod. Despite the intermeeting moves in financial mar- kets, financial conditions remained notably tighter than in September 2018. Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit further over the inter- meeting period but remained generally supportive of spending. December FOMC communications were reportedly per- ceived by market participants as not fully appreciating the implications of tighter financial conditions and sof- tening global data over recent months for the U.S. eco- nomic outlook. Subsequent communications from FOMC participants were interpreted as suggesting that the FOMC would be patient in assessing the implica- tions of recent economic and financial developments. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2019 was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and investors continued to expect no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at the January FOMC meeting. The market-implied path for 2020 shifted down somewhat. Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated substantially, with heightened risk aversion contributing to a significant de- cline in yields early in the intermeeting period. Subse- quently, yields rose, though 2-, 5-, and 10-year yields still ended the period somewhat lower, on net. The spread between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed over the period, and re- mained in the lower end of its historical range over re- cent decades. The near-term forward spread—the dif- ference between the current implied three-month for- ward rate at a horizon six quarters ahead (derived from the Treasury yield curve) and the current yield on a three-month Treasury bill—narrowed, on net, and also was in the lower end of its historical distribution. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year-forward inflation compensation measures based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securi- ties (TIPS) edged down a bit over the period; both measures were down significantly from levels prevailing in the fall of last year. In U.S. risky asset markets, the S&P 500 equity index was down as much as 8 percent at one point during the pe- riod but ended the period notably higher. On net, the VIX fell substantially while corporate bond spreads nar- rowed a bit. The federal funds rate and other overnight funding rates rose following the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting. Year-end pressures in repo markets were reportedly ex- acerbated by a high volume of settlements of Treasury securities against a backdrop of large dealer inventories and reduced intermediation by global systemically im- portant banks. General collateral repo rates moved up sharply at year-end but subsequently returned to normal levels. Foreign financial markets followed the same general pat- tern as those in the United States. On balance, foreign equity prices moved up moderately and sovereign credit Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ spreads in EMEs narrowed. Moreover, inflows to dedi- cated emerging market funds resumed after two quarters of outflows. Longer-term sovereign yields in AFEs edged lower on net. The dollar depreciated broadly amid falling U.S. yields and greater investor optimism about prospects for some EMEs. The dollar depreciated notably against the Brit- ish pound, on net, as market participants reportedly saw an increased likelihood of a delay in the Brexit process. The dollar also depreciated considerably against the Bra- zilian real and the Mexican peso following progress on pension reform in Brazil and a fiscal announcement in Mexico that was perceived as prudent. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms tightened somewhat, on balance. Gross issuance of corporate bonds slowed considerably in December across the credit rating spectrum but rebounded in January. Even so, the volume of high-yield bonds issued by nonfinan- cial firms remained well below its average over the past few years. Spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds were volatile but narrowed a bit, on net, and stayed at levels well above those that prevailed a year ago. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of deterioration, although actual corporate bond defaults remained low overall. Institutional lever- aged loan issuance slowed in December to its lowest level since July 2016, as loan spreads widened substan- tially. Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond mar- kets stayed accommodative on net. Private-sector analysts significantly revised down their projections for corporate earnings for the fourth quarter and for 2019 as a whole. The pace of gross equity issu- ance through both initial and seasoned offerings was sluggish in December, amid reports that several firms may have pushed back initial equity offerings. Respondents to the January 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) re- ported that lending standards for commercial and indus- trial (C&I) loans remained basically unchanged in the fourth quarter, after having reported easing standards over the past several quarters. Growth of C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets picked up in the fourth quarter, reflecting stronger originations as well as reduced pay- downs and loan sales. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained accommodative. Although com- mercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) spreads were volatile, they were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, and issuance of both agency and non-agency CMBS remained strong. CRE loan growth at banks continued to expand at a pace comparable with that seen over the course of 2018. Banks in the January SLOOS reported that demand was unchanged, on net, in the fourth quarter for nonfarm nonresidential loans, the largest CRE loan category, while demand was report- edly weaker for multifamily loans and construction loans. On balance, banks reported tightening their standards for all types of CRE loans in the fourth quar- ter. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers. Pur- chase mortgage origination activity continued to decline modestly through November, while refinancing activity continued to be muted. In consumer credit markets, financing conditions tight- ened a bit but, on balance, remained generally supportive of growth in household spending. Banks reported in the SLOOS that they tightened credit card lending standards during the fourth quarter. In the consumer asset-backed securities market, spreads widened somewhat amid broad market volatility. The staff provided an update on its views with respect to potential risks to financial stability. The increase in financial market volatility seen over the fall of last year was characterized as a return to historically more typical levels, following the historically low-volatility environ- ment that persisted through much of 2017 and 2018. However, the increase in volatility in financial markets in December was viewed as substantial and as likely exac- erbated by thin year-end liquidity, among other factors. Staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and cor- porate debt markets to have abated somewhat in the pe- riod since the assessment presented in the November 2018 financial stability report. Staff continued to moni- tor developments in the leveraged loan market given the sharp rise in spreads and slowdown in issuance late last year. The build-up in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector. Staff continued to judge risks asso- ciated with household-sector debt as moderate. Both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vul- nerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low, as they have been for some time. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was revised down a little, on balance, primarily reflecting somewhat lower projected _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 15 paths for domestic equity prices and foreign economic growth. The staff estimated that U.S. real GDP growth was solid in the fourth quarter of last year, bolstered by consumer spending and business investment, and that the effects of the partial federal government shutdown were quite small in that quarter. Real GDP growth was expected to slow but remain solid in the first half of this year, with the effects of the partial federal government shutdown modestly restraining GDP growth in the first quarter and those effects being reversed in the second quarter. In the medium term, real GDP growth in 2019 was forecast to be at a rate above the staff’s esti- mate of potential output growth, step down to the growth rate of potential output next year and then slow further to a pace below potential output growth in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to decline some- what further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021. With labor market conditions judged to already be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unem- ployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. The staff’s forecast for inflation was little revised for the January FOMC meeting. Core PCE price inflation was still expected to step up to 2 percent over this year as a whole and then to run at that level through the medium term. Total PCE price inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation this year and next, reflecting pro- jected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation in 2021. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. On the upside, household spending and business invest- ment could expand faster than the staff projected, sup- ported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the downside, trade policies and foreign economic develop- ments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The up- side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the pos- sibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign eco- nomic conditions deteriorated. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that over the intermeeting period the labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco- nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had remained near 2 percent. Although mar- ket-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years. Participants generally continued to expect the growth rate of real GDP in 2019 to step down somewhat from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate closer to their estimates of longer-run growth, with a few participants commenting that waning fiscal stimulus was expected to contribute to the step-down. Several participants com- mented that they had nudged down their outlooks for output growth since the December meeting, citing a sof- tening in consumer or business sentiment, a reduction in the outlook for foreign economic growth, or the tight- ening in financial conditions that had occurred in recent months. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that recent data on spending had been strong, sup- ported by a strong job market and rising incomes. A couple of participants commented that contacts in their Districts remained optimistic about consumer spending. However, some participants noted the recent softening in surveys of consumer sentiment. Participants ob- served that the recent partial federal government shut- down had presented a significant hardship for many families. A few participants also pointed to continued weakness in the housing sector, which was attributed in part to concerns about affordability among potential homebuyers. Participants noted that growth of business fixed invest- ment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year. Some participants highlighted that recent surveys of business sentiment or District contacts had indicated some weakening in optimism or confidence about the economic outlook, though available indicators suggested Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ that the level of business sentiment had remained high. Concerns about the economic outlook were variously at- tributed to uncertainty or worries about slowing global economic growth, including in Europe and China; trade policy; waning fiscal policy stimulus; and the partial gov- ernment shutdown. Manufacturing contacts in a num- ber of Districts indicated that such factors were causing them to delay or defer capital expenditures. In addition, a few participants noted that recent declines in oil or gas- oline prices had damped plans for capital expenditures in the energy sector. A few participants observed that conditions in the agricultural sector remained difficult, citing large inventories of agricultural commodities, un- certainty about international trade policies, and concerns regarding low prices of commodities and farmland. However, a few participants commented that business optimism had increased among contacts in their Dis- tricts, or that they were planning new capital expendi- tures. Participants observed that both overall inflation and in- flation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. Participants con- tinued to view inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome. Some participants noted that some factors, such as the decline in oil prices, slower growth and softer inflation abroad, or appreciation of the dollar last year, had held down some recent inflation readings and may continue to do so this year. In addition, many participants commented that upward pressures on inflation appeared to be more muted than they appeared to be last year despite strengthening labor market conditions and rising input costs for some industries. In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta- tions, participants noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months. Participants expressed a range of views in in- terpreting the decline in inflation compensation. On the one hand, that decline could stem from a decrease in ex- pected inflation on the part of market participants. In that case, the current low levels of inflation compensa- tion could suggest that inflation expectations are below the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. On the other hand, the decline in inflation compensation might reflect in large part declines in risk premiums or in- creased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for inflation. This interpretation was seen as consistent with the behavior of the most recent survey-based measures of expected inflation, which were little changed. In their discussion of labor markets, participants agreed that conditions had continued to strengthen. Estimates of job gains in the December employment report had been strong, the unemployment rate had remained low, and the labor force participation rate had moved up. Several participants noted solid rates of hiring or other indicators of tight labor market conditions in their Dis- tricts. Some participants commented on recent indica- tors at the national or District levels as suggesting a pickup in wage growth. The pickup was attributed to tightening in national or District labor market conditions or to gains in the rate of productivity growth. Continued solid productivity growth was seen as a key factor nec- essary to support rising real wages over time. Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation over the medium term. Participants noted that some risks to the downside had increased, in- cluding the possibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, a rapid waning of fiscal policy stim- ulus, or a further tightening of financial market condi- tions. An increase in some foreign and domestic gov- ernment policy uncertainties, including those associated with Brexit, an escalation in international trade policy tensions, and the potential for additional extended fed- eral government shutdowns were also cited as downside risks. A few participants expressed concern that longer- run inflation expectations may be lower than levels con- sistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec- tive. Several participants judged that risks that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation had diminished relative to downside risks. The potential that various sources of uncertainty might abate more quickly than ex- pected was mentioned as a potential upside risk for the economic outlook. In their discussion of financial developments, partici- pants noted that although financial market conditions had not changed much, on net, over the intermeeting period, prices had been volatile and financial conditions were materially tighter than they had been several months ago, with lower equity prices and wider corpo- rate risk spreads. Several participants also noted that the slope of the Treasury yield curve was unusually flat by historical standards, which in the past had often been as- sociated with a deterioration in future macroeconomic performance. Participants noted that financial asset prices appeared to be sensitive to information regarding trade policy tensions, domestic fiscal and monetary pol- icy, and global economic growth prospects. A couple of _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 17 participants noted that the rise in credit spreads over re- cent months, if it were to persist, could restrain future economic activity. Participants agreed that it was im- portant to continue to monitor financial market devel- opments and assess the implications of these develop- ments for the economic outlook. Among those participants who commented on financial stability, a number expressed concerns about the ele- vated financial market volatility and the apparent decline in investors’ willingness to bear risk that occurred to- ward the end of last year. Although these conditions had eased somewhat in recent weeks, a couple of participants noted that the strain in financial markets might have per- sisted or spread if it had occurred during a period of less favorable macroeconomic conditions. A couple of par- ticipants highlighted the role that decreased liquidity at the end of the year appeared to play in exacerbating changes in financial market conditions. They empha- sized the need to monitor financial market structures or practices that may contribute to strained liquidity condi- tions. A few participants highlighted the importance of ensuring that financial institutions were able to with- stand adverse financial market events—for instance, by maintaining adequate levels of capital. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that information received since De- cember indicated that real economic activity had been rising at a solid rate, labor market conditions had contin- ued to strengthen, and inflation had been near the Com- mittee’s objective. Participants generally expected eco- nomic activity to continue expanding at a solid pace in the period ahead, with strong labor market conditions and inflation near 2 percent. At the time of the Decem- ber meeting, the Committee had noted that it would continue to monitor global economic and financial de- velopments and assess their implications for the eco- nomic outlook. Participants observed that since then, the economic outlook had become more uncertain. Fi- nancial market volatility had remained elevated over the intermeeting period, and, despite some easing since the December FOMC meeting, overall financial conditions had tightened since September. In addition, the global economy had continued to record slower growth, and consumer and business sentiment had deteriorated. The government policy environment, including trade negoti- ations and the recent partial federal government shut- down, was also seen as a factor contributing to uncer- tainty about the economic outlook. Based on their current assessments, all participants ex- pressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. With regard to the Committee’s postmeeting statement, participants sup- ported a proposed change in the forward guidance lan- guage that would replace the previous guidance referring to “some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate” with an indication that, in light of “global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures,” the Committee would “be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropri- ate.” Participants also supported a proposal to remove from the statement the characterization of risks to the economic outlook as “roughly balanced.” Participants pointed to a variety of considerations that supported a patient approach to monetary policy at this juncture as an appropriate step in managing various risks and uncertainties in the outlook. With regard to the do- mestic economic picture, additional data would help pol- icymakers gauge the trajectory of business and consumer sentiment, whether the recent softness in core and total inflation and inflation compensation would persist, and the effect of the tightening of financial conditions on ag- gregate demand. Information arriving in coming months could also shed light on the effects of the recent partial federal government shutdown on the U.S. econ- omy and on the results of the budget negotiations occur- ring in the wake of the shutdown, including the possible implications for the path of fiscal policy. A patient ap- proach would have the added benefit of giving policy- makers an opportunity to judge the response of eco- nomic activity and inflation to the recent steps taken to normalize the stance of monetary policy. Furthermore, a patient posture would allow time for a clearer picture of the international trade policy situation and the state of the global economy to emerge and, in particular, could allow policymakers to reach a firmer judgment about the extent and persistence of the economic slow- down in Europe and China. Participants noted that maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for a time posed few risks at this point. The current level of the federal funds rate was at the lower end of the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate. Moreover, inflation pressures were muted, and asset valuations were less stretched than they had been a few months earlier. Many participants sug- gested that it was not yet clear what adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropri- ate later this year; several of these participants argued that rate increases might prove necessary only if inflation outcomes were higher than in their baseline outlook. Page 18Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Several other participants indicated that, if the economy evolved as they expected, they would view it as appro- priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate later this year. Participants observed that a patient posture in these cir- cumstances was consistent with their general approach to setting the stance of policy, in which they were im- portantly guided by the implications of incoming data for the economic outlook. Some participants noted that, while global economic and financial developments had been important factors leading to a patient monetary policy posture, those developments mattered because they affected assessments of the policy rate path most consistent with achievement of the Committee’s dual- mandate goals of maximum employment and price sta- bility. Many participants observed that if uncertainty abated, the Committee would need to reassess the char- acterization of monetary policy as “patient” and might then use different statement language. A few participants expressed concerns that in the current environment of increased uncertainty, the policy rate projections prepared as part of the Summary of Eco- nomic Projections (SEP) do not accurately convey the Committee’s policy outlook. These participants were concerned that, although the individual participants’ projections for the federal funds rate in the SEP reflect their individual views of the appropriate path for the pol- icy rate conditional on the evolution of the economic outlook, at times the public had misinterpreted the me- dian or central tendency of those projections as repre- senting the consensus view of the Committee or as sug- gesting that policy was on a preset course. However, some other participants noted that the policy rate pro- jections in the SEP are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace ear- lier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy re- mained near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. In their consideration of the economic outlook, mem- bers noted that financial conditions had tightened, on net, since September, and that global growth had mod- erated; members also observed that a number of uncer- tainties, including those pertaining to the evolution of policies of the U.S. and foreign governments, still awaited resolution. However, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Commit- tee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee could be pa- tient as it determined what future adjustments to the tar- get range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com- mittee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into ac- count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and readings on finan- cial and international developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term ad- justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro- priately remain dependent on the evolution of the out- look as informed by incoming data. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to change the characterization of recent growth in economic activity from “strong” to “solid,” consistent with incoming information that suggested that the pace of expansion of the U.S. economy had moderated some- what since late last year. The description of indicators of inflation expectations was revised to recognize that the downward moves in market-based measures of in- flation compensation that occurred in recent months had been sustained, while also noting that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit- tle changed. Members also agreed to several adjust- ments in the description of the outlook for the economy _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 29–30, 2019Page 19 and monetary policy. The statement language was re- vised to indicate that the Committee continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near 2 percent as “the most likely outcomes.” Members also agreed to add a sentence indicating that, in light of “global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what fu- ture adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.” This sentence was intended to convey the Committee’s view that a patient and flexible approach was appropriate at this time as a way to manage risks while assessing in- coming information bearing on the economic outlook. In light of the range of uncertainties associated with global economic and financial developments, the Com- mittee decided that it was not useful at this time to ex- press a judgment about the balance of risks. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 31, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to in agency mortgage- continue reinvesting backed securities the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are ac- ceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates labor market has continued to that the strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate has remained low. Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has mod- erated from its rapid pace earlier last year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and infla- tion for items other than food and energy re- main near 2 percent. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of Page 20Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren.

Balance Sheet Normalization Committee participants resumed their discussion from the January 2019 meeting on options for transitioning to the longer-run size of the balance sheet. The staff de- scribed options for ending the reduction in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at the end of September 2019 and for potentially reducing the pace of redemp- tions of Treasury securities before that date. Reducing the pace of redemptions before ending them would be consistent with most previous changes in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policy and would support a grad- ual transition to the long-run level of reserves. It could also reinforce the Committee’s communications indicat- ing that the FOMC was flexible in its plans for balance sheet normalization and that the process of balance sheet normalization would remain consistent with the at- tainment of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy ob- jectives. However, continuing redemptions at the cur- rent pace through September might be simpler to com- municate and would somewhat shorten the transition to the long-run level of reserves. The staff noted that re- ducing the pace of redemptions before September would leave reserves and the balance sheet slightly larger than continuing redemptions at the current pace through September. However, the longer-run level of reserves and size of the balance sheet would ultimately be deter- mined by long-term demand for Federal Reserve liabili- ties. Staff projections of term premiums and macroeco- nomic outcomes did not differ substantially across the two options. The staff also described a possible interim plan for rein- vesting principal payments received from agency debt Page 3 Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) after bal- ance sheet runoff ends and until the Committee decides on the longer-run composition of the System Open Mar- ket Account (SOMA) portfolio. Consistent with the Committee’s long-standing aim to hold primarily Treas- ury securities in the longer run, any principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS would generally be re- invested in Treasury securities in the secondary market. These reinvestments would be allocated across sectors of the Treasury market roughly in proportion to the ma- turity composition of Treasury securities outstanding. However, the plan would maintain the existing $20 bil- lion per month cap on MBS redemptions; principal pay- ments on agency debt and agency MBS above $20 billion per month would continue to be reinvested in agency MBS. This cap would limit the pace at which the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS holdings could decline if prepay- ments accelerated; the staff projected that the redemp- tion cap on agency debt and agency MBS was unlikely to be reached after 2019. The staff noted that, once balance sheet runoff ended, the average level of reserves would tend to decline grad- ually, in line with trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s nonreserve liabilities, until the Committee chose to re- sume growth of the balance sheet in order to maintain a level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation. Participants judged that ending the runoff of securities holdings at the end of September would reduce uncer- tainty about the Federal Reserve’s plans for its securities holdings and would be consistent with the Committee’s decision at its January 2019 meeting to continue imple- menting monetary policy in a regime of ample reserves. Participants discussed advantages and disadvantages of slowing balance sheet runoff before the September stop- ping date. A slowing in the pace of redemptions would accord with the Committee’s general practice of adjust- ing its holdings of securities smoothly and predictably, which might reduce the risk that market volatility would arise in connection with the conclusion of the runoff of securities holdings. However, these advantages needed to be weighed against the additional complexity of a plan that would end balance sheet runoff in steps rather than all at once. Participants reiterated their support for the FOMC’s in- tention to return to holding primarily Treasury securities in the long run. Participants judged that adopting an in- terim approach for reinvesting agency debt and agency MBS principal payments into Treasury securities across a range of maturities was appropriate while the Commit- tee continued to evaluate potential long-run maturity structures for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio of Treas- ury securities. Many participants offered preliminary views on advantages and disadvantages of alternative compositions for the SOMA portfolio. Participants ex- pected to further discuss the longer-run composition of the portfolio at upcoming meetings. Participants commented on considerations related to al- lowing the average level of reserves to decline in line with trend growth in nonreserve liabilities for a time af- ter the end of balance sheet runoff. Several participants preferred to stabilize the average level of reserves by re- suming purchases of Treasury securities relatively soon after the end of runoff, because they saw little benefit to further declines in reserve balances or because they thought the Committee should minimize the risk of in- terest rate volatility that could occur if the supply of re- serves dropped below a point consistent with efficient and effective implementation of policy. Some others preferred to allow the average level of reserves to con- tinue to decline for a longer time after balance sheet run- off ends because such declines could allow the Commit- tee to learn more about underlying reserve demand, be- cause they judged that such a process was not likely to result in excessive volatility in money market rates, or because they judged that moving to lower levels of re- serves was more consistent with the Committee’s previ- ous communications indicating that it would hold no more securities than necessary for implementing mone- tary policy efficiently and effectively. Participants noted that the eventual resumption of purchases of securities to keep pace with growth in demand for the Federal Re- serve’s liabilities, whenever it occurred, would be a nor- mal part of operations to maintain the ample-reserves monetary policy implementation regime and would not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. Some participants suggested that, at future meetings, the Committee should discuss the potential benefits and costs of tools that might reduce reserve demand or sup- port interest rate control. Following the discussion, the Chair proposed that the Committee communicate its intentions regarding bal- ance sheet normalization by publishing a statement at the conclusion of the meeting. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to issue the proposed statement. Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION PRINCIPLES AND PLANS (Adopted March 20, 2019) In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the progress in normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings and the level of reserves in the bank- ing system, all participants agreed that it is appropriate at this time for the Committee to provide additional infor- mation regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating regime. At its January meeting, the Committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s adminis- tered rates and in which active management of the sup- ply of reserves is not required. The Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization released in January as well as the princi- ples and plans listed below together revise and replace the Committee’s earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans. (cid:120) To ensure a smooth transition to the longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effec- tive policy implementation, the Committee intends to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over com- ing quarters provided that the economy and money market conditions evolve about as expected. o The Committee intends to slow the reduction of its holdings of Treasury securities by reduc- ing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of $30 billion to $15 billion begin- ning in May 2019. o The Committee intends to conclude the reduc- tion of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of September 2019. o The Committee intends to continue to allow its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) to decline, consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury se- curities in the longer run. (cid:131) Beginning in October 2019, principal pay- ments received from agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in Treasury securities subject to a maximum amount of (cid:131) (cid:131) $20 billion per month; any principal pay- ments in excess of that maximum will con- tinue to be reinvested in agency MBS. Principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS below the $20 billion maxi- mum will initially be invested in Treasury securities across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; the Com- mittee will revisit this reinvestment plan in connection with its deliberations regarding the longer-run composition of the SOMA portfolio. It continues to be the Committee’s view that limited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings. The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance. o The average level of reserves after the FOMC has concluded the reduction of its aggregate se- curities holdings at the end of September will likely still be somewhat above the level of re- serves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy. (cid:131) In that case, the Committee currently antic- ipates that it will likely hold the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time. During such a period, persistent grad- ual increases in currency and other non- reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. o When the Committee judges that reserve bal- ances have declined to this level, the SOMA portfolio will hold no more securities than nec- essary for efficient and effective policy imple- mentation. Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the SOMA discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period. In Page 5 Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ the United States, equity indexes moved higher and credit spreads tightened. Market participants attributed these moves largely to a perceived shift in the FOMC’s approach to policy following communications stressing that the Committee would be patient in assessing the need for future adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate and would be flexible on balance sheet policy. In Europe, measures announced by the European Cen- tral Bank (ECB) in March, including an extension of for- ward guidance on interest rates and the announcement of another round of targeted long-term refinancing op- erations, were followed by a decline in euro-area equity markets, particularly bank stocks, as well as declines in euro-area rates. Market contacts attributed the price re- action to a perception that the measures were not as stimulative as might have been expected, given down- ward revisions in the ECB’s growth and inflation fore- casts. In China, authorities moved toward an easier fis- cal and monetary stance; China’s aggregate credit growth had rebounded slightly in recent months relative to the declining trend observed last year. The Shanghai Com- posite index had risen notably since the turn of the year, driven in part by fiscal and monetary stimulus measures as well as perceived progress on trade negotiations. De- velopments around Brexit remained a source of market uncertainty. Consistent with ongoing investor uncer- tainty over the outcome, risk reversals on the pound– dollar currency pair continued to point to higher de- mand for protection against pound depreciation relative to the dollar. The deputy manager provided an overview of money market developments and policy implementation over the intermeeting period. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) continued to be very stable at a level equal to the interest rate on excess reserves. Rates in overnight se- cured markets continued to exhibit some volatility, par- ticularly on month-end dates. Market participants at- tributed some of the volatility in overnight secured rates to persistently high net dealer inventories of Treasury se- curities and to Treasury issuance coinciding with the month-end statement dates. Over the upcoming inter- meeting period, with the combination of changes in the Treasury’s balances at the Federal Reserve and additional asset redemptions, reserves were expected to decline to a new low of around $1.4 trillion by early May, with some notable fluctuations in reserves on days associated with tax flows. The deputy manager also discussed the transition to a long-run regime of ample reserves, following the Com- mittee’s January announcement that it intends to con- tinue to implement monetary policy in such a regime. Once the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet has normalized, the Open Market Desk will at some point need to conduct open market operations to maintain a level of reserves in the banking system that the Commit- tee deems appropriate. In doing so, the Desk will need to assess banks’ demand for reserves as well as forecast other Federal Reserve liabilities and plan operations to maintain a supply of reserves sufficient to ensure that control over short-term interest rates is exercised pri- marily through the setting of administered rates. The deputy manager described a possible operational ap- proach in an ample-reserves regime based on establish- ing a minimum operating level that would be a lower bound on the daily level of reserves. The assessment of the minimum operating level of reserves would be based on a range of information, including surveys of banks and market participants, data on banks’ reserve holdings, and market monitoring. Under the proposed approach, the Desk would plan open market operations to main- tain the daily level of reserves above the minimum oper- ating level. Consistent with the Committee’s intention to maintain a regime that does not require active man- agement of the supply of reserves, the Desk could plan these open market operations over a medium-term hori- zon. The average level of reserves over the medium term would then be above the minimum operating level, providing a buffer of reserves to absorb daily changes in nonreserve liabilities. Following the manager and deputy manager’s report, some participants commented on various aspects of the minimum operating level approach. Decisions regarding how far to allow reserves to decline would need to bal- ance important tradeoffs. On the one hand, a lower minimum operating level might increase the risk of ex- cessive interest rate volatility. On the other hand, a lower minimum operating level could provide more op- portunities to learn about underlying reserve demand or could be viewed as more consistent with moving to the smallest securities holdings necessary for efficient and effective monetary policy implementation. However, the scope for reducing the level of reserves much further after the end of balance sheet runoff might be fairly lim- ited. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the March 19–20 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong, although growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have slowed markedly in the first quarter of this year from its solid fourth-quarter pace. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), was somewhat below 2 percent in De- cember, held down in part by recent declines in con- sumer energy prices, while PCE price inflation for items other than food and energy was close to 2 percent; more recent readings on PCE price inflation were delayed by the earlier federal government shutdown. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Increases in total nonfarm payroll employment re- mained solid, on average, in recent months; employment rose only a little in February but had expanded strongly in January. The national unemployment rate edged down, on net, over the past two months to 3.8 percent in February, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly on balance. The unemployment rates for African Ameri- cans, Asians, and Hispanics in February were at or below their levels at the end of the previous economic expan- sion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained. The share of workers em- ployed part time for economic reasons moved down in February and was below the lows reached in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings in January was the same as its fourth-quarter average and remained ele- vated, while the rate of quits edged up in January; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unem- ployment insurance benefits through early March was still near historically low levels. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.4 percent over the 12 months ending in February, a significantly faster pace than a year earlier. The employment cost index for private-sector workers increased 3 percent over the 12 months ending in December, somewhat faster than a year earlier. Total labor compensation per hour in the business sector in- creased 2.9 percent over the four quarters of 2018, about the same rate as a year earlier. Industrial production declined in January and rebounded only somewhat in February. Moreover, manufacturing output decreased over both months, as production in the motor vehicle and parts sector contracted notably in January and declines were more broad based in Febru- ary. Production in the mining and utilities sectors ex- panded, on net, over the past two months. Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would be roughly flat in the near term, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to only modest gains in overall factory output in the coming months. Household spending looked to be slowing around the turn of the year. Real PCE decreased markedly in De- cember after a solid increase in the previous month, and the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate PCE rebounded only partially in January. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low un- employment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensa- tion, and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term. In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, stepped up in February and early March to an upbeat level. Real residential investment appeared to be softening fur- ther in the first quarter, likely reflecting, in part, de- creases in the affordability of housing arising from both the net increase in mortgage interest rates over the past year and ongoing house price appreciation. Starts of new single-family homes increased slightly, on net, over December and January, while starts of multifamily units declined. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the un- derlying trend in construction of such homes—moved down over those two months. In addition, sales of both new and existing homes decreased in January. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property looked to be slowing in the first quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense cap- ital goods excluding aircraft rose in December and Jan- uary, while available indicators pointed to a decrease in transportation equipment spending in the first quarter after a strong fourth-quarter gain. Forward-looking in- dicators of business equipment spending—such as or- ders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and readings on business sentiment—pointed to sluggish in- creases in the near term. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector increased in December and January. In addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in Page 7 Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ operation—an indicator of business spending for struc- tures in the drilling and mining sector—expanded, on balance, in February and through the middle of March. a modest pickup in China. Inflation in foreign econo- mies slowed further early this year, partly reflecting lower retail energy prices across both AFEs and EMEs. Total real government purchases appeared to be moving sideways in the first quarter. Relatively strong increases in real federal defense purchases were likely to be roughly offset by an expected decline in real nondefense purchases stemming from the effects of the partial fed- eral government shutdown. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to be rising modestly in the first quarter, as the payrolls of those governments ex- panded a bit in January and February, and nominal state and local construction spending rose, on net, in Decem- ber and January. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in November before widening in December to the largest deficit since 2008. Exports declined in November and December, as exports of industrial supplies and automo- tive products fell in both months. Imports decreased in November before partially recovering in December, with imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies driving this swing. The BEA estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of about ¼ percentage point on the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, slightly slower than a year earlier, as consumer energy prices declined a little and consumer food prices rose only modestly. Core PCE price infla- tion, which excludes changes in consumer food and en- ergy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period, some- what higher than a year earlier. The consumer price in- dex (CPI) rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in February, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent. Re- cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Michi- gan survey, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Economic growth in foreign economies slowed further in the fourth quarter. This development reflected slow- ing in the Canadian economy and some emerging market economies (EMEs), including Brazil and Mexico, along with continued economic weakness in the euro area and China. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), re- cent data suggested that economic activity, especially in the manufacturing sector, remained subdued in the first quarter of this year. Economic activity also remained weak in many EMEs, particularly in Mexico and emerg- ing Asia excluding China, although some data pointed to Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment toward risky assets continued to im- prove over the intermeeting period. Market participants cited accommodative monetary policy communications and optimism for a trade deal between the United States and China as factors that contributed to the improve- ment. Broad equity price indexes increased notably, cor- porate bond spreads narrowed, and measures of equity market volatility declined. Meanwhile, financing condi- tions for businesses and households improved slightly and generally remained supportive of economic activity. FOMC communications issued following the January meeting were generally viewed by market participants as more accommodative than expected. Subsequent com- munications—including the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, the Chair’s semiannual testimony to the Congress, and speeches by FOMC participants—were interpreted as reflecting a patient approach to monetary policy in the near term and a likely conclusion to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet reduction by the end of this year. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2019 declined slightly over the period, while in- vestors continued to expect no change to the target range for the federal funds rate at the March FOMC meeting. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate for 2020 and 2021 shifted down a little. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined a bit across the Treasury yield curve over the intermeeting pe- riod. Communications from FOMC participants that were more accommodative than expected amid muted readings on inflation, communications from other major central banks that, on balance, were also regarded as more accommodative than expected, and generally mixed economic data releases reportedly contributed to the decrease in yields and outweighed improved risk sen- timent. The spread between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed over the period and remained in the lower end of its historical range of recent decades. Measures of inflation compen- sation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Secu- rities increased modestly, on net, although they remained below levels seen last fall. Major U.S. equity price indexes increased over the inter- meeting period, with broad-based gains across sectors. Improved prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China and accommodative monetary policy were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker- Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ than-expected announcements of corporate earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 2019. Consistent with reports about a potential trade deal, stock prices of firms with greater exposure to China generally outperformed the S&P 500 index. Option- implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one- month horizon—the VIX—declined and reached its lowest point this year. Spreads on investment- and spec- ulative-grade corporate bonds narrowed, consistent with the gains in equity prices, but were still wider than levels observed last fall. Conditions in short-term funding markets generally re- mained stable over the intermeeting period. The EFFR was consistently equal to the rate of interest on excess reserves, while take-up in the overnight reverse repur- chase agreement facility remained low. Yield spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit generally narrowed further from their elevated year-end levels, likely reflecting an increase in investor demand for short-term financial assets. Meanwhile, the statutory federal government debt ceiling was reestablished at $22 trillion on March 1. The prices of foreign risky assets broadly tracked the positive moves in similar U.S. assets over the intermeet- ing period. Communications by major central banks, which were, on net, more accommodative than ex- pected, along with optimism regarding trade negotia- tions between the United States and China, contributed to the upward price moves and more than offset the ef- fects of continued concerns about foreign economic growth. In particular, global equity prices generally ended the period higher, and dedicated emerging market funds continued to see inflows. At the same time, long- term AFE yields declined somewhat, on net, on commu- nications from major foreign central banks and inves- tors’ concerns about foreign economic growth. The broad dollar index appreciated slightly as the exten- sion of accommodative policies and revised guidance by major foreign central banks weighed on AFE currencies. An exception was the British pound, which strengthened a bit against the dollar, as market participants viewed re- cent Parliamentary votes as reducing the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses contin- ued to be accommodative overall. Gross issuance of both investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds was strong in January and February, recovering from the low levels observed late last year. Issuance in the insti- tutional syndicated leveraged loan market also recovered in the first two months of the year, as new issuance in February was in line with average monthly new issuance in 2018, and spreads narrowed somewhat from their De- cember levels. The credit quality of nonfinancial corpo- rations continued to show signs of deterioration, al- though actual defaults remained low overall. Commer- cial and industrial lending showed continued strength in January and February. Small business credit market con- ditions were little changed, and credit conditions in mu- nicipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net. Private-sector analysts revised down their projections for 2019 and year-ahead corporate earnings a bit. The pace of gross equity issuance was sluggish in January but ticked up in February, consistent with the uptick in the stock market. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions continued to be generally accommodative. Commercial mortgage-backed (CMBS) spreads declined over the intermeeting period, with triple-B spreads moving down to near their late- November levels. Issuance of non-agency CMBS re- mained strong through February, and CRE lending by banks grew at a strong pace in February following rela- tively sluggish growth in January. securities Residential mortgage financing conditions remained ac- commodative on balance. Purchase mortgage origina- tion activity was flat in December but edged up in Janu- ary, as mortgage rates remained lower than the peak reached last November. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of household spending. Credit card loan growth remained strong through December, though the pace slowed during 2018 amid tighter lending standards by commercial banks. Auto loan growth remained steady through the end of 2018. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was revised down a little on balance. This revision reflected the effects of weaker- than-expected incoming data on both aggregate domes- tic spending and foreign economic growth that were only partially offset by a somewhat higher projected path for domestic equity prices and a lower projected trajec- tory for interest rates. The staff forecast that U.S. real GDP growth would slow markedly in the first quarter, reflecting a softening in growth of both consumer spending and business investment. But the staff judged that the first-quarter slowdown would be transitory and that real GDP growth would bounce back solidly in the Page 9 Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ second quarter. In the medium-term projection, real GDP growth was forecast to run at a rate similar to the staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020—a somewhat lower trajectory, on net, for real GDP than in the previous projection—and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021. The staff revised up slightly its assumed underlying trend in the labor force participation rate, raising the level of poten- tial output a bit, which contributed—along with the lower projected path for real GDP—to an assessment that resource utilization was a little less tight than in the previous forecast. The unemployment rate was pro- jected to decline a little further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out by the end of this year and begin to edge up in 2021. With labor market conditions judged to still be tight, the staff con- tinued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pres- sure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly for the March FOMC meeting, reflecting some recent softer-than-expected readings on consumer prices. Core PCE price inflation was expected to remain at 1.9 percent over this year as a whole and then to edge up to 2 percent for the remainder of the medium term. Total PCE price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation over the next three years, reflecting pro- jected declines in energy prices. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. On the upside, household spending and busi- ness investment could expand faster than the staff pro- jected, supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017, still strong overall labor market conditions, and upbeat consumer sentiment. In addition, financial con- ditions might not tighten as much as assumed in the staff forecast. On the downside, the recent softening in a number of economic indicators could be the harbinger of a substantial deterioration in economic activity. Moreover, trade policies and foreign economic develop- ments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The up- side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that is still projected to be operating no- tably above potential for an extended period was coun- terbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term infla- tion expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deterio- rated. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants agreed that information received since the January meeting indicated that the labor market had re- mained strong but that growth of economic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Recent indi- cators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. On bal- ance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit- tle changed. Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes over the next few years. Underlying economic fundamentals continued to support sustained expansion, and most participants in- dicated that they did not expect the recent weakness in spending to persist beyond the first quarter. Neverthe- less, participants generally expected the growth rate of real GDP this year to step down from the pace seen over 2018 to a rate at or modestly above their estimates of longer-run growth. Participants cited various factors as Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ likely to contribute to the step-down, including slower foreign growth and waning effects of fiscal stimulus. A number of participants judged that economic growth in the remaining quarters of 2019 and in the subsequent couple of years would likely be a little lower, on balance, than they had previously forecast. Reasons cited for these downward revisions included disappointing news on global growth and less of a boost from fiscal policy than had previously been anticipated. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that softness in consumer spending had contrib- uted importantly to the projected slowing in economic growth in the current quarter. Many participants pointed to the weakness in retail sales in December as notable, although they recognized that the data for Jan- uary had shown a partial recovery in retail sales. Partici- pants also observed that much of the recent softness likely reflected temporary factors, such as the partial fed- eral government shutdown and December’s volatility in financial markets, and that consumer sentiment had re- covered after these factors had receded. Consequently, many participants expected consumer spending to pro- ceed at a stronger pace in coming months, supported by favorable underlying factors, including a strong labor market, solid growth in household incomes, improve- ments in financial conditions and in households’ balance sheet positions, and upbeat consumer sentiment. Par- ticipants noted, however, that the continued softness in the housing sector was a concern. Participants also commented on the apparent slowing of growth in business fixed investment in the first quarter. Factors cited as consistent with the recent softness in in- vestment growth included downward revisions in fore- casts of corporate earnings; relatively low energy prices that provided less incentive for new drilling and explo- ration; flattening capital goods orders; reports from con- tacts of softer export sales and of weaker economic ac- tivity abroad; elevated levels of uncertainty about gov- ernment policies, including trade policies; and the likely effect of recent financial market volatility on business sentiment. However, many participants pointed to signs that the weakness in investment would likely abate. Some contacts in manufacturing and other sectors re- ported that business conditions were favorable, with strong demand for labor, business sentiment had recov- ered from its recent decline, and recent reductions in mortgage interest rates would provide some support for construction activity. Agricultural activity remained weak in various areas of the country, with the weakness in part reflecting adverse effects of trade policy on com- modity prices. Recent widespread severe flooding had also adversely affected the agricultural sector. Participants noted that the latest readings on overall in- flation had been somewhat softer than expected. How- ever, participants observed that these readings largely re- flected the effects of earlier declines in crude oil prices and that core inflation remained near 2 percent. Most participants, while seeing inflation pressures as muted, expected the overall rate of inflation to firm somewhat and to be at or near the Committee’s longer-run objec- tive of 2 percent over the next few years. Many partici- pants indicated that, while inflation had been close to 2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that it had not shown greater signs of firming in response to strong la- bor market conditions and rising nominal wage growth, as well as to the short-term upward pressure on prices arising from tariff increases. Low rates of price increases in sectors of the economy that were not cyclically sensi- tive were cited by a couple of participants as one reason for the recent easing in inflation. A few participants ob- served that the pickup in productivity growth last year was a welcome development helping to bolster potential output and damp inflationary pressures. In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta- tions, participants noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation had risen modestly over the in- termeeting period, although they remained low. A cou- ple of participants stressed that recent readings on sur- vey measures of inflation expectations were also still at low levels. Several participants suggested that longer- term inflation expectations could be at levels somewhat below those consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and that this might make it more dif- ficult to achieve that objective on a sustained basis. In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate, a further increase in the labor force participation rate, a low number of layoffs, near-record levels of job openings and help-wanted postings, and solid job gains, on average, in recent months. Participants observed that, following strong job gains in January, there had been little growth in pay- rolls in February, although a few participants pointed out that the February reading had likely been affected by ad- verse weather conditions. A couple of participants noted that, over the medium term, some easing in pay- roll growth was to be expected as economic growth slowed to its longer-run trend rate. Reports from busi- ness contacts predominantly pointed to continued Page 11 Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ strong labor demand, with firms offering both higher wages and more nonwage benefits to attract workers. Economy-wide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with recent rates of labor productivity growth and with inflation of 2 percent. A few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures and ex- panding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market. Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity. A few partici- pants noted that there remained a high level of uncer- tainty associated with international developments, in- cluding ongoing trade talks and Brexit deliberations, al- though a couple of participants remarked that the risks of adverse outcomes were somewhat lower than in Jan- uary. Other downside risks included the possibility of sizable spillovers from a greater-than-expected eco- nomic slowdown in Europe and China, persistence of the softness in spending, or a sharp falloff in fiscal stim- ulus. A few participants observed that an economic de- terioration in the United States, if it occurred, might be amplified by significant debt service burdens for many firms. Participants also mentioned a number of upside risks regarding the outlook for economic activity, includ- ing outcomes in which various sources of uncertainty were resolved favorably, consumer and business senti- ment rebounded sharply, or the recent strengthening in labor productivity growth signaled a pickup in the un- derlying trend. Upside risks to the outlook for inflation included the possibility that wage pressures could rise unexpectedly and lead to greater-than-expected price in- creases. In their discussion of financial developments, partici- pants observed that a good deal of the tightening over the latter part of last year in financial conditions had since been reversed; Federal Reserve communications since the beginning of this year were seen as an im- portant contributor to the recent improvements in fi- nancial conditions. Participants noted that asset valua- tions had recovered strongly and also discussed the de- cline that had occurred in recent months in yields on longer-term Treasury securities. Several participants ex- pressed concern that the yield curve for Treasury securi- ties was now quite flat and noted that historical evidence suggested that an inverted yield curve could portend economic weakness; however, their discussion also noted that the unusually low level of term premiums in longer-term interest rates made historical relationships a less reliable basis for assessing the implications of the recent behavior of the yield curve. Several participants pointed to the increased debt issuance and higher lever- age of nonfinancial corporations as a development that warranted continued monitoring. In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at the current meeting, participants agreed that it would be ap- propriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. Participants judged that the labor market remained strong, but that information received over the intermeeting period, in- cluding recent readings on household spending and business fixed investment, pointed to slower economic growth in the early part of this year than in the fourth quarter of 2018. Despite these indications of softer first- quarter growth, participants generally expected eco- nomic activity to continue to expand, labor markets to remain strong, and inflation to remain near 2 percent. Participants also noted significant uncertainties sur- rounding their economic outlooks, including those re- lated to global economic and financial developments. In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate. Several participants observed that the characterization of the Committee’s approach to monetary policy as “patient” would need to be reviewed regularly as the economic outlook and uncertainties sur- rounding the outlook evolve. A couple of participants noted that the “patient” characterization should not be seen as limiting the Committee’s options for making pol- icy adjustments when they are deemed appropriate. With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a majority of participants expected that the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out- look would likely warrant leaving the target range un- changed for the remainder of the year. Several of these participants noted that the current target range for the federal funds rate was close to their estimates of its longer-run neutral level and foresaw economic growth continuing near its longer-run trend rate over the fore- cast period. Participants continued to emphasize that their decisions about the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate at coming meetings would depend on their ongoing assessments of the economic outlook, as informed by a wide range of data, as well as on how the risks to the outlook evolved. Several participants noted that their views of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate could shift in either direction based on incoming data and other developments. Some partici- pants indicated that if the economy evolved as they cur- rently expected, with economic growth above its longer- Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ run trend rate, they would likely judge it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate modestly later this year. Several participants expressed concerns that the public had, at times, misinterpreted the medians of participants’ assessments of the appropriate level for the federal funds rate presented in the SEP as representing the con- sensus view of the Committee or as suggesting that pol- icy was on a preset course. Such misinterpretations could complicate the Committee’s communications re- garding its view of appropriate monetary policy, particu- larly in circumstances when the future course of policy is unusually uncertain. Nonetheless, several participants noted that the policy rate projections in the SEP are a valuable component of the overall information provided about the monetary policy outlook. The Chair noted that he had asked the subcommittee on communications to consider ways to improve the information contained in the SEP and to improve communications regarding the role of the federal funds rate projections in the SEP as part of the policy process. Participants also discussed alternative interpretations of subdued inflation pressures in current economic circum- stances and the associated policy implications. Several participants observed that limited inflationary pressures during a period of historically low unemployment could be a sign that low inflation expectations were exerting downward pressure on inflation relative to the Commit- tee’s 2 percent inflation target; in addition, subdued in- flation pressures could indicate a less tight labor market than suggested by common measures of resource utili- zation. Consistent with these observations, several par- ticipants noted that various indicators of inflation expec- tations had remained at the lower end of their historical range, and a few participants commented that they had recently revised down their estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate consistent with 2 percent inflation. In light of these considerations, some participants noted that the appropriate response of the federal funds rate to signs of labor market tightening could be modest pro- vided that signs of inflation pressures continued to be limited. Some participants regarded their judgments that the federal funds rate was likely to remain on a very flat trajectory as reflecting other factors, such as low esti- mates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate or risk- management considerations. A few participants ob- served that the appropriate path for policy, insofar as it implied lower interest rates for longer periods of time, could lead to greater financial stability risks. However, a couple of these participants noted that such financial sta- bility risks could be addressed through appropriate use of countercyclical macroprudential policy tools or other supervisory or regulatory tools. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market remained strong but that growth of eco- nomic activity had slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had re- mained low. Recent indicators pointed to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term in- flations expectations were little changed. In their consideration of the economic outlook, mem- bers noted that financial conditions had improved since the beginning of year, but that some time would be needed to assess whether indications of weak economic growth in the first quarter would persist in subsequent quarters. Members also noted that inflationary pressures remained muted and that a number of uncertainties bearing on the U.S. and global economic outlook still awaited resolution. However, members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Commit- tee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. economy in the period ahead. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, members concurred that the Committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com- mittee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum- employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objec- tives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including Page 13 Minutes of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla- tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. More gen- erally, members noted that decisions regarding near- term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to characterize the labor market as remaining strong. While payroll employment had been little changed in February, job gains had been solid, on aver- age, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members also agreed to note that growth in economic activity appeared to have slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter, consistent with recent indicators of household spending and business fixed in- vestment. The description of overall inflation was re- vised to recognize that inflation had declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices, while still noting that in- flation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 21, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage- backed securities the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are ac- ceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter. Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed invest- ment in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 2.40 percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex- isting level of 3.00 percent, effective March 21, 2019. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 30– May 1, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on March 20, 2019. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on February 19, 2019, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 29–30, 2019. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 1 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 19–20, 2019, meet- ing participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ- ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af- fect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab- sence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out- comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat- isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. Participants who submitted longer-run projections gen- erally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate. Most participants continued to expect real GDP growth to edge down over the projection horizon, with almost all participants projecting growth in 2021 to be at or be- low their estimates of its longer-run rate. All participants who submitted longer-run projections continued to ex- pect that the unemployment rate would run at or below their estimates of its longer-run level through 2021. Al- most all participants projected that inflation, as meas- ured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase slightly over the next two years, and most participants expected that it would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021. Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from December 2018, all participants marked down somewhat their projections for real GDP growth in 2019, and most revised down slightly their projections for total inflation in 2019. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. As shown in figure 2, most participants expected that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through the end of 2019. The medians of partici- pants’ assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate in 2020 and 2021 were close to the median assessment of its longer-run level. Compared with the December submissions, the median projections for the federal funds rate for the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 were 50 basis points lower. A substantial majority of participants continued to view the uncertainty around their projections as broadly sim- ilar to the average of the past 20 years. While a majority of participants viewed the risks to the outlook as bal- anced, a couple more participants than in December viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside. The Outlook for Economic Activity As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projec- tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi- tional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.1 percent. Most participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with the median projection at 1.9 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021, a touch lower than the median estimate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent. Relative to the December SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 were 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point lower, respectively. Most participants mentioned a re- cent patch of weaker data on domestic economic activ- ity, and some pointed to a softer global growth outlook, as factors behind the downward revisions to their near- term growth estimates. The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, about ½ per- centage point below the median assessment of its longer- run level. The median projections for 2020 and 2021 were 3.8 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. These median unemployment rates were a little higher than those from the December SEP. Nevertheless, most par- ticipants continued to project that the unemployment rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longer- run level.

Page 5 Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ unemployment was 4.3 percent, which was slightly lower than in December. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run. The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 shifted down relative to that in the De- cember SEP, while the distributions for 2020, 2021, and the longer-run rate of GDP growth changed only slightly. The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved mod- estly higher relative to those in December, and the dis- tribution in 2021 edged higher as well. Meanwhile, the distribution for the longer-run unemployment rate shifted down a touch. The Outlook for Inflation As shown in table 1, the medians of projections for total PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent in 2019 and 2.0 percent in both 2020 and 2021, each a touch lower than in the December SEP. The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation over the 2019–21 period were 2.0 percent, the same as in December. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri- butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in- flation. The distributions of projections for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 shifted down slightly from the Decem- ber SEP. Almost all participants expected that total and core PCE price inflation would be between 1.8 and 2.2 percent throughout the projection horizon. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg- ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run. The distributions for 2019 through 2021 shifted toward lower values. Compared with the projections prepared for the December SEP, the median federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower each year over the 2019–21 period. At the end of 2019, the median of federal funds rate projections was 2.38 percent, consistent with no rate increases over the course of 2019. Thereafter, the medi- ans of the projections were 2.63 percent at the end of both 2020 and 2021, slightly lower than the median of the longer-run projections of the federal funds rate of 2.75 percent. Muted inflationary pressures and risk- management considerations were both cited as factors contributing to the downward revisions in participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for the policy rate. The distribution of individual projections for the longer- run federal funds rate ticked down from December. Table 2.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His- torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx. doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020. 1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur. As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts display the SEP medians for the three variables sur- rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the de- gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncer- tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore- cast horizon lengthens. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C.

Page 11 Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of March 19–20, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ view the degree of uncertainty attached to their eco- nomic projections for real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.2 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. A majority of participants judged the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth, the unem- ployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart. The balance of risks to the projection for real GDP growth shifted a bit lower, with four participants assessing the risks as weighted to the downside and no participant seeing it weighted to the upside. The balance of risks to the projection for the unemployment rate moved a touch higher, with three participants judging the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside and two participants viewing the risks as weighted to the downside. In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation projections shifted down slightly relative to December. Two more participants than in December saw the risks to the inflation projec- tions as weighted to the downside, and no participant judged the risks as weighted to the upside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, trade tensions as well as develop- ments abroad were mentioned by participants as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the economic growth outlook. For the inflation outlook, the effect of trade restrictions was cited as an upside risk, while the concern that inflation expectations could be drifting below the FOMC’s objective and the potential for a stronger dollar and weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as downside risks. A number of participants mentioned that their assessments of risks remained roughly balanced in part as a result of their downward revisions to the appropriate federal funds rate path. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel- opments over time in key economic variables such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed- eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables along with other factors. Figure 5 provides a graphical representa- tion of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons. 2 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Page 16 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year and 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the second and third years. The corre- sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla- tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confi- dence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen- tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. How- ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate can- not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down- side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.

Balance Sheet Normalization Participants resumed their discussion of issues related to balance sheet normalization with a focus on the long- run maturity composition of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio. The staff presented two il- lustrative scenarios as a way of highlighting a range of implications of different long-run target portfolio com- positions. In the first scenario, the maturity composition of the U.S. Treasury securities in the target portfolio was similar to that of the universe of currently outstanding U.S. Treasury securities (a “proportional” portfolio). In the second, the target portfolio contained only shorter- term securities with maturities of three years or less (a “shorter maturity” portfolio). The staff provided esti- mates of the capacity that the Committee would have under each scenario to provide economic stimulus through a maturity extension program (MEP). The staff Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ also provided estimates of the extent to which term pre- miums embedded in longer-term Treasury yields might be affected under the two different scenarios. Based on the staff’s standard modeling framework, all else equal, a move to the illustrative shorter maturity portfolio would put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macro- economic outcomes as in the baseline outlook. How- ever, the staff noted the uncertainties inherent in the analysis, including the difficulties in estimating the ef- fects of changes in SOMA holdings on longer-term in- terest rates and the economy more generally. The staff presentation also considered illustrative grad- ual and accelerated transition paths to each long-run tar- get portfolio. Under the illustrative “gradual” transition, reinvestments of maturing Treasury holdings, principal payments on agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and purchases to accommodate growth in Federal Re- serve liabilities would be directed to Treasury securities with maturities in the long-run target portfolio. Under the illustrative “accelerated” transition, the reinvestment of principal payments on agency MBS and purchases to accommodate growth in Federal Reserve liabilities would be directed to Treasury bills until the weighted average maturity (WAM) of the SOMA portfolio reached the WAM associated with the target portfolio. Depending on the combination of long-run target com- position and the transition plan for arriving at that com- position, the staff reported that, in the illustrative sce- narios, it could take from 5 years to more than 15 years for the WAM of the SOMA portfolio to reach its long- run level. In its Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implemen- tation and Balance Sheet Normalization, the Committee noted that it is prepared to adjust the size and composi- tion of the balance sheet to achieve its macroeconomic objectives in a scenario in which the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound. Against this backdrop, participants discussed the benefits and costs of alternative long-run target portfolio compositions in supporting the use of balance sheet policies in such sce- narios. In their discussion of a shorter maturity portfolio, many participants noted the advantage of increased capacity for the Federal Reserve to conduct an MEP, which could be helpful in providing policy accommodation in a fu- ture economic downturn given the secular decline in neutral real interest rates and the associated reduced scope for lowering the federal funds rate in response to negative economic shocks. Several participants viewed an MEP as a useful initial option to address a future downturn in which the Committee judged that it needed to employ balance sheet actions to provide appropriate policy accommodation. Participants acknowledged the staff analysis suggesting that creating space to conduct an MEP by moving to a shorter maturity portfolio com- position could boost term premiums and result in a lower path for the federal funds rate, reducing the capac- ity to ease financial conditions with adjustments in short- term rates. A number of participants noted, however, that the estimates of the effect of a move to a shorter- maturity portfolio composition on the long-run neutral federal funds rate are subject to substantial uncertainty and are based on a number of strong modeling assump- tions. For example, estimates of term premium effects based on experience during the crisis could overstate the effects that would be associated with a gradual evolution of the composition of the SOMA portfolio. In addition, a shift in the composition of the SOMA portfolio could result in changes in the supply of securities that would tend to offset upward pressure on term premiums. Nonetheless, other participants expressed concern about the potential that a shorter maturity portfolio composition could result in a lower long-run neutral fed- eral funds rate. Moreover, while a shorter maturity port- folio would provide substantial capacity to conduct an MEP, some participants raised questions about the ef- fectiveness of MEPs as a policy tool relative to that of the federal funds rate or other unconventional policy tools. These participants noted that, in a situation in which it would be appropriate to employ unconven- tional policy tools, they likely would prefer to employ forward guidance or large-scale purchases of assets ahead of an MEP. In the view of these participants, the potential benefit of transitioning to a shorter maturity SOMA composition in terms of increased ability to con- duct an MEP might not be worth the potential costs. In their discussion of a proportional portfolio composi- tion, participants observed that moving to this target SOMA composition would not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in re- sponse to adverse economic shocks. As a result, several participants judged the proportional target composition to be well aligned with the Committee’s previous state- ments that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the Commit- tee adjusts the stance of monetary policy. In addition, several participants noted that while the staff analysis _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2019Page 3 suggested a proportional portfolio would not contain as much capacity to conduct an MEP as a shorter maturity portfolio, it still would contain meaningful capacity along these lines. Some participants noted that a pro- portional portfolio would also help maintain the tradi- tional separation between the Federal Reserve’s deci- sions regarding the composition of the SOMA portfolio and the maturity composition of Treasury debt held by the private sector. However, a number of participants judged that it would be desirable to structure the SOMA portfolio in a way that would provide more capacity to conduct an MEP than in the proportional portfolio. In addition, a couple of participants noted that a shorter maturity portfolio would maintain a narrow gap between the average maturity of the assets in the SOMA portfolio and the short average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s primary liabilities. Participants also discussed the financial stability implica- tions that could be associated with alternative long-run target portfolio compositions. A couple of participants noted that a proportional portfolio could imply a rela- tively flat yield curve, which could result in greater in- centives for “reach for yield” behavior in the financial system. That said, a few participants noted that a shorter maturity portfolio could affect financial stability risks by increasing the incentives for the private sector to issue short-term debt. A couple of participants judged that financial market functioning might be adversely affected if the holdings in the shorter maturity portfolio ac- counted for too large a share of total shorter maturity Treasury securities outstanding. In discussing the transition to the desired long-run SOMA portfolio composition, several participants noted that a gradual pace of transition could help avoid un- wanted effects on financial conditions. However, par- ticipants observed that the gradual transition paths de- scribed in the staff presentation would take many years to complete. Against this backdrop, a few participants discussed the possibility of following some type of ac- celerated transition, perhaps including sales of the SOMA’s residual holdings of agency MBS. In addition, several participants suggested that the Committee could communicate its plans about the SOMA portfolio com- position in terms of a desired change over an intermedi- ate horizon rather than a specific long-run target. Several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the long-run composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time, and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications practices. Some participants noted the importance of developing an effective communica- tion plan to describe the Committee’s decisions regard- ing the long-run target composition for the SOMA port- folio and the transition to that target composition. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager of the SOMA reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. In the United States, prices for equities and other risk assets re- portedly were buoyed by perceptions of an accommoda- tive stance of monetary policy, incoming economic data pointing to continued solid economic expansion, and some signs of receding downside risks to the global out- look. Treasury yields declined over the period, adding to their substantial drop since September, and the expected path of the federal funds rate as implied by futures prices shifted down as well. Market participants attributed these moves in part to FOMC communications indicat- ing that the Committee would continue to be patient in evaluating the need for any further adjustments of the target range for the federal funds rate. Softer incoming data on inflation may also have contributed to the down- ward revision in the expected path of policy. Nearly all respondents on the Open Market Desk’s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants anticipated that the federal funds target range would be unchanged for the remainder of the year. In reviewing global devel- opments, the manager noted that market prices appeared to reflect perceptions of improved economic prospects in China. However, investors reportedly remained con- cerned about the economic outlook for Europe and the United Kingdom. The manager also reported on developments related to open market operations. In light of the declines in inter- est rates since November last year, principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency MBS were projected to exceed the $20 billion redemption cap by a modest amount sometime this summer. As directed by the Committee, any principal payments received on agency MBS in excess of the cap would be reinvested in agency MBS. The Desk planned to conduct any such operations by purchasing uniform MBS rather than Fan- nie Mae and Freddie Mac securities. Consistent with the Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans re- leased following the March meeting, reinvestments of maturing Treasury securities beginning on May 2 would be based on a cap on monthly Treasury redemptions of Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ $15 billion—down from the $30 billion monthly re- demption cap that had been in place since October of last year. The deputy manager reviewed developments in domes- tic money markets. Reserve balances declined by $150 billion over the intermeeting period and reached a low point of just below $1.5 trillion on April 23. The decline in reserves stemmed from a reduction in the SOMA’s agency MBS and Treasury holdings of $46 bil- lion, reducing the SOMA portfolio to $3.92 trillion, and from a shift in the composition of liabilities, predomi- nantly related to the increase in the Treasury General Ac- count (TGA). The TGA was volatile during the intermeeting period. In early April, the Treasury reduced bill issuance and al- lowed the TGA balance to fall in anticipation of individ- ual tax receipts. As tax receipts arrived after the tax date, the TGA rose to more than $400 billion, resulting in a sharp decline in reserves over the last two weeks of April. Against this backdrop, the distribution of rates on traded volumes in overnight unsecured markets shifted higher. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) moved up to 2.45 percent by the end of the intermeeting period, 5 ba- sis points above the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. Several factors appeared to spur this upward pressure. Tax-related runoffs in deposits at banks reportedly led banks to increase short-term borrowing, particularly through Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and in the federal funds market. Although some banks continued to hold large quantities of reserves, other banks were operating with reserve balances closer to their lowest comfortable levels as reported in the most recent Senior Financial Officer Survey. This distribution of reserves may have contributed to somewhat more sus- tained upward pressure on the federal funds rate than had been experienced in recent years around tax-pay- ment dates. In addition, rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo), were, in part, pushed higher by tax- related outflows from government-only money market mutual funds and a corresponding decline in repo lend- ing by those funds. Elevated repo rates contributed to upward pressure on the federal funds rate, as FHLBs re- portedly shifted some of their liquidity investments out of federal funds and into the repo market. In addition, some market participants pointed to heightened demand for federal funds at month end by some banks in con- nection with their efforts to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements as contributing to upward pressure on the federal funds rate. The deputy manager also discussed a staff proposal in which the Board would implement a 5 basis point tech- nical adjustment to the Interest on Required Reserves (IORR) and IOER rates. The proposed action would bring these rates to 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate and 10 basis points above the bottom of the range and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offer rate. As with the previous technical adjustments in June and December 2018, the proposed adjustment was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market well within the target range established by the FOMC. A technical adjustment would reduce the spread between the IOER rate and the ON RRP offering rate to 10 basis points, the smallest since the introduction of the ON RRP facility. The staff judged that the narrower spread did not pose a significant risk of increased take-up at the ON RRP facility because repo rates had been trading well above the ON RRP offer rate for some time. How- ever, if it became appropriate in the future to further lower the IOER rate, the staff noted that the Committee might wish to first consider where to set the ON RRP offer rate relative to the target range for the federal funds rate to mitigate this risk. The manager concluded the briefing on financial market developments and open market operations with a review of the role of standing swap lines in supporting financial stability. He recommended that the Committee vote to renew these swap lines at this meeting following the usual annual schedule. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2019Page 5 Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the April 30–May 1 meet- ing indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) in- creased at a solid rate in the first quarter even as house- hold spending and business fixed investment rose more slowly in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), declined, on net, in recent months and was somewhat below 2 per- cent in March. Survey-based measures of longer-run in- flation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment recorded a strong gain in March, and the unemployment rate held steady at 3.8 percent. The labor force participation rate de- clined a little in March after having risen, on balance, in the previous few months, and the employment-to-pop- ulation ratio edged down. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in March were at or below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged up in March but was still below the lows reached in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings in February declined slightly from the elevated level that prevailed for much of the past year, while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the four-week mov- ing average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-April was near historically low lev- els. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in March, a somewhat faster pace than a year earlier. The employ- ment cost index for private-sector workers increased 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March, the same as a year earlier. Industrial production edged down in March and for the first quarter overall. Manufacturing output declined moderately in the first quarter, primarily reflecting a de- crease in the output of motor vehicles and parts; outside of motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing production was little changed. Mining output declined, on net, over the three months ending in March. Automakers’ assem- bly schedules suggested that the production of light mo- tor vehicles would move up in the near term, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufactur- ing surveys pointed to modest gains in overall factory output in the coming months. However, industry news indicated that aircraft production would slow in the sec- ond quarter. Consumer expenditures slowed in the first quarter, but monthly data suggested some improvement toward the end of the quarter. Real PCE increased at a robust pace in March after having been unchanged in February, per- haps partly reflecting a delay in tax refunds from Febru- ary into March that was due, in part, to the partial gov- ernment shutdown. Similarly, sales of light motor vehi- cles rose sharply in March, although the average pace of sales in the first quarter was slower than in the fourth quarter. Key factors that influence consumer spend- ing—including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation, and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of solid near-term gains in consumer expenditures. In addition, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, edged down in April but was still upbeat. The staff reported preliminary anal- ysis of the levels of and trends in average household wealth by racial and ethnic groups as measured by the Federal Reserve Board’s Distributional Financial Ac- counts initiative. Real residential investment declined at a slower rate in the first quarter than it did over the course of 2018. Af- ter an appreciable uptick in January, starts of new single- family homes fell in February and were little changed in March. Meanwhile, starts of multifamily units rose in February and stayed at that level in March. Building per- mit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in con- struction of such homes—declined a little in February and March. Sales of both new and existing homes in- creased, on net, over the February-and-March period. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property slowed in the first quarter, reflecting both a slower increase in transportation equip- ment spending after a strong fourth-quarter gain and a decline in spending on other types of equipment outside of high tech. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed, on net, in February and March, but they rose for the quarter as a whole. Forward-looking indicators of business equip- ment spending pointed to sluggish increases in the near term. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased noticeably in March but were only a little above the level of shipments, and readings on busi- ness sentiment improved a bit but were still softer than last year. Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector in- creased somewhat in the first quarter after having de- clined for several quarters. Investment in drilling and mining structures moved down in the first quarter, and Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in opera- tion—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—declined, on net, from mid-March through late April. a weak fourth quarter; GDP growth rebounded in the euro area and also appeared to pick up in Canada and the United Kingdom. Foreign inflation slowed further early this year, partly reflecting lower retail energy prices. Total real government purchases increased in the first quarter. Real purchases by the federal government were unchanged, as a relatively strong increase in defense pur- chases was offset by a decline in nondefense purchases stemming from the effects of the partial federal govern- ment shutdown. Real purchases by state and local gov- ernments increased briskly; payrolls of those govern- ments expanded solidly in the first quarter, and nominal state and local construction spending rose markedly. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed significantly in January and a touch more in February. After declining in December, the value of U.S. exports rose in January and February. However, the average dol- lar value of exports in the first two months of the year was only slightly above its fourth-quarter value. Imports fell in January before edging a touch higher in February, with the average of the two months declining relative to the fourth quarter. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth in the first quarter was about 1 percentage point. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in March. This increase was somewhat slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) slowed to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation was a bit below core inflation, and consumer energy prices were little changed. The trimmed-mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.0 percent over that 12-month pe- riod. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in March, while core CPI in- flation was 2.0 percent. Recent readings on survey- based measures of longer-run inflation expectations— including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed. Foreign economic growth in the first quarter was mixed. Among the emerging market economies (EMEs), real GDP contracted in South Korea and Mexico, but activ- ity in China strengthened, supported by tax cuts and the easing of credit conditions. In the advanced foreign economies, economic indicators were downbeat in Ja- pan but elsewhere pointed to some improvement from Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment continued to improve over the inter- meeting period. Broad equity price indexes rose notably and corporate bond spreads narrowed amid a decline in market volatility, and financing conditions for busi- nesses and households also eased. Market participants cited more accommodative than expected monetary pol- icy communications coupled with strong U.S. and Chi- nese data releases and positive sentiment about trade ne- gotiations between the United States and China as fac- tors that contributed to these developments. Communications following the March FOMC meeting were generally viewed by investors as having a more ac- commodative tone than expected. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate shifted downward mod- estly, on net, resulting in a flat to slightly downward slop- ing expected path of the policy rate over the next few FOMC meetings. Market participants assigned greater probability to a lower target range of the federal funds rate than to a higher one beyond the next few meetings. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined modestly, on net, during the intermeeting period. Investors cited larger-than-expected downward revisions in FOMC par- ticipants’ assessments of the future path of the policy rate in the Summary of Economic Projections, recent communications suggesting a patient approach to mon- etary policy, and weaker-than-expected euro-area data releases early in the period among factors that contrib- uted to this decrease. These factors reportedly out- weighed stronger-than-expected economic data releases for the United States and China and optimism related to trade negotiations between the two countries later in the period. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities were changed lit- tle, on net, and remained below their early fall 2018 lev- els. Major U.S. equity price indexes increased over the inter- meeting period, with the S&P 500 equity index returning to the levels it reached before its decline in the last quar- ter of 2018. Following the March FOMC meeting, bank stock prices declined, reportedly on concerns about the potential effects of a flat or inverted yield curve on bank profits; bank stocks subsequently retraced this decline partly in response to strong first-quarter earnings at some of the largest U.S. banks, ending the period a bit higher, on net. Option-implied volatility on the S&P _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2019Page 7 500—the VIX—decreased to a low level last seen in September 2018. Yields on corporate bonds continued to decline and spreads over yields of comparable-ma- turity Treasury securities narrowed. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble during the intermeeting period. The EFFR rose to 5 basis points above the IOER rate after the federal in- come tax deadline on April 15. While a similar dynamic occurred around previous tax dates, the magnitude of the change was larger than in previous years. Spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposits changed little across the maturity spectrum. Global sovereign yields declined along with U.S. Treas- ury yields following the March FOMC meeting. Foreign equity prices increased, on balance, amid optimism around trade negotiations between the United States and China, stronger-than-expected Chinese data, and accom- modative communications from some foreign central banks. Pronounced political and policy uncertainties led to a significant tightening of financial conditions in Tur- key, Argentina, and, to a lesser extent, Brazil, but spillo- vers to other EMEs were limited, and EME credit spreads were generally little changed on net. The broad dollar index increased modestly, supported by the strength of U.S. economic data relative to foreign data and the accommodative tone from foreign central banks. The British pound declined over the intermeet- ing period amid protracted discussions ahead of the orig- inal Brexit deadline, which was extended to October 31. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re- mained generally accommodative during the intermeet- ing period. Gross issuance of corporate bonds was strong against a backdrop of narrower corporate spreads and improved risk sentiment. Issuance of institutional leveraged loans increased, but refinancing volumes were low and loans spreads remained somewhat elevated. Re- spondents to the April 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opin- ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) re- ported easing some key terms for commercial and in- dustrial (C&I) loans to large and middle-market firms. For instance, banks reported narrowing loan rate spreads, easing loan covenants, and increasing the max- imum size and reducing the costs of credit lines to these firms. C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets grew at a ro- bust pace in the first quarter of 2019. Gross equity issu- ance edged up later in the period and the volume of cor- porate bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of down- grades, suggesting that credit quality of nonfinancial cor- porations, on balance, improved. Financing conditions for the commercial real estate (CRE) sector remained accommodative, and issuance of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage backed se- curities grew steadily. CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets continued to grow in the first quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in previous quarters. Banks in the April SLOOS reported weaker demand across all major types of CRE loans. However, they also reported tightening lending standards for these loans. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained supportive over the intermeeting period. Home mortgage rates decreased about 5 basis points, to levels comparable with 2017. Consistent with lower mortgage rates, home-purchase mortgage originations increased, reversing a yearlong decline. Consumer credit conditions remained broadly support- ive of growth in household spending, with all categories of consumer loans recording steady growth in the first quarter. According to the April SLOOS, commercial banks left lending standards for auto loans and other consumer loans unchanged in the first quarter. How- ever, credit card interest rates rose and standards report- edly tightened for some borrowers. The staff provided an update on its assessments of po- tential risks to financial stability. The staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets to have increased significantly this year, though not quite to the elevated levels that prevailed for much of last year. The staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loos- ened further. The build-up in overall nonfinancial busi- ness debt to levels close to historical highs relative to GDP was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector and the economy more broadly. The staff continued to judge risks associated with household-sector debt as moderate. Both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vulnerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low, as they have been for some time. The staff also noted that the sustained growth of lending by banks to nonbank financial firms represented an increase in finan- cial interconnectedness. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net. Real GDP growth was forecast to slow in the near term from its solid first-quarter pace, as sizable con- tributions from inventory investment and net exports were not expected to persist. The projection for real Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ GDP growth over the medium term was revised up, pri- marily reflecting a lower assumed path for interest rates, a slightly higher trajectory for equity prices, and some- what less appreciation of the broad real dollar. The staff’s lower path for interest rates reflected a methodo- logical change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast. Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate above the staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate and to bottom out in late 2020. With labor market conditions still judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than- usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. The staff’s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly, reflecting some recent softer-than-expected readings on consumer price inflation that were not ex- pected to persist along with the staff’s assessment that the level to which inflation would tend to move in the absence of resource slack or supply shocks was a bit lower in the medium term than previously assumed. As a result, core PCE price inflation was expected to move up in the near term but nevertheless to run just below 2 percent over the medium term. Total PCE price infla- tion was forecast to run a bit below core inflation in 2020 and 2021, reflecting projected declines in energy prices. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. On the upside, household spending and busi- ness investment could expand faster than the staff pro- jected, supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017, still strong overall labor market conditions, favor- able financial conditions, and upbeat consumer senti- ment. On the downside, the softening in some eco- nomic indicators since late last year could be the leading edge of a significant slowing in the pace of economic growth. Moreover, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have signif- icant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended pe- riod was counterbalanced by the downside risks that re- cent soft data on consumer prices could persist and that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast, as well as the possibil- ity that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that labor markets had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. Participants also observed that growth in household spending and business fixed invest- ment had slowed in the first quarter. Overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy, both measured on a 12-month basis, had declined and were running below 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations were little changed. Participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, with strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes. Participants noted the unexpected strength in first-quarter GDP growth, but some observed that the composition of growth, with large contributions from inventories and net exports and more modest contributions from con- sumption and investment, suggested that GDP growth in the near term would likely moderate from its strong pace of last year. For this year as a whole, a number of participants mentioned that they had marked up their projections for real GDP growth, reflecting, in part, the strong first-quarter reading. Participants cited continu- ing strength in labor market conditions, improvements in consumer confidence and in financial conditions, or diminished downside risks both domestically and abroad, as factors likely to support solid growth over the remainder of the year. Some participants observed that, in part because of the waning impetus from fiscal policy and past removal of monetary policy accommodation, they expected real GDP growth to slow over the me- dium term, moving back toward their estimates of trend output growth. In their discussion of the household sector, participants discussed recent indicators, including retail sales and light motor vehicle sales for March, which rose from rel- atively weak readings in some previous months. Taken _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2019Page 9 together, these developments suggested that the first- quarter softness in household spending was likely to prove temporary. With the strong jobs market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer sentiment, growth in PCE in coming months was expected to be solid. Sev- eral participants also noted that while the housing sector had been a drag on GDP growth for some time, recent data pointed to some signs of stabilization. With mort- gage rates at their lowest levels in more than a year, a few participants thought that residential construction could begin to make positive contributions to GDP growth in the near term; a few others were less optimistic. Participants noted that growth of business fixed invest- ment had moderated in the first quarter relative to the average pace recorded last year and discussed whether this more moderate growth was likely to persist. A num- ber of participants expressed optimism that there would be continued growth in capital expenditures this year, al- beit probably at a slower pace than in 2018. Several par- ticipants observed that financial conditions and business sentiment had continued to improve, consistent with re- ports from business contacts in a number of Districts; however, a few others reported less buoyant business sentiment Many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterio- ration in financial conditions or similar concerns ex- pressed by their business contacts had abated to some extent. However, a few participants noted that ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those as- sociated with trade uncertainty and low prices, had been exacerbated by severe flooding in recent weeks. Participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation, and inflation for items other than food and energy, had come in lower than expected. At least part of the recent softness in inflation could be attributed to idiosyncratic factors that seemed likely to have only transitory effects on inflation, including unusually sharp declines in the prices of apparel and of portfolio management services. Some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had ac- counted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years. Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, pro- duced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which re- moves the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these par- ticipants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months. Participants continued to view inflation near the Com- mittee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome, but, in light of recent, softer inflation readings, some viewed the downside risks to inflation as having increased. Some participants also expressed concerns that long-term inflation expectations could be below lev- els consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent target or at risk of falling below that level. Participants agreed that labor market conditions re- mained strong. Job gains in the March employment re- port were solid, the unemployment rate remained low, and, while the labor force participation rate moved down a touch, it remained high relative to estimates of its un- derlying demographically driven, downward trend. Con- tacts in a number of Districts continued to report short- ages of qualified workers, in some cases inducing busi- nesses to find novel ways to attract new workers. A few participants commented that labor market conditions in their Districts were putting upward pressure on compen- sation levels for lower-wage jobs, although there were few reports of a broad-based pickup in wage growth. Several participants noted that business contacts ex- pressed optimism that despite tight labor markets they would be able to find workers or would find technolog- ical solutions for labor shortage problems. Participants commented on risks associated with their outlook for economic activity over the medium term. Some participants viewed risks to the downside for real GDP growth as having decreased, partly because pro- spects for a sharp slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China and Europe, had diminished. These improvements notwithstanding, most participants ob- served that downside risks to the outlook for growth re- main. In discussing developments in financial markets, a num- ber of participants noted that financial market condi- tions had improved following the period of stress ob- served over the fourth quarter of last year and that the volatility in prices and financial conditions had subsided. These factors were thought to have helped buoy con- sumer and business confidence or to have mitigated short-term downside risks to the real economy. More generally, the improvement in financial conditions was regarded by many participants as providing support for the outlook for economic growth and employment. Among those participants who commented on financial stability, most highlighted recent developments related to leveraged loans and corporate bonds as well as the Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ current high level of nonfinancial corporate indebted- ness. A few participants suggested that heightened lev- erage and associated debt burdens could render the busi- ness sector more sensitive to economic downturns than would otherwise be the case. A couple of participants suggested that increases in bank capital in current cir- cumstances with solid economic growth and strong profits could help support financial and macroeconomic stability over the longer run. A couple of participants observed that asset valuations in some markets appeared high, relative to fundamentals. A few participants com- mented on the positive role that the Board’s semi-annual Financial Stability Report could play in facilitating public discussion of risks that could be present in some seg- ments of the financial system. In their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the cur- rent target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. Participants judged that the labor market remained strong, and that information received over the intermeeting period showed that economic activity grew at a solid rate. However, both overall inflation and in- flation for items other than food and energy had de- clined and were running below the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective. A number of participants observed that some of the risks and uncertainties that had surrounded their outlooks earlier in the year had moderated, includ- ing those related to the global economic outlook, Brexit, and trade negotiations. That said, these and other sources of uncertainty remained. In light of global eco- nomic and financial developments as well as muted in- flation pressures, participants generally agreed that a pa- tient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appro- priate. Participants noted that even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve, a patient approach would likely remain warranted, especially in an environment of continued moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures. Participants discussed the potential policy implications of continued low inflation readings. Many participants viewed the recent dip in PCE inflation as likely to be transitory, and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activ- ity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Several participants also judged that patience in adjusting policy was consistent with the Committee’s balanced approach to achieving its objectives in current circumstances in which resource utilization appeared to be high while in- flation continued to run below the Committee’s sym- metric 2 percent objective. However, a few participants noted that if the economy evolved as they expected, the Committee would likely need to firm the stance of mon- etary policy to sustain the economic expansion and keep inflation at levels consistent with the Committee’s objec- tive, or that the Committee would need to be attentive to the possibility that inflation pressures could build quickly in an environment of tight resource utilization. In contrast, a few other participants observed that sub- dued inflation coupled with real wage gains roughly in line with productivity growth might indicate that re- source utilization was not as high as the recent low read- ings of the unemployment rate by themselves would sug- gest. Several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters, there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the Com- mittee’s symmetric 2 percent objective—a development that could make it more difficult to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis over the longer run. Participants emphasized that their monetary policy decisions would continue to depend on their assess- ments of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook, as informed by a wide range of data. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that the information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the la- bor market remained strong and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Growth of household spending and business fixed investment had slowed in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below 2 percent. On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations were little changed. In their consideration of the economic outlook, mem- bers noted that financial conditions had improved since the turn of the year, and many uncertainties affecting the U.S. and global economic outlooks had receded, though some risks remained. Despite solid economic growth and a strong labor market, inflation pressures remained muted. Members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 30–May 1, 2019Page 11 objective as the most likely outcomes for the U.S. econ- omy. In light of global economic and financial develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, members con- curred that the Committee could be patient as it deter- mined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Com- mittee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-em- ployment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into ac- count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and readings on finan- cial and international developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term ad- justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro- priately remain dependent on the evolution of the out- look as informed by incoming data. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove references to a slowing in the pace of economic growth and little-changed payroll employ- ment, consistent with stronger incoming information on these indicators. The description of growth in house- hold spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter was revised to recognize that incoming data had confirmed earlier information that suggested these as- pects of economic activity had slowed at that time. Members also agreed to revise the description of infla- tion to note that inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and was now running below 2 per- cent. Members observed that a patient approach to determin- ing future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely remain appropriate for some time, especially in an environment of moderate eco- nomic growth and muted inflation pressures, even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 2, 2019, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to main- tain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol- iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer- ing rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-coun- terparty limit of $30 billion per day. Effective May 2, 2019, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $15 billion. The Committee directs the Desk to continue re- investing in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market remains strong and that eco- nomic activity rose at a solid rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Growth of household spending and business fixed investment slowed in the first quarter. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have de- clined and are running below 2 percent. On bal- Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ance, market-based measures of inflation com- pensation have remained low in recent months, and survey-based measures of longer-term in- flation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ per- cent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2.35 percent, effective May 2, 2019. Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve bal- ances 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve establishment of the pri- mary credit rate at the existing level of 3.00 percent, ef- fective May 2, 2019. Update from Subcommittee on Communications Governor Clarida reported on the progress of the review of the Federal Reserve’s strategic framework for mone- tary policy. Fed Listens events to hear stakeholders’ views on the strategy, tools, and communications that would best enable the Federal Reserve to meet its statu- tory objectives of maximum employment and price sta- bility had already taken place in two Federal Reserve Dis- tricts. Numerous additional events were planned, in- cluding a research conference scheduled for June at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. Following these pub- lic activities, the Committee was on course to begin its deliberations about the strategic framework at meetings in the second half of 2019. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 18– 19, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on May 1, 2019. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on April 9, 2019, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on March 19–20, 2019. _______________________ James A.

Winford, Information Management Analyst, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors Standing Repurchase Facility The staff briefed the Committee on the possible role of a standing fixed-rate repurchase agreement (repo) facility as part of the monetary policy implementation frame- work; a facility of this type would allow counterparties to obtain temporary liquidity at a fixed rate of interest through repurchase transactions with the Federal Re- serve involving their holdings of select securities eligible for open market operations. The staff presentation noted how such a facility could provide a backstop against unusual spikes in the federal funds rate and other money market rates and might also provide incentives for banks to shift the composition of their portfolios of liquid assets away from reserves and toward high-quality securities. Key design features for such a facility, includ- ing the fixed rate offered to counterparties, the set of eligible counterparties, and the range of securities eligi- ble to be placed at the facility, would influence the effec- tiveness of a facility in achieving either of these objec- tives. The staff noted a number of considerations that could arise in setting these design parameters, including potential repercussions in unsecured and secured fund- Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ing markets, the eligibility of counterparties in weak fi- nancial condition, the potential that turning to such a fa- cility could become stigmatized, and issues of a level playing field across different classes of counterparties. Participants commented on a number of issues in con- nection with key design parameters for a repo facility. In terms of the setting of the facility’s fixed rate, many par- ticipants acknowledged a tradeoff in determining the level of the rate relative to other money market rates. On the one hand, establishing the rate at a narrow spread above money market rates would likely provide better interest rate control and could also be helpful in avoiding stigma that can be associated with the use of standing lending facilities with fixed rates set well above the level of money market rates. On the other hand, setting the rate close to the level of money market rates could result in very sizable Federal Reserve operations on a daily ba- sis that could be viewed as disintermediating the activity of private entities in money markets. In considering the eligible set of counterparties for a repo facility, a number of participants noted that making the facility available only to primary dealers would likely imply that the effects of the facility would be most direct on repo markets, while the influence on the federal funds market would be only indirect. A couple of par- ticipants noted that, particularly if banks were eligible counterparties, it would be important for counterparties of all sizes to have access to funding through the facility on the same terms. A few participants noted that a fa- cility could enhance financial stability by providing a means by which nonbank counterparties can readily ob- tain liquidity against their high-quality assets. A couple of other participants noted ways that a repo facility could have unintended effects on financial stability; for exam- ple, if reserves help support overall financial stability, a facility that significantly reduced the demand for re- serves might not be beneficial. Many participants commented on issues associated with the availability of such a facility to firms in different states of financial condition. Several thought there should not be a guarantee of access to such a facility re- gardless of a firm’s financial condition, while a number of others were willing to consider how such a facility could be structured to work effectively in a stressed en- vironment where high-quality liquid assets were used as collateral. A few participants noted that the availability of the facility to banks during periods of stress, particu- larly when they might be in weak financial condition, could be an important factor determining whether a fa- cility would significantly reduce banks’ demand for re- serves in normal times. In their discussion of key objectives for establishing a repo facility, some participants raised questions about whether such a facility is needed in an ample-reserves framework, noting that the current ample-reserves re- gime has provided good interest rate control. Other par- ticipants commented on the potential benefits of such a facility as a way to enhance interest rate control in the current implementation regime or as a means to operate in the current implementation framework but with a sig- nificantly smaller quantity of reserves than at present. A couple of participants noted that a facility could damp volatility in repo rates. Several participants noted that a facility could possibly aid with multiple policy objectives. A number of participants noted that the policy objec- tives for a fixed-rate standing repo facility would have implications for the appropriate design for the facility. Several participants recognized the need to carefully evaluate possible parameter settings to guard against un- intended consequences, including the potential for moral hazard or a more volatile Federal Reserve balance sheet. In addition, several participants highlighted the importance of evaluating whether other tools or initia- tives could better achieve the desired goals. Overall, no decisions were reached at this meeting; participants stated that additional work would be necessary to clearly define the objectives of such a facility and to evaluate its potential net benefits. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager pro tem discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period. Trade- related developments reportedly led many market partic- ipants to take a more pessimistic view of the U.S. eco- nomic outlook. Equity prices and interest rates fell no- ticeably after the announcement of higher tariffs on Chi- nese imports in early May and then again after news that tariffs might be imposed on Mexican imports. In re- sponse to these developments, markets appeared to be- come more sensitive to incoming news about the out- look for global growth and inflation, including data that pointed to a continued subdued inflation environment and to slower economic growth in the United States and abroad. Treasury yields fell sharply and far-forward measures of inflation compensation dropped significantly in the United States and abroad. Against this backdrop, mar- ket participants reportedly viewed communications by Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Federal Reserve officials as signaling a greater likelihood of a cut in the target range for the federal funds rate later in the year. The expected path of the federal funds rate embedded in futures prices shifted down significantly over the period. In the euro area, far-forward measures of inflation com- pensation fell noticeably, and market participants report- edly increasingly came to believe that further monetary policy accommodation would be needed. Late in the in- termeeting period, remarks by European Central Bank (ECB) President Draghi were interpreted as suggesting increased odds of further asset purchases by the ECB. Euro-area peripheral spreads to German equivalents moved sharply lower, and far-forward inflation compen- sation recovered modestly. The manager pro tem turned next to a review of money market developments and Open Market Desk opera- tions. Money market rates generally stabilized at mod- estly lower levels over the intermeeting period, likely re- flecting both the technical adjustment in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate following the May FOMC meeting and a sizable increase in reserve balances asso- ciated with a decline in balances held by the Treasury in its account at the Federal Reserve. Market participants reported seeing slightly more pass-through from repo rates to the federal funds rate on days with heightened firmness in repo rates. Market participants attributed re- cent increases in repo rates on month-end and mid- month Treasury auction settlement dates in part to ele- vated net dealer inventories of Treasury securities, which dealers finance in the repo market. Regarding open market operations over the period, given the substantial decline in mortgage rates over re- cent months and an associated increase in refinancing activity, principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) had recently moved somewhat above the $20 billion monthly redemption cap. As a result, the Desk began in May to reinvest agency MBS principal payments in ex- cess of the cap. Based on current market rates and pre- payment forecasts, the Desk expected to reinvest mod- est amounts of agency MBS over the coming months and possibly again in 2020, particularly during the sum- mer months. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the June 18–19 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong. Real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be ris- ing at a moderate rate in the second quarter, as house- hold spending growth picked up from the weak first quarter while business fixed investment was soft. Con- sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per- centage change in the price index for personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in April. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta- tions were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded solidly, on average, in April and May; however, job gains slowed sharply in May after a strong increase in April. The un- employment rate declined to 3.6 percent in April and re- mained there in May, its lowest level in 50 years. The labor force participation rate moved down somewhat in April and held steady in May, remaining close to its av- erage over the previous few years; the employment-to- population ratio stayed flat in April and May. The un- employment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics decreased, on net, over April and May and were below their levels at the end of the previous eco- nomic expansion, though persistent differentials in un- employment rates across groups remained. The average share of workers employed part time for economic rea- sons over April and May continued to be below the lows reached in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings moved up in March and held steady in April, while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unem- ployment insurance benefits through early June was near historically low levels. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, slightly lower than in April but somewhat faster than a year earlier. Total labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 1.6 percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter, slower than a year earlier. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in April. This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained well below core inflation, and consumer energy price infla- tion slowed considerably to about the same rate as core inflation. The trimmed mean measure of PCE price in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ las was 2.0 percent over that 12-month period. The con- sumer price index (CPI) rose 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 2.0 percent. The monthly change in core PCE prices in April and the staff’s estimate of the change in May— based on the CPI data and the relevant prices from the producer price index—were higher in both of these months than the very low readings seen in January through March. Recent survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. While measures from the Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were lit- tle changed, the preliminary June reading from the Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers dropped sig- nificantly to below its range in recent years. Growth in real consumer expenditures appeared to pick up to a solid rate in the second quarter from its weak first-quarter pace. The components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to estimate PCE increased in May, and the retail sales data for the previous two months were revised up notably. Sales of light motor vehicles rose sharply in May after stepping down in April. Key factors that influence con- sumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, and still elevated measures of households’ net worth—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment edged down in the preliminary June reading but was still at an upbeat level. Real residential investment in the second quarter looked to be continuing the decline seen earlier in the year, al- beit at a slower rate. Starts of new single-family homes rose in April but fell back in May, while starts of multi- family units increased over both months. Building per- mit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in con- struction of such homes—was at roughly the same level in May as its first-quarter average. Sales of new homes fell notably in April after a marked gain in March, and existing home sales edged down in April. Real nonresidential private fixed investment appeared soft in the second quarter. Real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property looked to be roughly flat, as nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved sideways in April. Forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending pointed to possible decreases in the near term. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined notably in April and continued to be below the level of shipments, readings on business sentiment dete- riorated further, and analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth moved down sharply. Nom- inal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector decreased in April, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to decline through mid-June. Industrial production moved down in April and picked up in May, leaving output about flat over those two months, but production was lower than at the beginning of the year. Manufacturing output declined, on net, over April and May, although mining output expanded. Au- tomakers’ assembly schedules suggested that the pro- duction of light motor vehicles would move up in the near term, but new orders indexes from national and re- gional manufacturing surveys pointed to continued soft total factory output in the coming months. Moreover, industry news indicated that aircraft production would continue to be slow in the near term. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising solidly in the second quarter. Federal government pur- chases were being boosted by strong increases in defense spending through May and the return of nondefense purchases to more typical levels after the partial federal government shutdown in the first quarter. Real pur- chases by state and local governments seemed to be ris- ing modestly; total payrolls of these governments edged down over April and May, but nominal state and local construction spending expanded notably in April. Net exports added substantially to real GDP growth in the first quarter, as exports increased robustly and im- ports fell. After widening in March, the nominal trade deficit narrowed in April; even though exports declined, imports declined by more. The available data suggested that net exports would be a small drag on real GDP growth in the second quarter. Growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in the first quarter, as soft growth in the Canadian economy and weakness in several emerging market economies (EMEs) offset somewhat stronger growth in other ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs) and in China’s econ- omy. Recent indicators suggested that the pace of eco- nomic activity picked up in Canada in the second quarter but slowed in some other AFEs. Economic growth also appeared to have slowed in China. Foreign inflation re- mained subdued but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year, in part reflecting higher retail energy prices in many economies. Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investors’ concerns about downside risks to the eco- nomic outlook weighed on financial markets over the in- termeeting period. Market participants cited negative news about international trade tensions and, to a lesser extent, soft U.S. and foreign economic data as factors that contributed to these developments. Nominal Treasury yields posted notable declines and the expected path of policy shifted down considerably over the pe- riod. Equity prices declined, on net, and corporate bond spreads widened. However, financing conditions for businesses and households generally remained support- ive of economic growth. FOMC communications following the May meeting had little net effect on yields, though they rose modestly fol- lowing the Chair’s press conference. Later in the period, the expected path of policy moved down, partly in re- sponse to incoming information pointing to a weaker economic outlook. The market-implied probability for a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate by the July FOMC meeting rose to about 85 percent. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate for 2019 and 2020 shifted down markedly. Based on overnight index swap rates, investors expected the federal funds rate to decline about 60 basis points by the end of this year—a downward revision of 40 basis points over the intermeeting period. Longer-term Treasury yields fell considerably over the period, with the declines driven primarily by negative headlines about trade tensions between the United States and two major trading partners, China and Mexico. Softer-than-expected domestic economic news, such as the weaker-than-expected employment data, also con- tributed to the declines. The spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields fell to the bottom decile of its distribution since 1971. Measures of inflation com- pensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Se- curities also decreased notably over the period along with declines in oil prices. Major U.S. equity price indexes declined, on net, over the intermeeting period. Equity prices fell notably over the first few weeks of the period, primarily in response to the escalation of trade tensions with China and Mex- ico. Firms with high China exposure and those in cycli- cal sectors—such as energy, information technology, in- dustrials, communication services, and banks—posted particularly large losses. However, later in the period, stock prices regained a significant portion of their losses amid an easing of trade tensions with Mexico and expec- tations of a more accommodative stance of policy. One- month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index— the VIX—increased over the period, and corporate credit spreads widened. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Overnight interest rates in short-term funding markets declined in response to the technical adjustment that reduced the IOER rate 5 basis points to 2.35 percent after the May FOMC meeting. The average of the effective federal funds rate over the period was about 6 basis points below the level just before the May FOMC meeting, well within the FOMC’s target range. Rates on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit also declined some- what. Escalation of trade tensions and soft economic data also weighed on foreign financial markets. Most major global equity price indexes declined, on net, and EME sover- eign spreads widened modestly. In the AFEs, policy ex- pectations and sovereign yields declined notably, in part reflecting more-accommodative monetary policy com- munications by major central banks. The broad dollar index rose a bit over the intermeeting period. The Japanese yen and Swiss franc, which are viewed as safe-haven currencies, appreciated against the dollar. The British pound depreciated amid increased uncertainty around Brexit. Increased trade tensions con- tributed to some depreciation of the Chinese renminbi. The value of the Mexican peso against the dollar fluctu- ated in response to announcements related to potential tariffs on imports from Mexico but ended the period only slightly lower. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses contin- ued to be accommodative overall. Gross issuance of corporate bonds was strong in May following a spell of seasonal weakness in April. The credit quality of nonfi- nancial corporations remained solid, as the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond upgrades outpaced that of downgrades in May. Issuance in the institutional syndi- cated leveraged loan market was subdued in April but rebounded in May, reflecting strong issuance beyond that associated with refinancing of maturing leveraged loans. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial lending slowed somewhat in April and May after a period of stronger growth in the first quarter. Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommo- dative on net. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions continued to be generally accommodative. Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ securities (CMBS) Commercial mortgage-backed spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range. Issuance of agency and non-agency CMBS was solid in May, and CRE lending by banks expanded in April and May at a slower rate than in the first quarter. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained supportive over the intermeeting period. Home mortgage rates decreased about 40 basis points. Since last November, mortgage rates had declined more than 1 percentage point, contributing to an increase in home-purchase mortgage originations to the solid levels seen in 2017. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of household spending, although the supply of credit to consumers with subprime credit scores con- tinued to be tight. Consumer credit expanded at a mod- erate pace in the first quarter, with bank credit data pointing to a pickup in April and May. Conditions in the consumer asset-backed securities market remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with robust issuance and spreads that were little changed at low levels. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting was revised down somewhat on balance. Real GDP growth was forecast to slow to a moderate rate in the second quarter and move down to a more modest pace in the second half of the year, primarily reflecting a more downbeat near-term outlook for business fixed investment. The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was little changed, as the effects of a higher projected path for the broad real dollar and lower trajectory for foreign eco- nomic growth were largely counterbalanced by a lower projected path for interest rates. Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2021 and remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. With labor market conditions judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that 5 In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path projected employment gains would manifest in smaller- than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the la- bor force participation rate. The staff’s forecast for inflation was little changed on balance. The forecast for total PCE price inflation this year was revised down somewhat, reflecting a lower near-term projection for energy prices. The core infla- tion forecast for this year was unchanged at a level below 2 percent. Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years, although uncertainty was seen to have in- creased since the previous forecast. Moreover, the staff also judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth had tilted to the downside, with a skew to the upside for the unemployment rate. The increased un- certainty and shift to downside risks around the projec- tion reflected the staff’s assessment that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants judged that uncertainties and downside risks surrounding the economic outlook had increased signif- icantly over recent weeks. While they continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely out- comes, many participants attached significant odds to scenarios with less favorable outcomes.5 Moreover, nearly all participants in their submissions to the Sum- mary of Economic Projections (SEP), had revised down their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections repre- sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under ap- propriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections and policy assess- ments are described in the Summary of Economic Projec- tions, which is an addendum to these minutes. Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ funds rate over the projection period that would be con- sistent with their modal economic outlook. Many par- ticipants noted that, since the Committee’s previous meeting, the economy appeared to have lost some mo- mentum and pointed to a number of factors supporting that view including recent weak indicators for business confidence, business spending and manufacturing activ- ity; trade developments; and signs of slowing global eco- nomic growth. Many participants noted that they viewed the risks to their growth and inflation projec- tions, such as those emanating from greater uncertainty about trade, as shifting notably over recent weeks and that risks were now weighted to the downside. Participants discussed at some length the softness in var- ious indicators of business fixed investment in the sec- ond quarter. Incoming data on shipments and orders of new capital goods looked weak and recent readings from some manufacturing surveys had dropped sharply. Pri- vate sector analysts had marked down their forecasts for longer-term corporate profit growth. Manufacturing production had posted declines so far this year. In addi- tion, contacts reported that softer export sales, weaker economic activity abroad, and elevated levels of uncer- tainty regarding the global outlook were weighing on business sentiment and leading firms to reassess plans for investment spending. Several participants noted comments from business contacts reporting that their base case now assumed that uncertainties about the global outlook would remain prominent over the me- dium term and would continue to act as a drag on in- vestment. Several participants also noted reports from some business contacts in the manufacturing sector sug- gesting that they were putting capital expenditures or hir- ing plans on hold and were reevaluating their global sup- ply chains in light of trade uncertainties. A couple of participants, however, pointed to signs that investment might pick up, including reports from some contacts that their orders and shipments remained strong and that some contacts planned to hire more workers. A few par- ticipants also noted ongoing challenges in the agricul- tural sector, including those associated with increased trade uncertainty, weak export markets, wet weather, and severe flooding. A few participants remarked on the de- cline in energy prices and the associated reduction in ac- tivity in the energy sector. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that available data on consumer spending had been solid, supported by a strong labor market and rising incomes. Several participants also noted that measures of consumer sentiment remained upbeat, and a couple noted that their business contacts confirmed the view that consumer spending had rebounded from the weak patch earlier in the year. Several participants, however, noted that tariffs could eventually become a drag on consumer durables spending, especially if additional tar- iffs on consumer goods were imposed, and that they would be monitoring incoming data for signs of this ef- fect. A couple of participants noted that the continued softness in the housing sector was a concern, even though the decline in mortgage rates since last fall was expected to provide stronger impetus for activity; a cou- ple of participants were somewhat optimistic that resi- dential investment would pick up. In their discussion of the labor market, participants cited evidence that conditions remained strong, including the very low unemployment rate and the fact that job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months. That said, job gains in May were weaker than expected and, in light of other developments, participants judged that it would be important to closely monitor incoming data for any signs of softening in labor market conditions. Reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong la- bor demand, with many firms planning to hire more workers. Economy-wide wage growth was seen as being broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years. However, a few par- ticipants noted that there were limited signs of upward pressure on wage inflation. A few participants cited the combination of muted inflation pressures, moderate wage growth, and expanding employment as a possible indication that some slack remained in the labor market. Partly reflecting that combination of developments, sev- eral participants had revised down their SEP estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. Participants noted that readings on overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had come in lower than expected over recent months. In light of recent softer inflation readings, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and global disinflationary pressures, many participants viewed the risks to the outlook for in- flation as weighted to the downside. Several participants indicated that, while headline inflation had been close to 2 percent last year, it was noteworthy that inflation had softened this year despite continued strong labor market conditions. Participants generally noted that they re- vised down their SEP projections of inflation for the current year in light of recent data. They still anticipated that the overall rate of inflation would firm somewhat and move up to the Committee’s longer-run symmetric objective of 2 percent over the next few years. Con- sistent with that view, several participants commented that alternative measures of inflation that removed the Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ influence of unusually large changes in the prices of in- dividual items in either direction were running around 2 percent. However, a number of participants antici- pated that the return to 2 percent would take longer than previously projected even with an assumed path for the federal funds rate that was lower than in their previous projections. In their discussion of indicators of inflation expecta- tions, participants generally observed that market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined and were at low levels. Some participants also noted that re- cent readings on some survey measures of consumers’ inflation expectations had declined or stood at histori- cally low levels. Many participants further noted that longer-term inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, or that the continued weakness in in- flation could prompt expectations to slip further. These developments might make it more difficult to achieve their inflation objective on a sustained basis. However, several participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be at levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants generally agreed that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had risen materially since their May meeting, particularly those associated with on- going trade negotiations and slowing economic growth abroad. Other downside risks cited by several partici- pants included the possibility that federal budget negoti- ations could result in a sharp reduction in government spending or that negotiations to raise the federal debt limit could be prolonged. A couple of participants ob- served that an economic deterioration in the United States, if it occurred, might be amplified by significant debt burdens for many firms. A few participants re- marked that an upside risk to the outlook for economic activity and inflation included a scenario in which trade negotiations were resolved favorably and business senti- ment rebounded sharply. In their discussion of financial developments, partici- pants observed that the increase in uncertainty sur- rounding the global outlook had affected risk sentiment in financial markets. While overall financial conditions remained supportive of growth, those conditions ap- peared to be premised importantly on expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy in the near term to help offset the drag on economic growth stemming from uncertainties about the global outlook and other downside risks. Participants also discussed the decline in yields on longer-term Treasury securities in recent months. Many participants noted that the spread be- tween the 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields was now negative, and several noted that their assessment of the risk of a slowing in the economic expansion had in- creased based on either the shape of the yield curve or other financial and economic indicators. A few partici- pants pointed to the growth in debt issuance by nonfi- nancial corporations and still generally high asset valua- tions as developments that warranted continued moni- toring. In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting, participants noted that, under their baseline outlook, the labor market was likely to remain strong with economic activity growing at a moderate pace. However, they judged that the risks and uncertainties surrounding their outlooks, particularly those related to the global economic outlook, had intensified in recent weeks. Moreover, inflation continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective; similarly, inflation for items other than food and energy had remained below 2 percent as well. In addition, some readings on infla- tion expectations had been low. The increase in risks and uncertainties surrounding the outlook was quite re- cent and nearly all participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent at this meeting. However, they noted that it would be important to mon- itor the implications of incoming information and global economic developments for the U.S. economic outlook. A couple of participants favored a cut in the target range at this meeting, judging that a prolonged period with in- flation running below 2 percent warranted a more ac- commodative policy response to firmly center inflation and inflation expectations around the Committee’s sym- metric 2 percent objective. With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, nearly all participants had revised down their assessment of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the projection period in their SEP sub- missions, and some had marked down their estimates of the longer-run normal level of the funds rate as well. Many participants indicated that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy had strengthened. Partici- pants widely noted that the global developments that led to the heightened uncertainties about the economic out- look were quite recent. Many judged additional mone- tary policy accommodation would be warranted in the near term should these recent developments prove to be sustained and continue to weigh on the economic out- look. Several others noted that additional monetary pol- Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ icy accommodation could well be appropriate if incom- ing information showed further deterioration in the out- look. Participants stated a variety of reasons that would call for a lower path of the federal funds rate. Several participants noted that a near-term cut in the target range for the federal funds rate could help cushion the effects of possible future adverse shocks to the economy and, hence, was appropriate policy from a risk-management perspective. Some participants also noted that the con- tinued shortfall in inflation risked a softening of inflation expectations that could slow the sustained return of in- flation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Several participants pointed out that they had revised down their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemploy- ment and, as a result, saw a smaller upward contribution to inflation pressures from tight resource utilization than they had earlier. A few participants were concerned that inflation expectations had already moved below levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective and that it was important to provide additional accommodation in the near term to bolster inflation ex- pectations. A few participants judged that allowing in- flation to run above 2 percent for some time could help strengthen the credibility of the Committee’s commit- ment to its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Some participants suggested that although they now judged that the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would follow a flatter trajectory than they had previously assumed, there was not yet a strong case for a rate cut from current levels. They preferred to gather more in- formation on the trajectory of the economy before con- cluding that a change in policy stance is warranted. A few participants expressed the view that with the econ- omy still in a favorable position in terms of the dual mandate, an easing of policy in an attempt to increase inflation a few tenths of a percentage point risked over- heating the labor markets and fueling financial imbal- ances. Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 per- cent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members noted the significant increase in risks and uncertainties attending the economic outlook. There were signs of weakness in U.S. business spending, and foreign economic data were generally disappointing, raising concerns about the strength of global economic growth. While strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spend- ing, uncertainties and risks regarding the global outlook appeared to be contributing to a deterioration in risk sentiment in financial markets and a decline in business confidence that pointed to a weaker outlook for business investment in the United States. Inflation pressures re- mained muted and some readings on inflation expecta- tions were at low levels. Although nearly all members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent at this meeting, they generally agreed that risks and uncertainties surrounding the eco- nomic outlook had intensified and many judged that ad- ditional policy accommodation would be warranted if they continued to weigh on the economic outlook. One member preferred to lower the target range for the fed- eral funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting, stating that the Committee should ease policy at this meeting to re-center inflation and inflation expectations at the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objectives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the implica- tions of incoming information for the economic out- look. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to several adjustments in the description of the economic situation, including a revision in the descrip- tion of market-based measures of inflation compensa- tion to recognize the recent fall in inflation compensa- tion. The Committee retained the characterization of the most likely outcomes as “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective” but added a clause to emphasize that uncertain- ties about this outlook had increased. In describing the monetary policy outlook, members agreed to remove the “patient” language and to emphasize instead that, in light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee would closely monitor the implications of in- coming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in ac- cordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 20, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $15 billion, and to in agency mortgage- continue reinvesting backed securities the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are ac- ceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market remains strong and that eco- nomic activity is rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed invest- ment have been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 per- cent. Market-based measures of inflation com- pensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2¼ to 2½ percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes, but uncer- tainties about this outlook have increased. In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropri- ate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 per- cent objective. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric Rosengren. Voting against this action: James Bullard. Mr. Bullard dissented because he believed that the cur- rent stance of monetary policy could be better posi- tioned to foster progress toward the Committee’s statu- tory objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. Particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations Minutes of the Meeting of June 18–19, 2019Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ along with the risks to the U.S. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-cen- ter inflation and inflation expectations at levels con- sistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objective and simultaneously provide some insur- ance against unexpected developments that could slow U.S. economic growth. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 2.35 percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex- isting level of 3.00 percent, effective June 20, 2019. Update from Subcommittee on Communications Governor Clarida provided a brief update on the work of the subcommittee on communications. The Fed Lis- tens conferences conducted to date were viewed as suc- cessful in identifying many important issues for the stra- tegic review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and com- munications. Additional Fed Listens events were planned over the remainder of the year. The Committee was likely to begin internal deliberations on aspects of the strategic review over coming FOMC meetings. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 30–31, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on June 19, 2019. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on May 21, 2019, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on April 30–May 1, 2019. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021. Core PCE price inflation was also expected to in- crease over the projection period, rising to 2.0 percent in 2021. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, just over half of the participants expected that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at or slightly above its current level through the end of 2019; almost half projected that a lower level for the federal funds rate would be appropriate by year-end. The median of participants’ assessments of the appro- priate level of the federal funds rate at the end of the projection period was close to the median of their as- sessments of the longer-run federal funds rate level. Nearly all participants lowered their projections for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate, relative to March, at some point in the forecast period. The medi- ans for the federal funds rate for 2020 and 2021 were 50 basis points and 25 basis points lower than in March, respectively. The median of projections for the long-run normal level of the federal funds rate was 25 basis points lower than in the March projections. Most participants regarded the uncertainties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years. About half of the participants viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemployment rate projec- tions as being similar to the average of the past 20 years, and about the same number viewed uncertainty as higher. Participants’ assessments of risks to their out- looks for output growth and the unemployment rate shifted notably relative to their assessments in March. As a result, most participants viewed the risks for GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unem- ployment rate as weighted to the upside. About half of participants viewed the risks to inflation as being broadly balanced, with a similar number viewing inflation risks as being weighted to the downside. In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 18–19, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ- ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af- fect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab- sence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out- comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat- isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. Participants who submitted longer-run projections gen- erally expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2019 would run at or somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate. Thereafter, almost all participants expected real GDP growth to edge down, with the vast majority of partici- pants projecting growth in 2021 to be at or below their estimates of its longer-run rate. All participants who submitted longer-run projections continued to expect that the unemployment rate would run at or below their estimates of its longer-run level through 2021. Com- pared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from March 2019, most participants revised down slightly their projections for the unemployment rate from 2019 through 2021. All participants marked down somewhat their projections for 2019 for total inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), and almost all did so for their projections for core inflation.

One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the federal funds rate. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemploy- ment As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projec- tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi- tional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.1 percent, a bit above the median estimate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent. Almost all participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow over the projection period, with the median projection at 2.0 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021. Rela- tive to the March SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019, 2020, 2021, and the longer run were little changed. The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.6 percent, about ½ per- centage point below the median assessment of its longer- run level of 4.2 percent. The medians of projections for 2020 and 2021 were 3.7 percent and 3.8 percent, respec- tively. These median unemployment rates, along with the median for the unemployment rate in the longer run, were a little lower than those from the March SEP. As was the case in March, almost all participants who sub- mitted longer-run projections expected that the unem- ployment rate in 2021 would be below their estimates of its longer-run level. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate from 2019 to 2021 and in the longer run. The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 through 2021 all shifted up modestly relative to that in the March SEP. The distribution for the longer-run growth rate was little changed. The dis- tributions of individual projections for the unemploy- ment rate in 2019 and 2020 moved lower relative to those in March, and the distribution in 2021 edged down as well. Meanwhile, the distribution for the longer-run unemployment rate shifted down a touch. The Outlook for Inflation As shown in table 1, the median of projections for total PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2019, notably lower than in the March SEP, while the median for 2020, at 1.9 percent, was a touch lower than in March. The median for total inflation for 2021 was unchanged from March at 2.0 percent. The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation for 2019 and 2020 were 1.8 per- cent and 1.9 percent, respectively, both a little lower rel- ative to the March SEP. The median for 2021 was 2.0 percent, unchanged from the March SEP. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri- butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in- flation. The distributions of projections for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation in 2019 shifted down notably from the March SEP, while those for 2020 and 2021 changed more modestly. Beyond the current year, for which projections also reflect data in hand, almost all participants expected total and core PCE price inflation to be between 1.9 and 2.2 percent. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg- ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2021 and over the longer run. On the whole, the distributions for 2019 through 2021 shifted toward lower values. Almost all participants viewed the appropriate levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 as lower than those that they deemed appropriate in March. Nearly all partici- pants lowered their projections for the appropriate level of the federal funds rate, relative to March, at some point in the projection period, and none raised their projec- tions for the federal funds rate for any year. Compared with the projections prepared for the March SEP, the median federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower in 2020, 25 basis points lower in 2021, and 25 basis points lower in the longer-run. While the median of federal funds rate projections at the end of 2019 remained at 2.38 percent, almost half of participants projected an ap- propriate level of the target range for the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 that was 25 basis points or 50 ba- sis points lower than at present. In subsequent years, the medians of the projections were 2.13 percent at the end of 2020 and 2.38 percent at the end of 2021, slightly lower than the median of the longer-run projections of the federal funds rate of 2.50 percent. Muted inflation pressures and concerns about declining inflation expec- tations, trade developments, and foreign economic growth, as well as weaker business fixed investment, were cited as factors contributing to the downward revi- sions in participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for the policy rate. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His- torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx. doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020. 1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts display the SEP medians for the three variables sur- rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the de- gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncer- tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore- cast horizon lengthens. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The vast majority of participants continued to view the uncertainty around their projections for inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years; most also viewed uncertainty around their projections for GDP growth as similar to the average of the past 20 years. Views on uncertainty around unemployment rate projections were roughly evenly distributed between those who saw similar levels of uncertainty relative to the historical average and those who saw higher uncer- tainty.2 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The balance of risks to the pro- jection for real GDP growth shifted lower, with 14 par- ticipants assessing the risks as weighted to the downside, 3 assessing them to be broadly balanced, and no partici- pant seeing them as weighted to the upside. Similarly, the balance of risks to the projection for the unemploy- ment rate moved higher, with 12 participants judging the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside and 5 participants viewing the risks as broadly balanced. In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation projec- tions shifted down relative to March. Six more partici- pants than in March saw the risks to the inflation projec- tions as weighted to the downside, and no participant judged the risks as weighted to the upside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, trade developments, concerns about global economic growth, and weaker business fixed investment were mentioned by participants as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. eco- nomic growth outlook. For the inflation outlook, the effect of trade developments was cited as a source of up- side risk, while the possibility that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or the potential for a stronger dollar or weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as down- side risks. A number of participants mentioned that their assessments of risks remained roughly balanced in part because the downward revisions to their appropri- ate path for the federal funds rate were offsetting factors that would otherwise contribute to asymmetric risks. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel- opments over time in key economic variables such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation, 2 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

Figure 5 provides a graphical representa- tion of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the results presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence inter- vals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projec- tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet- rically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.

Bromagen, First Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago David Altig, Michael Dotsey, and Jeffrey Fuhrer, Executive Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Boston, respectively Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices Committee participants began their discussions related to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Staff briefings provided a retrospective on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy actions since the financial cri- sis, together with background and analysis regarding some key issues. In its policy response during the reces- sion and the subsequent economic recovery, the Com- mittee lowered the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound (ELB) and provided additional monetary policy accommodation through both forward guidance about the expected path of the policy rate and balance sheet policy. These actions eased financial conditions and provided substantial support to economic activity; they therefore figured importantly in helping promote the recovery in the labor market and in preventing infla- tion from falling substantially below the Committee’s objective. The presentation noted, however, that over the past several years, inflation had tended to run mod- estly below the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 per- cent, while some indicators of longer-run inflation ex- pectations currently stood at low levels. The staff also provided results from model simulations that illustrated Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ possible challenges to the achievement of the Commit- tee’s dual-mandate goals over the medium term. These challenges included the proximity of the policy rate to the ELB, imprecise knowledge about the neutral value of the policy rate and the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate, the diminished response of infla- tion to resource utilization, and uncertainty about the re- lationship between inflation expectations and inflation outcomes. In their discussion, participants welcomed the review of the monetary policy framework. They noted that the in- clusion of feedback from the public as part of the review, via the Fed Listens events, had improved the transparency of the review process, enhanced the Federal Reserve’s public accountability, and provided insights into the pos- itive implications of strong labor markets and high rates of employment for various communities. Furthermore, participants agreed that the review was timely and war- ranted, in light of the use over the past decade of new policy tools and the emergence of changes in the struc- ture and operation of the U.S. economy. These changes included the long period during which the federal funds rate was at the ELB, the probable recurrence of ELB episodes if the neutral level of the policy rate remains at historically low levels, and the challenges that policymak- ers face in influencing inflation and inflation expecta- tions when the response of inflation to resource utiliza- tion has diminished. Participants generally agreed that the Committee’s consideration of possible modifications to its policy strategy, tools, and communication practices would take some time and that the process would be careful, deliberate, and patient. With regard to the current monetary policy framework, participants agreed that this framework had served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past dec- ade. They judged that forward guidance and balance sheet actions had provided policy accommodation dur- ing the ELB period and had supported economic activity and a return to strong labor market conditions while also bringing inflation closer to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent than would otherwise have been the case. In addition, participants noted that the Commit- tee’s balanced approach to promoting its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability had facili- tated Committee policy actions aimed at supporting the labor market and economic activity even during times when the provision of accommodation was potentially associated with the risk of inflation running persistently above 2 percent. Participants further observed that such inflation risks—along with several of the other perceived risks of providing substantial accommodation through nontraditional policy tools, including possible adverse implications for financial stability—had not been real- ized. In particular, a number of participants commented that, as many of the potential costs of the Committee’s asset purchases had failed to materialize, the Federal Re- serve might have been able to make use of balance sheet tools even more aggressively over the past decade in providing appropriate levels of accommodation. How- ever, several participants remarked that considerable un- certainties remained about the costs and efficacy of asset purchases, and a couple of participants suggested that, taking account of the uncertainties and the perceived constraints facing policymakers in the years following the recession, the Committee’s decisions on the amount of policy accommodation to provide through asset pur- chases had been appropriate. In their discussion of policy tools, participants noted that the experience acquired by the Committee with the use of forward guidance and asset purchases has led to an improved understanding of how these tools operate; as a result, the Committee could proceed more confi- dently and preemptively in using these tools in the future if economic circumstances warranted. Participants dis- cussed the extent to which forward guidance and balance sheet actions could substitute for reductions in the pol- icy rate when the policy rate is constrained by the ELB. Overall, participants judged that the Federal Reserve’s ability to provide monetary policy accommodation at the ELB through the use of forward guidance and balance sheet tools, while helpful in mitigating the effects of the constraint on monetary policy arising from the lower bound, did not eliminate the risk of protracted periods in which the ELB hinders the conduct of policy. If pol- icymakers are not able to provide sufficient accommo- dation at the ELB through the use of forward guidance or balance sheet actions, the constraints posed by the ELB could be an impediment to the attainment of the Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives over time and put at risk the anchoring of inflation expectations at the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective. Participants looked forward to a detailed discussion over coming meetings of alternative strategies for monetary policy. Some participants offered remarks on general features of some of the monetary policy strategies that they would be discussing and on the relationship be- tween those strategies and the current framework. A few of the options mentioned were “makeup strategies,” in which the realization of inflation below the 2 percent objective would give rise to policy actions designed to deliver inflation above the objective for a time. In prin- _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019Page 3 ciple, such makeup strategies could be designed to pro- mote a 2 percent inflation rate, on average, over some period. In such circumstances, market expectations that the central bank would seek to “make up” inflation shortfalls following periods during which the ELB was binding could help ease overall financial conditions and thus help support economic activity during ELB epi- sodes. However, many participants noted that the ben- efits of makeup strategies in supporting economic activ- ity and stabilizing inflation depended heavily on the pri- vate sector’s understanding of those strategies and con- fidence that future policymakers would take actions con- sistent with those strategies. A few participants sug- gested that an alternative means of delivering average in- flation equal to the Committee’s longer-run objective might involve aiming for inflation somewhat in excess of 2 percent when the policy rate was away from the ELB, recognizing that inflation would tend to move lower when the policy rate was constrained by the ELB. Another possibility might be for the Committee to ex- press the inflation goal as a range centered on 2 percent and aim to achieve inflation outcomes in the upper end of the range in periods when resource utilization was high. A couple of participants noted that an adoption of a target range would be consistent with the practice of some other central banks. A few other participants sug- gested that the adoption of a range could convey a mes- sage that small deviations of inflation from 2 percent were unlikely to give rise to sizable policy responses. A couple of participants expressed concern that if policy- makers regularly failed to respond appropriately to per- sistent, relatively small shortfalls of inflation below the 2 percent longer-run objective, inflation expectations and average observed inflation could drift below that ob- jective. Participants also discussed the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants noted that this statement had been helpful in articulating and clarifying the Federal Reserve’s ap- proach to monetary policy. The Committee first re- leased this document in January 2012 and had renewed it, with a few modifications, every year since then. On the basis of the monetary policy and economic experi- ence of the past decade, participants cited a number of topics that they would likely discuss in detail in their de- liberations during the review and that might motivate possible modifications to the statement. These topics included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the ELB constraint, the role of inflation expectations in monetary policy, the best means of conveying the Committee’s balanced approach to monetary policy and the symmetry of its inflation goal, the relationship be- tween the Committee’s strategy and its decisions about the settings of its policy tools, the implications of the low value of the neutral policy rate and of uncertainty about the values of the neutral policy rate and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, the potential benefits and costs of unemployment running below its longer-run normal rate in conditions of muted inflation pressures, and the time frame over which policymakers aimed to achieve their dual-mandate goals. A couple of partici- pants emphasized the availability to policymakers of other communication tools through which the Commit- tee could elaborate on its policy strategy and the chal- lenges that monetary policy faced in the current environ- ment, while also indicating that the Committee retains flexibility and optionality to achieve its objectives. Par- ticipants highlighted the importance of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) in conveying participants’ modal outlooks, with several participants suggesting that modifications to the SEP’s format might enhance policy communications. Participants also commented on the importance of considering the connections between monetary policy and financial stability. Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. These additional discussions would consider various topics, such as alternative policy strategies, options for enhanced use of existing monetary policy tools, possible additions to the policy toolkit, po- tential changes to communication practices, the relation- ship between monetary policy and financial stability, and the distributional effects of monetary policy. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager pro tem discussed developments in finan- cial markets over the intermeeting period. Regarding market participants’ views about the July FOMC meet- ing, nearly all respondents from the July Open Market Desk surveys of dealers and market participants ex- pected a 25 basis point cut in the target range for the federal funds rate, a substantial shift from the June sur- veys when a significant majority had a modal forecast for no change. Survey responses also suggested that expec- tations had coalesced around a modal forecast for a total of two 25 basis point cuts in the target range in 2019 and no change thereafter through year-end 2021. Regarding balance sheet policy, survey respondents that expected a rate cut at this meeting were almost evenly split on whether the Committee would also choose to end bal- ance runoff immediately after the meeting or to maintain Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the existing plan to halt runoff at the end of September. Market participants generally judged that a two-month change in the timing of the end of the balance sheet run- off would have only a small effect on the path of the balance sheet and thus very little, if any, economic effect. Expectations for near-term domestic policy easing had occurred against the backdrop of a global shift toward more accommodative monetary policy. Several central banks had eased policy over the past month and a num- ber of others shifted to an easing bias. Market partici- pants were particularly attentive to a statement after the European Central Bank’s Governing Council meeting that was perceived as affirming expectations for further easing and additional asset purchases. These changes to the policy outlook in the United States and across a num- ber of countries appeared to play an important role in supporting financial conditions and offsetting some of the drag on growth from trade tensions and other risks. Somewhat reduced concern among market participants about important risks to the global outlook also ap- peared to support risk asset prices. Following the G-20 (Group of Twenty) meeting in late June, fewer Desk contacts and respondents to the Desk surveys expected a significant escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions. In addition, investor sentiment was bolstered by news that the Administration and Congress had reached a budget and debt ceiling agreement that, if passed, would remove another source of risk later this year. That said, contacts recognized that some potentially sizeable downside risks remained. Many survey respondents still viewed U.S.- China trade risks as skewed to the downside, and many Desk contacts judged that the risks of a “no-deal” Brexit had increased. The manager pro tem next discussed developments in money markets and open market operations. The spreads of the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the median Eurodollar rate relative to the interest on ex- cess reserves (IOER) rate had increased some and be- come more variable over recent months, with a notable pickup in daily changes in these spreads since late March. Moreover, the range of rates in unsecured markets each day had widened. Market participants pointed to pres- sures in repurchase agreement (repo) markets as one fac- tor contributing to the uptick in volatility in unsecured rates. These pressures, in turn, seemed to stem partly from elevated dealer inventories of Treasury securities and dealers’ associated financing needs. Market partici- pants also pointed to lower reserve balances as a factor affecting rates in unsecured money market rates. Over the intermeeting period, the level of reserves was little changed on net; however, some market participants noted the association between the gradual increase in un- secured rates relative to the IOER rate over recent months and the declining level of reserves since System Open Market Account (SOMA) redemptions began. The level of reserves was expected to decline appreciably over coming months, partly reflecting an anticipated siz- able increase in the Treasury’s balance at the Federal Re- serve following the agreement on the federal budget and debt ceiling. The manager pro tem updated the Committee on Desk plans to resume CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Secu- rities Identification Procedures) aggregation of SOMA holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency mort- gage-backed securities (MBS) to reduce administrative costs and operational complexity, and the Desk expects to release a statement in August with details on the ag- gregation strategy. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the July 30–31 meeting in- dicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a moderate rate in the second quarter. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in June. Survey- based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid rate, on average, in recent months, supported by a brisk gain in June. The unemployment rate edged up to 3.7 percent in June but was still at a historically low level. The labor force participation rate also moved up some- what but was close to its average over the previous few years, and the employment-to-population ratio stayed flat. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Asians declined in June, the rate for whites was un- changed, and the rate for Hispanics edged up; the unem- ployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persis- tent differentials between these rates remained. The share of workers employed part time for economic rea- sons in June continued to be below the lows reached in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings held steady in May, while the rate of quits edged down but _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019Page 5 was still at a high level; the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-July was near historically low levels. Aver- age hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in June, somewhat faster than a year earlier. The employment cost index for pri- vate-sector workers increased 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, the same as a year earlier. (Data on compensation per hour that reflected the re- cent annual update of the national income and product accounts by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) were not available at the time of the meeting.) Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in June. This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained be- low core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined. The average monthly change in the core PCE price index during the second quarter was faster than in the first quarter, suggesting that some of the soft inflation read- ings early in the year were transitory. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent. Recent survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta- tions were little changed on balance. The preliminary July reading from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers moved back up after dipping in June but was still at a relatively low level; the measures from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed. Real consumer expenditures rose briskly in the second quarter after a sluggish gain in the first quarter, sup- ported in part by a robust pace of light motor vehicle sales in May and June. However, real PCE rose more slowly in June than in the first five months of the year, suggesting some deceleration in consumer spending go- ing into the third quarter. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, and ele- vated measures of households’ net worth—were sup- portive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, the preliminary July reading on the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment remained at an upbeat level. Real residential investment declined again in the second quarter. Although starts of new single-family homes rose in June, the average in the second quarter was lower than in the first quarter; starts of multifamily units fell back in June but rose for the second quarter as a whole. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes— which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homes—was at roughly the same level in June as its first-quarter average. On net in May and June, sales of new homes declined, while sales of existing homes rose. Real nonresidential private fixed investment edged down in the second quarter, as a decline in expenditures on nonresidential structures more than offset an increase in expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property. Forward-looking indicators of fixed invest- ment were mixed. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in June, and some measures of business sentiment improved. However, analysts’ ex- pectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth remained soft, trade policy concerns appeared to be weighing on investment, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to decrease in recent weeks. Industrial production (IP) was unchanged in June, as a decrease in the output of utilities offset increases in the output of manufacturers and mines. For the second quarter as a whole, both total IP and manufacturing out- put declined, while mining output rose notably, sup- ported by a strong gain in crude oil extraction. Au- tomakers’ assembly schedules suggested that production of light motor vehicles would move up somewhat in the third quarter. However, new orders indexes from na- tional and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to- ward continued softness in manufacturing production in coming months. Total real government purchases rose solidly in the sec- ond quarter. Federal defense spending increased, and nondefense purchases returned to more typical levels af- ter the partial federal government shutdown in the first quarter. Real purchases by state and local governments rose moderately, boosted by a strong gain in spending on structures and an increase in the payrolls of those governments. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in May relative to April, as imports increased more than ex- ports. In June, preliminary data indicated declining nominal goods exports and imports. Within exports, de- clines were particularly notable for exports of consumer Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ goods and capital goods, the latter of which had already been depressed by the suspension of Boeing 737 MAX exports. All told, the BEA estimates that net exports, after adding moderately to first-quarter GDP growth, subtracted a similar amount from GDP growth in the second quarter on declining exports and flat imports. Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subdued in the second quarter. In several key advanced foreign economies, including the euro area, recent indicators pointed to slowing economic growth amid continued weakness in manufacturing and persistent policy-related uncertainty. Similarly, in China, real GDP growth slowed notably in the second quarter after a first-quarter jump. In contrast, growth in Canada and, to a lesser extent, Latin America appeared to pick up from a weak first-quarter pace. Foreign inflation re- mained muted but rose a bit from lows earlier in the year, largely reflecting higher energy prices. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, financial market develop- ments reflected noticeable shifts in expectations for monetary policy in response to Federal Reserve commu- nications, economic data releases, and trade policy de- velopments. Federal Reserve communications were generally regarded as more accommodative than had been anticipated, exerting downward pressure on measures of the expected path for the federal funds rate. However, some better-than-expected economic data re- leases and a slight improvement in the outlook regarding trade partially offset these declines. Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little changed on net. Equity prices increased, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and inflation compensation rose modestly. Financing condi- tions for businesses and households were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained generally supportive of spending. Measures of expectations for near-term domestic mon- etary policy exhibited notable shifts and reversals over the intermeeting period and ended the period little changed, on net, with market participants still attaching high odds to a 25 basis point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the July FOMC meet- ing. Consistent with significant variation in near-term expectations for monetary policy, market-based indica- tors of interest rate uncertainty for shorter maturities over the near term remained somewhat elevated. Over the intermeeting period, market-based expectations for the federal funds rate for the end of this year and beyond moved down slightly on net. A straight read of OIS (overnight index swap) forward rates implied that the federal funds rate would decline about 60 basis points in 2019 and about 35 basis points in 2020. The nominal U.S. Treasury yield curve was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. Both the near-term forward spread and the spread between 10-year and 3-month Treasury yields are still in the bot- tom decile of their respective distributions since 1971. On net, in the weeks following the June FOMC meeting, 5-year and 5-to-10-year inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) moved up modestly. More-accommodative-than-expected Fed- eral Reserve communications, stronger-than-expected inflation data releases, and rising oil prices—amid in- creased geopolitical tensions with Iran—contributed to the upward pressure on inflation compensation. Broad stock price indexes increased, on net, over the in- termeeting period, with notable increases following the June FOMC communications, the Chair’s July Monetary Policy Report testimony, and announcements regarding trade negotiations following the G-20 meeting. Addi- tionally, there was a slight positive reaction to news of an agreement on the federal budget and debt limit. Eq- uity price increases were broad based across major sec- tors, with technology, financial, and communication ser- vices firms outperforming broad indexes. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—decreased slightly, on net, and corporate credit spreads narrowed. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets re- mained fairly stable. Overnight interest rates in both un- secured and secured markets were somewhat elevated over the period. In particular, repo rates were elevated on and after the June quarter-end, with the SOFR (Se- cured Overnight Financing Rate) averaging 8 basis points above the IOER rate over the intermeeting pe- riod. However, the EFFR remained well within the tar- get range, averaging 5 basis points above the IOER rate. Rates on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit declined somewhat. Accommodative central bank communications, both in the United States and abroad, and some easing of trade tensions generally supported foreign risky assets over the intermeeting period. Global equity indexes increased modestly, while emerging market sovereign spreads nar- rowed. On balance, the broad dollar index ended the period modestly lower. Notably, the British pound de- preciated significantly against the U.S. dollar, reportedly as developments led investors to raise the probability they attached to a no-deal Brexit. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019Page 7 Most sovereign long-term bond yields edged lower, on net, reflecting firming expectations for further policy ac- commodation amid growing concerns about the global economic outlook. Italian yields declined notably, in part as the government passed some fiscal consolidation measures. The European Central Bank left its policy rate unchanged at its July meeting but signaled possible rate cuts at coming meetings and said it will explore options for additional asset purchases. Several emerging market central banks, including South Korea, Turkey, and Indo- nesia, lowered policy rates over the period. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re- mained accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate bonds remained robust in June, followed by a typical sea- sonal decline in July. Issuance of institutional leveraged loans increased notably in May but in June, it returned to the more moderate pace observed earlier this year. Respondents to the July 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opin- ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) re- ported that, on net, banks continued to ease standards and terms on commercial and industrial loans to large and middle-market firms in the second quarter, with many citing aggressive competition as the reason for do- ing so. Gross equity issuance has been strong in recent months. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations continued to show signs of stabilization in June follow- ing some deterioration earlier in the year. Credit condi- tions for both small businesses and municipalities re- mained accommodative on balance. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained generally accommodative despite a modest deceleration in bank loan growth. Banks in the July SLOOS reported that standards were about un- changed, on net, in the second quarter for most CRE loan categories. Agency and non-agency commercial MBS issuance was strong in the second quarter, as yield spreads ticked down. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative over the intermeeting period. Mortgage rates were little changed since the June FOMC meeting but remained about 1 percentage point below their late-2018 level. These conditions have supported a modest increase in home-purchase origination volume in recent months. Refinance originations have risen as well but remain near historical lows. In consumer credit markets, financing conditions were little changed in recent months and remained generally supportive of consumer spending. Growth in consumer credit in April and May was up a bit from earlier in the year due to a pickup in credit card balances. Banks in the July SLOOS continued to report tightened standards for credit cards over the second quarter. The staff provided an update on its assessments of po- tential risks to financial stability. On balance, the staff continued to view vulnerabilities as moderate. The staff judged asset valuation pressures to be notable in a num- ber of markets, supported in part by the low level of Treasury yields. In assessing vulnerabilities stemming from leverage in the household and business sectors, the staff noted that business leverage was high while house- hold leverage was moderate. The staff viewed the buildup in nonfinancial business-sector debt as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector and the economy more generally. Within business debt, the staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market, the share of new loans to risky borrowers was at a record high, and credit extended by private equity firms had continued to grow. At the same time, financial institu- tions were viewed as resilient, as the risks associated with financial leverage and funding risk were still viewed as low despite some signs of rising leverage and continued inflows into run-prone funds. Separately, the staff noted that market liquidity was, overall, in good shape, al- though sudden price drops had become more frequent in some markets. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was revised up somewhat in the near term, as an upward revision to households’ real disposable income in the first half of the year led to a slightly higher second-half forecast for consumer spending. Even so, real GDP growth was still forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half, primarily reflecting continued soft business investment and a slower increase in govern- ment spending. The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was a little stronger, supported by the effects of a higher projected path for equity prices and a lower trajectory for interest rates. Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s esti- mate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2021 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. With labor market conditions judged to be tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would man- ifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The staff’s forecast of total PCE price inflation this year was revised up a touch, reflecting a slightly higher pro- jected path for consumer energy prices, while the fore- cast for core PCE price inflation was unrevised at a level below 2 percent. Both total and core inflation were pro- jected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but never- theless to continue to run below 2 percent. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up- side for the unemployment rate. Important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant nega- tive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in busi- ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected. With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Although growth of household spending had picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment had been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compen- sation remained low; survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations were little changed. Participants continued to view a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes. This outlook was predicated on financial conditions that were more ac- commodative than earlier this year. More accommoda- tive financial conditions, in turn, partly reflected market reaction to the downward adjustment through the course of the year in the Committee’s assessment of the appropriate path for the target range of the federal funds rate in light of weak global economic growth, trade pol- icy uncertainty, and muted inflation pressures. Participants generally noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that the economy had been resilient in the face of ongoing global developments. The economy continued to ex- pand at a moderate pace, and participants generally ex- pected GDP growth to slow a bit to around its estimated potential rate in the second half of the year. However, participants also observed that global economic growth had been disappointing, especially in China and the euro area, and that trade policy uncertainty, although waning some over the intermeeting period, remained elevated and looked likely to persist. Furthermore, inflation pres- sures continued to be muted, notwithstanding the firm- ing in the overall and core PCE price indexes in the three months ending in June relative to earlier in the year. In their discussion of the business sector, participants generally saw uncertainty surrounding trade policy and concerns about global growth as continuing to weigh on business confidence and firms’ capital expenditure plans. Participants generally judged that the risks associated with trade uncertainty would remain a persistent head- wind for the outlook, with a number of participants re- porting that their business contacts were making deci- sions based on their view that uncertainties around trade were not likely to dissipate anytime soon. Some partici- pants observed that trade uncertainties had receded somewhat, especially with the easing of trade tensions with Mexico and China. Several participants noted that, over the intermeeting period, business sentiment seemed to improve a bit and commented that the data for new capital goods orders had improved. Some participants expressed the view that the effects of trade uncertainty had so far been modest and referenced reports from business contacts in their Districts that investment plans were continuing, though with a more cautious posture. Participants also discussed developments across the manufacturing, agriculture, and energy sectors of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing production had declined so far this year, dragged down in part by weak real ex- ports, the ongoing global slowdown, and trade uncer- tainties. Several participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with increased trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and the effects of wet weather and severe flooding. A couple of participants commented on the decline in energy prices since last fall and the associated reduction in eco- nomic activity in the energy sector. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019Page 9 Participants commented on the robust pace of con- sumer spending. Noting the important role that house- hold spending was currently playing in supporting the expansion, participants judged that household spending would likely continue to be supported by strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer sentiment. A few participants noted that the continued softness in residential investment was a concern, and that the expected boost to housing activity from the de- cline in mortgage rates since last fall had not yet materi- alized. In contrast, a couple of participants reported that some recent indicators of housing activity in their Dis- tricts had been somewhat more positive of late. In their discussion of the labor market, participants judged that conditions remained strong, with the unem- ployment rate near historical lows and continued solid job gains, on average, in recent months. Job gains in June were stronger than expected, following a weak reading in May. Looking ahead, participants expected the labor market to remain strong, with the pace of job gains slower than last year but above what is estimated to be necessary to hold labor utilization steady. Reports from business contacts pointed to continued strong la- bor demand, with many firms reporting difficulty finding workers to meet current demand. Several participants reported seeing notable wage pressures for lower-wage workers. However, participants viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with the modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and, consequently, as not exerting much upward pressure on inflation. Several participants remarked that there seemed to be little sign of overheating in labor markets, citing the combination of muted inflation pressures and moderate wage growth. Regarding inflation developments, some participants stressed that, even with the firming of readings for con- sumer prices in recent months, both overall and core PCE price inflation rates continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective; the latest reading on the 12-month change in the core PCE price index was 1.6 percent. Furthermore, continued weak- ness in global economic growth and ongoing trade ten- sions had the potential to slow U.S. economic activity and thus further delay a sustained return of inflation to the 2 percent objective. Many other participants, how- ever, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with the view that the lower readings earlier this year were largely transitory, and noted that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was running around 2 percent. A few participants noted differences in the behavior of measures of cyclical and acyclical components of infla- tion. By some estimates, the cyclical component of in- flation continued to firm; the acyclical component, which appeared to be influenced by sectoral and techno- logical changes, was largely responsible for the low level of inflation and not likely to respond much to monetary policy actions. In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, partici- pants generally anticipated that with appropriate policy, inflation would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, market- based measures of inflation compensation and some sur- vey measures of consumers’ inflation expectations re- mained low, although they had moved up some of late. A few participants remarked that inflation expectations appeared to be reasonably well anchored at levels con- sistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec- tive. However, some participants stressed that the pro- longed shortfall in inflation from the long-run goal could cause inflation expectations to drift down—a develop- ment that might make it more difficult to achieve the Committee’s mandated goals on a sustained basis, espe- cially in the current environment of global disinflation- ary pressures. A couple of participants observed that, although some indicators of longer-term inflation expec- tations, like TIPS-based inflation compensation and the Michigan survey measure, had not changed substantially this year, on net, they were notably lower than their lev- els several years ago. Participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had diminished somewhat since their June meeting. The strong June employment report suggested that the weak May payroll figures were not a precursor to a more material slowdown in job growth. The agreement between the United States and China to resume negotiations appeared to ease trade ten- sions somewhat. In addition, many participants noted that the recent agreement on the federal debt ceiling and budget appropriations substantially reduced near-term fiscal policy uncertainty. Moreover, the possibility of fa- vorable outcomes of trade negotiations could be a factor that would provide a boost to economic activity in the future. Still, important downside risks persisted. In par- ticular, participants were mindful that trade tensions were far from settled and that trade uncertainties could intensify again. Continued weakness in global economic growth remained a significant downside risk, and some participants noted that the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit had increased. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of financial market developments, participants observed that financial conditions remained supportive of economic growth, with borrowing rates low and stock prices near all-time highs. Participants ob- served that current financial conditions appeared to be premised importantly on expectations that the Federal Reserve would ease policy to help offset the drag on eco- nomic growth stemming from the weaker global outlook and uncertainties associated with international trade as well as to provide some insurance to address various downside risks. Participants also discussed the decline in yields on longer-term nominal Treasury securities in recent months. A few participants expressed the con- cern that the inversion of the Treasury yield curve, as evidenced by the 10-year yield falling below the 3-month yield, had persisted for about two months, which could indicate that market participants anticipated weaker eco- nomic conditions in the future and that the Federal Re- serve would soon need to lower the federal funds rate substantially in response. The longer-horizon real for- ward rate implied by TIPS had also declined, suggesting that the longer-run normal level of the real federal funds rate implicit in market prices was lower. Among those participants who commented on financial stability, most highlighted recent credit market develop- ments, the elevated valuations in some asset markets, and the high level of nonfinancial corporate indebted- ness. Several participants noted that high levels of cor- porate debt and leveraged lending posed some risks to the outlook. A few participants discussed the fast growth of private credit markets—a sector not subject to the same degree of regulatory scrutiny and require- ments that applies in the banking sector—and com- mented that it was important to monitor this market. Several participants observed that valuations in equity and corporate bond markets were near all-time highs and that CRE valuations were also elevated. A couple of par- ticipants noted that the low level of Treasury yields—a factor seen as supporting asset prices across a range of markets—was a potential source of risk if yields moved sharply higher. However, these participants judged that in the near term, such risks were small in light of the monetary policy outlooks in the United States and abroad and generally subdued inflation. A few partici- pants expressed the concern that capital ratios at the largest banks had continued to fall at a time when they should ideally be rising and that capital ratios were ex- pected to decline further. Another view was that finan- cial stability risks at present are moderate and that the largest banks would continue to maintain very substan- tial capital cushions in light of a range of regulatory re- quirements, including rigorous stress tests. In their discussion of monetary policy decisions at this meeting, those participants who favored a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate pointed to three broad categories of reasons for supporting that ac- tion.  First, while the overall outlook remained favorable, there had been signs of deceleration in economic ac- tivity in recent quarters, particularly in business fixed investment and manufacturing. A pronounced slowing in economic growth in overseas econo- mies—perhaps related in part to developments in, and uncertainties surrounding, international trade— appeared to be an important factor in this decelera- tion. More generally, such developments were among those that had led most participants over re- cent quarters to revise down their estimates of the policy rate path that would be appropriate to pro- mote maximum employment and stable prices.  Second, a policy easing at this meeting would be a prudent step from a risk-management perspective. Despite some encouraging signs over the intermeet- ing period, many of the risks and uncertainties sur- rounding the economic outlook that had been a source of concern in June had remained elevated, particularly those associated with the global eco- nomic outlook and international trade. On this point, a number of participants observed that policy authorities in many foreign countries had only lim- ited policy space to support aggregate demand should the downside risks to global economic growth be realized.  Third, there were concerns about the outlook for in- flation. A number of participants observed that overall inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, as had inflation for items other than food and energy. Several of these participants commented that the fact that wage pres- sures had remained only moderate despite the low unemployment rate could be a sign that the longer- run normal level of the unemployment rate is appre- ciably lower than often assumed. Participants dis- cussed indicators for longer-term inflation expecta- tions and inflation compensation. A number of them concluded that the modest increase in market- based measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period likely reflected market partici- pants’ expectation of more accommodative mone- tary policy in the near future; others observed that, _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019Page 11 while survey measures of inflation expectations were little changed from June, the level of expectations by at least some measures was low. Most participants judged that long-term inflation expectations either were already below the Committee’s 2 percent goal or could decline below the level consistent with that goal should there be a continuation of the pattern of inflation coming in persistently below 2 percent. A couple of participants indicated that they would have preferred a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meeting rather than a 25 basis point reduction. They favored a stronger action to better address the stub- bornly low inflation rates of the past several years, rec- ognizing that the apparent low sensitivity of inflation to levels of resource utilization meant that a notably stronger real economy might be required to speed the return of inflation to the Committee’s inflation objec- tive. Several participants favored maintaining the same target range at this meeting, judging that the real economy con- tinued to be in a good place, bolstered by confident con- sumers, a strong job market, and a low rate of unemploy- ment. These participants acknowledged that there were lingering risks and uncertainties about the global econ- omy in general, and about international trade in particu- lar, but they viewed those risks as having diminished over the intermeeting period. In addition, they viewed the news on inflation over the intermeeting period as consistent with their forecasts that inflation would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective at an accepta- ble pace without an adjustment in policy at this meeting. Finally, a few participants expressed concerns that fur- ther monetary accommodation presented a risk to finan- cial stability in certain sectors of the economy or that a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting could be misinterpreted as a negative signal about the state of the economy. Participants also discussed the timing of ending the re- duction in the Committee’s aggregate securities holdings in the SOMA. Ending the reduction of securities hold- ings in August had the advantage of avoiding the appear- ance of inconsistency in continuing to allow the balance sheet to run off while simultaneously lowering the target range for the federal funds rate. But ending balance sheet reduction earlier than under its previous plan posed some risk of fostering the erroneous impression that the Committee viewed the balance sheet as an active tool of policy. Because the proposed change would end the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings only two months earlier than previously indicated, policymak- ers concluded that there were only small differences be- tween the two options in their implications for the bal- ance sheet and thus also in their economic effects. In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally favored an approach in which policy would be guided by incoming information and its implications for the economic out- look and that avoided any appearance of following a pre- set course. Most participants viewed a proposed quar- ter-point policy easing at this meeting as part of a recali- bration of the stance of policy, or mid-cycle adjustment, in response to the evolution of the economic outlook over recent months. A number of participants suggested that the nature of many of the risks they judged to be weighing on the economy, and the absence of clarity re- garding when those risks might be resolved, highlighted the need for policymakers to remain flexible and focused on the implications of incoming data for the outlook. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that while there had been some im- provement in economic conditions over the intermeet- ing period and the overall outlook remained favorable, significant risks and uncertainties attending the outlook remained. In particular, sluggish U.S. business fixed in- vestment spending and manufacturing output had lin- gered, suggesting that risks and uncertainties associated with weak global economic growth and in international trade were weighing on the domestic economy. Strong labor markets and rising incomes continued to support the outlook for consumer spending, but modest growth in prices and wages suggested that inflation pressures re- mained muted. Inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent symmetric objective. Market- based measures of inflation compensation moved up modestly from the low levels recorded in June, but a por- tion of this change likely reflected the expectation by market participants of additional near-term monetary ac- commodation. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. On this basis, all but two members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent at this meeting. With this adjustment to policy, those members who voted for the policy action sought to better position the overall stance of policy to help counter the effects on the outlook of weak global growth and trade policy uncer- tainty, insure against any further downside risks from those sources, and promote a faster return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective than Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ would otherwise be the case. Those members noted that the action taken at this meeting should be viewed as part of an ongoing reassessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate that began in late 2018. Two mem- bers preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate. In explaining their policy views, those members noted that economic data collected over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee’s 2 percent target. One member also noted that a further easing in policy at a time when the economy is very strong and asset prices are elevated could have adverse implications for financial stability. Members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment and symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objectives. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members generally agreed that it was important to main- tain optionality in setting the future target range for the federal funds rate and, more generally, that near-term ad- justments of the stance of monetary policy would appro- priately remain dependent on the implications of incom- ing information for the economic outlook. With regard to the postmeeting statement, the Commit- tee implemented several adjustments in the description of the economic situation, including a revision to recog- nize that market-based measures of inflation compensa- tion “remain low.” The Committee stated that the re- duction in the target range for the federal funds rate sup- ported its view that “sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective” re- mained the most likely outcomes, but “uncertainties about this outlook remain.” The phrase “as the Com- mittee contemplates the future path” of the target range for the federal funds rate was added to underscore the Committee’s intention to carefully assess incoming in- formation before deciding on future policy adjustments. The statement noted that the Committee would “con- tinue to monitor the implications of incoming infor- mation for the economic outlook” and would “act as ap- propriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objec- tive.” Finally, the Committee announced the conclusion of the reduction of securities holdings in the SOMA. Ending the runoff of securities holdings two months earlier than initially planned was seen as having only very small effects on the balance sheet, with negligible impli- cations for the economic outlook, and was helpful in simplifying communications regarding the usage of the Committee’s policy tools. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective August 1, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to 2¼ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol- iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer- ing rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-coun- terparty limit of $30 billion per day. Effective August 1, 2019, the Committee di- rects the Desk to roll over at auction all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the ma- turity composition of Treasury securities out- in excess of standing; principal payments $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 30–31, 2019Page 13 The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that eco- nomic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic out- look as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent. This action supports the Committee’s view that sus- tained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor- mation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its sym- metric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its 7 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Philadelphia, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2.75 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of August 1, 2019, and the date such Re- serve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments. The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Wil- liams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: Esther L. George and Eric Rosengren. President George dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on the incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term. Recognizing risks to the outlook from the crosscurrents emanating from trade policy un- certainty and weaker global activity, President George would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point to a materially weaker outlook for the economy. President Rosengren dissented because he did not see a clear and compelling case for additional accommodation at this time given that the unemployment rate stood near 50-year lows, inflation seemed likely to rise toward the Committee’s 2 percent target, and financial stability con- cerns were elevated, as indicated by near-record equity prices and corporate leverage. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ per- cent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess re- serve balances to 2.10 percent and voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 2.75 percent, effective August 1, 2019.7 Banks of Boston, New York, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City were informed of the Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2.75 percent, effective August 1, 2019.) A sec- ond vote of the Board encompassed approval of the establish- ment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates. Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Reinvestment Plans The manager pro tem described the Desk’s plans for re- investments in light of the Committee’s decision to con- clude the reduction of aggregate securities holdings in the SOMA portfolio effective August 1. In accordance with the directive to the Desk, beginning on August 1, all principal payments from Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS will be reinvested. Principal pay- ments from Treasury securities held in the SOMA port- folio will be reinvested through rollovers in Treasury auctions. The Desk also will reinvest principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS securities of up to $20 billion per month in Treasury securities in a manner that roughly matches the maturity composition of Treas- ury securities outstanding. The Desk plans to purchase these Treasury securities in the secondary market across 11 sectors of different maturities and security types ap- proximately in proportion to the 12-month average of the amount outstanding in each sector relative to the to- tal amount outstanding across sectors, as measured at the end of July. The Desk will continue to reinvest agency debt and agency MBS principal payments in ex- cess of $20 billion per month in agency MBS. Given the Committee’s decision to bring forward the timing of these purchases to August, the Desk planned to release an operational statement to provide more details on the plans for reinvestment operations. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 17– 18, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 11:15 a.m. on July 31, 2019.

Staff briefings provided an assessment of the risk that the federal funds rate could, in some future downturn, be constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) and discussed options for mitigating the costs as- sociated with this constraint. The staff’s analysis sug- gested that the ELB would likely bind in most future re- cessions, which could make it more difficult for the FOMC to achieve its longer-run objectives of maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation. The staff discussed several options for mitigating ELB risks, including using forward guidance and balance sheet pol- icies earlier and more aggressively than in the past. 4 Attended the discussion of developments in financial mar- kets and open market operations. 5 Attended Tuesday’s session only. 6 Attended the discussion of the review of the monetary policy framework through the end of the meeting. 7 Attended opening remarks for Tuesday session only. Page 3 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The staff also illustrated the properties of “makeup” strategies using model simulations. Under such strate- gies, policymakers would promise to make up for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy that is intended to generate higher future inflation. These strategies are designed to provide ac- commodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate low for an extended period in order to support an economic recovery. Because of their properties both at and away from the ELB, makeup strategies may also more firmly anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent than a policy strategy that does not compensate for past inflation misses. The staff analysis emphasized, however, that the benefits of makeup strategies depend importantly on the private sector’s understanding of these strategies and their confidence that future policymakers would follow through on promises to keep policy accommodative. Participants generally agreed with the staff’s analysis that the risk of future ELB episodes had likely increased over time, and that future ELB episodes and the reduced ef- fect of resource utilization on inflation could inhibit the Committee’s ability to achieve its employment and infla- tion objectives. The increased ELB risk was attributed in part to structural changes in the U.S. economy that had lowered the longer-run real short-term interest rate and thus the neutral level of the policy rate. In this con- text, a couple of participants noted that uncertainty about the neutral rate made it especially challenging to determine any appropriate changes to the current frame- work. In light of a low neutral rate and shortfalls of in- flation below the 2 percent objective for several years, some participants raised the concern that the policy space to reduce the federal funds rate in response to fu- ture recessions could be compressed further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation ex- pectations, a risk that was also discussed in the staff anal- ysis. These participants pointed to long, ongoing ELB spells in other major foreign economies and suggested that, to avoid similar circumstances in the United States, it was important to be aggressive when confronted with forces holding inflation below objective. A couple of participants judged that the lack of monetary policy space abroad and the possibility that fiscal space in the United States might be limited reinforced the case for strengthening the FOMC’s monetary policy framework as a matter of prudent planning. With regard to the current monetary policy framework, participants agreed that this framework served the Com- mittee well in the aftermath of the financial crisis. A number of participants noted that the Committee’s ex- perience with forward guidance and balance sheet poli- cies would likely allow the Committee to deploy these tools earlier and more aggressively in the event that they were needed. A few indicated that the uncertainty about the effectiveness of these policies was smaller than the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of a makeup strategy. Participants generally agreed that the current framework also served the Committee well by providing a strong commitment to achieving the Committee’s maximum- employment and symmetric inflation objectives. Such a commitment was seen as flexible enough to allow the Committee to choose policy actions that best support its objectives in a wide array of economic circumstances. Because of the downside risk to inflation and employ- ment associated with the ELB, most participants were open to the possibility that the dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices could be best served by strategies that deliver inflation rates that over time are, on average, equal to the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent. Promoting such out- comes may require aiming for inflation somewhat above 2 percent when the policy rate was away from the ELB, recognizing that inflation would tend to be lower than 2 percent when the policy rate was constrained by the ELB. Participants suggested several alternatives for do- ing so, including strategies that make up for past infla- tion shortfalls and those that respond more aggressively to below-target inflation than to above-target inflation. In this context, several participants suggested that the adoption of a target range for inflation could be helpful in achieving the Committee’s objective of 2 percent in- flation, on average, as it could help communicate to the public that periods in which the Committee judged in- flation to be moderately away from its 2 percent objec- tive were appropriate. A couple of participants sug- gested analyzing policies in which there was a target range for inflation whose midpoint was modestly higher than 2 percent or in which 2 percent was an inflation floor; these policies might enhance policymakers’ scope to provide accommodation as appropriate when the neutral real interest rate was low. Although ensuring inflation outcomes averaging 2 per- cent over time was seen as important, many participants noted that the illustrated makeup strategies delivered only modest benefits in the staff’s model simulations. These modest benefits in part reflected that the respon- siveness of inflation to resource slack had diminished, making it more difficult to provide sufficient accommo- dation to push inflation back to the Committee’s objec- tive in a timely manner. Some participants suggested Page 4 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ that the modest effects were particularly pronounced us- ing the FRB/US model and indicated the need for more robustness analysis of simulation results along several di- mensions and for further comparison to other alterna- tive strategies. In addition, several participants noted that the implementation of the makeup strategies in the form of either average inflation targeting or price-level targeting in the simulations was tied too rigidly to the details of particular rules. An advantage of the current framework over such alternative approaches is that it has provided the Committee with the flexibility to assess a broad range of factors and information in choosing its policy actions, and these actions can vary depending on economic circumstances in order to best achieve the Committee’s dual mandate. Similarly, makeup strategies could be implemented more flexibly in order to deliver more accommodation during a future downturn and through the subsequent recovery than what could be achieved with a mechanical makeup rule. Participants also discussed a number of challenges asso- ciated with makeup strategies. Many participants ex- pressed reservations with the makeup strategies analyzed by the staff. Some participants raised the concern that the effective use of the makeup strategies in the form of the average inflation targeting and price-level targeting rules that the staff presented depended on future policy- makers following through on commitments to keep pol- icy accommodative for a long time. Such commitments might be difficult for future policymakers to follow through on, especially in situations in which the labor market was strong and inflation was above target. A few participants acknowledged that credibly committing to makeup strategies posed challenges. However, they pointed to the commitments that central banks around the world made to inflation targeting as examples in which similar challenges had been overcome. A couple of participants raised the concern that keeping policy rates low for a long time could lead to excessive risk- taking in financial markets and threaten financial stabil- ity. However, a couple of other participants judged that macroprudential tools could be used to help ensure that any overleveraging of households and firms did not threaten the financial system, while monetary policy needed to be focused on achieving maximum employ- ment and symmetric 2 percent inflation. A few partici- pants viewed the communication challenges associated with average-inflation targeting strategies, including the difficulty of conveying the dangers of low inflation to the public, as greater than for some other strategies that use threshold-based forward guidance. Several partici- pants noted that makeup strategies could unduly limit the policy response in situations in which inflation had been running above 2 percent amid signs of an impend- ing economic downturn. Accordingly, these participants favored makeup strategies that only reversed past infla- tion shortfalls relative to makeup strategies that reversed both past inflation shortfalls and past overruns. Participants continued to discuss the benefits of the Committee’s review of the monetary policy framework as well as the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which articulates the Committee’s approach to monetary policy. As they did at their meeting in July, participants mentioned sev- eral issues that this statement might possibly address. These issues included the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of the ELB constraint, the role of inflation expectations in the Committee’s pursuit of its inflation goal, the best means of conveying the Committee’s bal- anced approach to monetary policy, the symmetry of its inflation goal, and the time frame over which the Com- mittee aimed to achieve it. Participants expected that they would continue their deliberations on these and other topics pertinent to the review at upcoming meet- ings. They also generally agreed that the Committee’s consideration of possible modifications to its policy strategy, tools, and communication practices would take some time, and that the process would be careful, delib- erate, and patient. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager pro tem first discussed developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period. Global financial markets were volatile over the inter- meeting period, with market participants reacting to in- coming information about U.S.–China trade tensions and the global growth outlook. In the weeks following the July FOMC meeting, U.S. yields declined sharply and risk asset prices fell amid a spate of largely negative news about risks to the global economic outlook. These price moves reversed to some degree in September as devel- opments on trade and economic data turned more posi- tive. On net, Treasury yields remained substantially lower, while the S&P 500 and corporate credit spreads reversed most or all of their earlier losses to end the pe- riod little changed. Even after the partial rebound in September, market- and survey-based indicators of policy rate expectations suggested that investors viewed it as very likely that the Committee would ease policy further at this meeting. All respondents from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants viewed a 25 basis Page 5 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ point decrease in the target range as the most likely out- come at this meeting. Looking beyond September, most survey respondents expected another 25 basis point cut by year-end. Further out, while the median of respond- ents’ modal forecasts for the end of 2020 pointed to no rate cuts next year, individual forecasts were much more dispersed, with nearly half of respondents expecting at least one additional 25 basis point cut in 2020, and about one-fourth expecting two or more cuts. Market partici- pants remained attentive to a range of global risk factors that could affect the policy rate path, including trade ten- sions between the United States and China, develop- ments in Europe, political tensions in Hong Kong, un- certainties related to Brexit, and escalating geopolitical tension in the Middle East following attacks on Saudi oil facilities. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money market conditions. Money markets were stable over most of the period, and the reduction in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate following the July FOMC meeting fully passed through to money market rates. However, money markets became highly volatile just before the September meeting, apparently spurred partly by large corporate tax payments and Treasury set- tlements, and remained so through the time of the meet- ing. In an environment of greater perceived uncertainty about potential outflows related to the corporate tax payment date, typical lenders in money markets were less willing to accommodate increased dealer demand for funding. Moreover, some banks maintained reserve lev- els significantly above those reported in the Senior Fi- nancial Officer Survey about their lowest comfortable level of reserves rather than lend in repo markets. Money market mutual funds reportedly also held back some liquidity in order to cushion against potential out- flows. Rates on overnight Treasury repurchase agree- ments rose to over 5 percent on September 16 and above 8 percent on September 17. Highly elevated repo rates passed through to rates in un- secured markets. Federal Home Loan Banks reportedly scaled back their lending in the federal funds market in order to maintain some liquidity in anticipation of higher demand for advances from their members and to shift more of their overnight funding into repo. In this envi- ronment, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) rose to the top of the target range on September 16. The fol- lowing morning, in accordance with the FOMC’s di- rective to the Desk to foster conditions to maintain the EFFR in the target range, the Desk conducted overnight repurchase operations for up to $75 billion. After the operation, rates in secured and unsecured markets de- clined sharply. Rates in secured markets were trading around 2.5 percent after the operation. Market partici- pants reportedly expected that additional temporary open market operations would be necessary both over subsequent days and around the end of the quarter. Many also reportedly expected another 5 basis point technical adjustment of the IOER rate. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the September 17–18 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) ap- peared to be increasing at a moderate rate in the third quarter. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in July. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August, although at a slower rate than in the first half of the year. (Separately, the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary estimate of the upcoming benchmark revision to payroll employment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020, indicated that the revised pace of average monthly job gains from April 2018 to March 2019 would be notably slower than in the current published data.) The unem- ployment rate remained at 3.7 percent through August, and both the labor force participation rate and the em- ployment-to-population ratio moved up. The unem- ployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics de- clined over July and August, while the rates for whites and Asians increased; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous eco- nomic expansion, though persistent differentials be- tween these rates remained. The average share of work- ers employed part time for economic reasons in July and August continued to be below its level in late 2007. Both the rate of private-sector job openings and the rate of quits moved roughly sideways in June and July and were still at relatively high levels; the four-week moving aver- age of initial claims for unemployment insurance bene- fits through early September was near historically low levels. Total labor compensation per hour in the busi- ness sector increased 4.4 percent over the four quarters Page 6 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ ending in the second quarter, a faster rate than a year earlier. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, the same pace as a year earlier. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in July. This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.6 percent, consumer food price inflation remained be- low core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined. The average monthly change in core PCE prices in re- cent months was faster than earlier this year, suggesting that the soft inflation readings during the earlier period were transitory. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in July. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent. Recent survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. The preliminary September reading from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers dipped after edging up in August, but it remained within its recent range; the measures of longer-run inflation ex- pectations from the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants were little changed. Real consumer expenditures appeared to be rising solidly in the third quarter after expanding strongly in the sec- ond quarter. Real PCE rose briskly in July, while the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to estimate PCE were flat in August and the rate of sales of light motor vehicles only edged up, suggesting some slowing in con- sumer spending growth in the third quarter from its strong second-quarter pace. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including a low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. The preliminary September reading on the Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment picked up a little after weakening notably in August, although the Conference Board survey measure of consumer con- fidence did not show a similar decline in August. Real residential investment seemed to be picking up a little in the third quarter after declining over the previous year and a half. Starts of new single-family homes were higher in July and August than the second-quarter aver- age, and starts of multifamily units rose in August after falling back in July. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good indica- tor of the underlying trend in construction of such homes—was higher in July and August than its second- quarter average. Sales of existing homes rose modestly in July, while new home sales declined following an out- sized increase in June. Real nonresidential private fixed investment looked to be declining further in the third quarter. Nominal ship- ments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft de- creased in July, and forward-looking indicators generally pointed to continued softness in business equipment spending. Orders for nondefense capital goods exclud- ing aircraft increased in June but were still below the level of shipments, most measures of business sentiment deteriorated, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth declined further, and trade policy concerns continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures outside the drilling and mining sector decreased in July, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for struc- tures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to de- cline through mid-September. Industrial production increased modestly, on net, over July and August, but production remained notably lower than at the beginning of the year. Automakers’ assembly schedules indicated that the production of light motor vehicles would be roughly flat in the near term (although the labor strike at General Motors was expected to tem- porarily disrupt vehicle production), while new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing sur- veys and a persistent drag from trade tariffs pointed to- ward continued softness in factory output in coming months. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the second quarter. Federal defense spending over July and August decelerated, and federal hiring of temporary workers for next year’s decennial census was modest in August. State and local government payrolls rose moderately over July and August, and nominal spending by these governments on structures in July was below its second- quarter average. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit remained about unchanged in June before narrowing in July. Ex- ports, which had been soft over most of the past year, declined sharply in June but partially rebounded in July. This pattern was particularly notable in exports of non- aircraft capital goods and consumer goods. Imports also Page 7 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ declined sharply in June and then declined a little further in July. Imports of oil and consumer goods fell in June, while imports of capital goods dropped significantly in July. The BEA estimated that the change in net exports was a drag of about ¾ percentage point on real GDP growth in the second quarter. Foreign economic growth remained subdued in the sec- ond quarter. Growth picked up in Canada as oil produc- tion rebounded, but growth slowed sharply in Europe amid a downturn in manufacturing activity and persis- tent policy-related uncertainty. Growth also slowed in China and India. Recent indicators suggested wide- spread weakness in manufacturing abroad even as ser- vices activity appeared to be holding up relatively well. Foreign inflation rose in the second quarter, pushed up by earlier increases in oil prices as well as by rising food prices in some emerging economies. However, data on foreign core consumer prices showed little sign of un- derlying inflationary pressures abroad. Late in the inter- meeting period, an attack on a key oil facility in Saudi Arabia disrupted Saudi oil production and caused an in- itial spike in prices on near-dated oil futures contracts. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market developments over the intermeeting period were driven by an escalation in international trade tensions, growing concerns about the global economic growth outlook, and the prospect of more policy accom- modation by central banks. Nominal Treasury yields posted very large declines in August as investors reacted to the U.S. Administration’s announcement of addi- tional tariffs on Chinese goods, along with the deprecia- tion of the Chinese renminbi through the perceived threshold of 7 renminbi per U.S. dollar and the associ- ated implications of these actions for the global eco- nomic outlook. Treasury yields partially rebounded fol- lowing better-than-expected incoming economic data in the United States and abroad, a perceived reduction in the probability of a no-deal Brexit, and some positive headlines about trade policy. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate shifted down on net. Broad equity price indexes were down as much as 6 percent in early August but almost fully recovered by the end of the intermeeting period. Spreads on investment-grade cor- porate bonds widened modestly, while those on specu- lative-grade corporate bonds were little changed on net. Financing conditions for businesses and households were largely unaffected by the intermeeting turbulence in financial markets and remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity. Measures of expectations of the near- and medium-term path for the federal funds rate were particularly sensitive to news about U.S.–China trade tensions, while FOMC communications had only modest effects on market- based measures of policy rate expectations. A straight read of the option-implied probability distribution of the federal funds rate suggested that the odds investors at- tached to a 25 basis point reduction in the target range of the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meet- ing increased from about 50 percent at the time of the July FOMC meeting to 90 percent by the end of the in- termeeting period. Respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants as- signed, on average, similarly high odds to a rate decrease at the September FOMC meeting. In addition, market- implied expectations for the federal funds rate at year- end and beyond moved down. A straight read of OIS (overnight index swap) forward rates suggested that in- vestors expected the federal funds rate to decline about 45 basis points by year-end, to a level nearly 10 basis points lower than was expected at the time of the July FOMC meeting, and to decrease an additional roughly 45 basis points by the end of 2020. Nominal Treasury yields decreased, on net, over the in- termeeting period, with longer-term yields falling the most. The spread between 10-year and 3-month Treas- ury yields became a bit more negative, while the spread between 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields turned neg- ative for the first time since 2007 and fluctuated around zero until the September FOMC meeting. Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities declined on net. Broad stock price indexes decreased slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period amid heightened volatility. The escalation of trade tensions between China and the United States weighed on equity prices, but investors’ expectations that major central banks would shift toward more accommodative monetary policies provided some support. Equity prices were also boosted by better-than- anticipated corporate earnings and retail-sector data. Stock prices of firms with high exposure to China un- derperformed the broader market somewhat, as did bank stocks amid downward revisions to banks’ earnings forecasts. Conversely, the stock prices of utilities and real estate firms increased noticeably, reportedly benefit- ing from demand by investors reaching for less cyclical and higher-yielding assets. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and re- mained at the lower end of its historical distribution after retracing a sharp increase in early August. Page 8 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Despite the volatility in many domestic and global finan- cial markets over the intermeeting period, conditions in domestic short-term funding markets remained stable until the Monday before the September FOMC meeting, when flows associated with a combination of corporate tax payments and Treasury coupon securities settle- ments led to significant tightening of conditions, partic- ularly for overnight funding. The EFFR rose to the top of the target range on September 16 and exceeded it by 5 basis points on September 17, after which funding pressures eased somewhat following the Desk’s open market operations. On net, the EFFR averaged 2.14 percent over the current intermeeting period, with the spread to the IOER rate down a bit relative to the previous intermeeting period. Early in the intermeeting period, bond yields in the ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs) plunged and foreign equities declined notably following an increase in U.S.– China trade tensions. Some weakness in foreign eco- nomic data, growing concerns about global growth, and the prospect of more monetary policy accommodation abroad contributed to further declines in yields. Later in the period, AFE yields partially rebounded and foreign equity prices fully recovered on some easing of U.S.– China trade tensions, as well as perceptions of reduced political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and Italy. Financial market reactions were mixed after the Euro- pean Central Bank (ECB) announced a package of policy easing measures, including a rate cut on deposits at the ECB, resumption of its asset purchase program, and more favorable terms for longer-term lending to banks. The dollar appreciated against emerging market curren- cies but was little changed, on balance, against AFE cur- rencies, leaving the broad dollar index slightly higher. Emerging market sovereign bond spreads widened no- tably. The Argentine peso depreciated sharply and Ar- gentine sovereign yields soared following the defeat of the current pro-market president in the primary election and the subsequent announcement of plans for debt re- structuring and the imposition of capital controls. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re- mained accommodative. Overall issuance of corporate bonds was solid in August, driven by resilient invest- ment-grade issuance. While speculative-grade corporate bond issuance was somewhat subdued in August, it was comparable to that seen over the same period in 2018. Growth of commercial and industrial loans at banks ticked up, driven by faster growth at large domestic banks. There were no initial public equity offerings by domestic firms in August amid increased market volatil- ity, but several deals were expected to be completed in the coming months. On balance, the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations weakened slightly, with the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades modestly outpacing that of upgrades in recent months. Credit conditions for both small businesses and munici- palities remained accommodative on balance. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained generally accommodative. Bank CRE loan growth slowed moderately since the second quarter, driven by slower growth in loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties. The volume of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities issuance was slightly weaker in July and August than in the same period last year, though industry ana- lysts reportedly anticipated that issuance would soon pick up in response to recent declines in interest rates. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market eased over the intermeeting period. Residential mort- gage rates declined less than long-term Treasury yields, as the increase in prepayment risk and the rise in implied interest rate volatility reportedly reduced the demand for mortgage-backed securities. Home-purchase origina- tions and refinancing originations both rose. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained generally supportive of growth in consumer spending, although supply conditions continued to be tight for subprime credit card borrowers. Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter overall, with bank credit data pointing to continued growth through July and August. In consumer asset- backed securities markets, issuance was solid, and spreads remained at relatively low levels, though some- what above their post-crisis averages. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was little changed in the near term; real GDP growth was still forecast to be slower in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly attributable to continued soft business investment and a slower increase in govern- ment spending. The projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was a bit weaker than the previ- ous forecast, primarily reflecting the effects of a higher projected path for the foreign exchange value of the dol- lar and a lower trajectory for economic growth abroad, which were partially offset by a lower assumed path for interest rates. Real GDP was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of potential output Page 9 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022. The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate, which was revised down a lit- tle. In addition, the staff revised up its estimate of the level of trend productivity in recent years after incorpo- rating the BEA’s recent annual revisions to the national income and product accounts. Both of these supply-side adjustments led to a somewhat higher projected path for potential output, implying that estimates of current and projected resource utilization were less tight than the staff previously assumed. The staff’s forecast of total PCE price inflation for this year was revised down somewhat, reflecting slightly lower projected paths for consumer food and energy prices, along with a little lower forecast for core PCE prices. The core PCE price inflation forecast for this year was revised down to reflect recent data as well as downward-revised data for earlier in the year from the BEA’s annual revision. Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory; nevertheless, both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run below 2 percent through 2022. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up- side for the unemployment rate. Important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant nega- tive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in busi- ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected. The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the down- side risks to the forecast for economic activity Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in- vestment and exports had weakened. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market- based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation ex- pectations were little changed. Participants generally viewed the baseline economic out- look as positive and indicated that their views of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation had changed little since the July meeting. However, for most participants, that economic outlook was premised on a somewhat more accommodative path for policy than in July. Participants generally had become more concerned about risks associated with trade tensions and adverse developments in the geopolitical and global eco- nomic spheres. In addition, inflation pressures contin- ued to be muted. Many participants expected that real GDP growth would moderate to around its potential rate in the second half of the year. Participants agreed that consumer spending was increasing at a strong pace. They also expected that, in the period ahead, household spending would likely remain on a firm footing, sup- ported by strong labor market conditions, rising in- comes, and accommodative financial conditions. Sev- eral participants indicated that the housing sector was starting to rebound, stimulated by a significant decline in mortgage rates. With regard to the contrast between ro- bust consumption growth and weak investment growth, several participants mentioned that uncertainties in the business outlook and sustained weak investment could eventually lead to slower hiring, which, in turn, could damp the growth of income and consumption. In their discussion of the business sector, participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global out- Page 10 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ look as the main factors weighing on business invest- ment, exports, and manufacturing production. Partici- pants judged that trade uncertainty and global develop- ments would continue to affect firms’ investment spend- ing, and that this uncertainty was discouraging them from investing in their businesses. A couple of partici- pants noted that businesses had the capacity to adjust to ongoing uncertainty concerning trade, and some firms were reconfiguring supply chains and making logistical arrangements as part of contingency planning to mitigate the effects of trade tensions on their businesses. Participants discussed developments in the manufactur- ing and the agricultural sectors of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing production remained lower than at the beginning of the year, and recent indicators suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve materially over the near term. Participants saw the ongoing global slow- down and trade uncertainty as contributing importantly to these declines. A few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those as- sociated with tariffs, weak export demand, and more in- tense financial burdens arising from the increase in car- ryover debt in preceding years. Participants commented on the potential disruption to global oil production aris- ing from the attack on Saudi Arabia’s facilities. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate near his- torical lows and continued solid job gains, on average, in recent months. The labor force participation rate of prime-age individuals, especially of prime-age women, moved up in August, continuing its upward trajectory, and the unemployment rate of African Americans fell to its lowest rate on record. However, a number of partic- ipants noted that, although the labor market was clearly in a strong position, the preliminary benchmark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year when the revisions are incorpo- rated in published data early next year. A few partici- pants observed that it would be important to be vigilant in monitoring incoming data for any sign of softening in labor market conditions. That said, reports from busi- ness contacts in many Districts pointed to continued strong labor demand, with some firms still reporting dif- ficulties finding qualified workers and others broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups. In some Districts, employers were also expand- ing training and provision of nonwage benefits, which could help sustain their expansion of hiring against a background of a very tight national labor market without spurring above-trend aggregate wage growth. Some firms were also reluctant to raise wages because of their limited pricing power, while others thought the wages they were offering were in line with the skill sets of the workers available to fill new positions. Participants gen- erally viewed overall wage growth as broadly consistent with modest average rates of labor productivity growth in recent years and as exerting little upward pressure on inflation. A couple of participants noted that, with in- flationary pressures remaining muted and wage growth moderate even as employment and spending expanded further, they had again adjusted downward their esti- mates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate. In their discussion of inflation developments, partici- pants noted that, despite a recent firming in the incom- ing data, readings on overall and core PCE inflation had continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Furthermore, in light of weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued inflation pressures, some partici- pants continued to view the risks to the outlook for in- flation as weighted to the downside. Some participants, however, saw the recent inflation data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year was transitory. In this connection, several participants noted that recent monthly readings, notably for CPI inflation, seemed broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective of 2 percent, while the trimmed mean measure of PCE in- flation, constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las, remained at 2 percent in July. In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, partici- pants generally agreed that, under appropriate policy, in- flation would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Participants saw inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored, but many par- ticipants observed that market-based measures of infla- tion compensation and some survey measures of con- sumers’ inflation expectations were at historically low levels. Some of these participants further noted that longer-term inflation expectations could be somewhat below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, or that continued weakness in infla- tion could prompt expectations to drift lower. Participants generally judged that downside risks to the outlook for economic activity had increased somewhat since their July meeting, particularly those stemming from trade policy uncertainty and conditions abroad. In addition, although readings on the labor market and the overall economy continued to be strong, a clearer picture Page 11 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ of protracted weakness in investment spending, manu- facturing production, and exports had emerged. Partic- ipants also noted that there continued to be a significant probability of a no-deal Brexit, and that geopolitical ten- sions had increased in Hong Kong and the Middle East. Several participants commented that, in the wake of this increase in downside risk, the weakness in business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring, a development that would likely weigh on consumption and the overall economic outlook. Several participants noted that statistical models designed to gauge the probability of recession, including those based on information from the yield curve, suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had increased notably in recent months. However, a couple of these participants stressed the difficulty of extracting the right signal from these probability models, especially in the current period of unusually low levels of term premiums. With regard to developments in financial markets, par- ticipants noted that longer-term U.S. Treasury rates had been volatile over the intermeeting period but, on net, had registered a sizable decline. Participants observed that a key source of downward pressure on Treasury rates arose from flight-to-safety flows, driven by down- side risks to global growth, escalating trade tensions, and disappointing global data. Low interest rates abroad were also considered an important influence on U.S. longer-term rates. Participants expressed a range of views about the implications of low longer-term Treas- ury rates. Some participants judged that a prolonged in- version of the yield curve could be a matter of concern. Participants also noted that equity prices had exhibited volatility but had been largely flat, on balance, over the intermeeting period. Several participants cited consider- ations that led them to be concerned about financial sta- bility, including low risk spreads and a buildup of corpo- rate debt, corporate stock buybacks financed through low-cost leverage, and the pace of lending in the CRE market. However, several others pointed to signs that the financial system remained resilient. In their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate. In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants pointed to considera- tions related to the economic outlook, risk management, and the need to center inflation and inflation expecta- tions on the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 per- cent. Participants noted that there had been little change in their economic outlook since the July meeting and that incoming data had continued to suggest that the pace of economic expansion was consistent with the mainte- nance of strong labor market conditions. However, a couple of participants pointed out that data revisions an- nounced in recent months implied that the economy had likely entered the year with somewhat less momentum than previously thought. In addition, data received since July had confirmed the weakening in business fixed in- vestment and exports. One risk that the economy faced was that the softness recorded of late in firms’ capital formation, manufacturing, and exporting activities might spread to their hiring decisions, with adverse im- plications for household income and spending. Partici- pants observed that such an eventuality was not embed- ded in their baseline outlook; however, a couple of them indicated that this was partly because they assumed that an appropriate adjustment to the policy rate path would help forestall that eventuality. Several also noted that, because monetary policy actions affected economic ac- tivity with a lag, it was appropriate to provide the requi- site policy accommodation now to support economic ac- tivity over coming quarters. Participants favoring a modest adjustment to the stance of monetary policy at this juncture cited other risks to the economic outlook that further underscored the case for such a move. As their discussion of risks had high- lighted, downside risks had become more pronounced since July: Trade uncertainty had increased, prospects for global growth had become more fragile, and various intermeeting developments had intensified geopolitical risks. Against this background, risk-management con- siderations implied that it would be prudent for the Committee to adopt a somewhat more accommodative stance of policy. In addition, a number of participants suggested that a reduction at this meeting in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely better align the target range with a variety of indicators of the appro- priate policy stance, including those based on estimates of the neutral interest rate. A few participants observed that the considerations favoring easing were reinforced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the ELB. If policymakers provided adequate accommodation while still away from the ELB, this course of action would help forestall the possibility of a prolonged ELB episode. Many participants also cited the level of inflation or in- flation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting. Inflation had generally fallen short of the Committee’s objective Page 12 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ for several years and, notwithstanding some stronger re- cent monthly readings on inflation, the 12-month rate was still below 2 percent. Some estimates of trend infla- tion were also below 2 percent. Several participants ad- ditionally stressed that survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations and market-based measures of in- flation compensation were near historical lows and that these values pointed to the possibility that inflation ex- pectations were below levels consistent with the 2 per- cent objective or could soon fall below such levels. Against this backdrop, participants suggested that a pol- icy easing would help underline policymakers’ commit- ment to the symmetric 2 percent longer-run objective. With inflation pressures muted and U.S. inflation likely being weighed down by global disinflationary forces, policymakers saw little chance of an outsized increase in inflation in response to additional policy accommoda- tion and argued that such an increase, should it occur, could be addressed in a straightforward manner using conventional monetary policy tools. Several participants favored maintaining the existing tar- get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. These participants suggested that the baseline projection for the economy had changed very little since the Com- mittee’s previous meeting and that the state of the econ- omy and the economic outlook did not justify a shift away from the current policy stance, which they felt was already adequately accommodative. They acknowledged the uncertainties that currently figured importantly in evaluations of the economic outlook, but they con- tended that the key uncertainties were unlikely to be re- solved soon. Furthermore, as they did not believe that these uncertainties would derail the expansion, they did not see further policy accommodation as needed at this time. Changes in the stance of policy, they believed, should instead occur only when the macroeconomic data readily justified those moves. In this connection, a couple of participants suggested that, if it decided to pro- vide more policy accommodation at the present junc- ture, the Committee might be taking out too much in- surance against possible future shocks, leaving monetary policy with less scope to boost aggregate demand in the event that such shocks materialized. A few of the par- ticipants favoring an unchanged target range for the fed- eral funds rate also expressed concern that an easing of monetary policy at this meeting could exacerbate finan- cial imbalances. A couple of participants indicated their preference for a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meet- ing. These participants suggested that a larger policy move would help reduce the risk of an economic down- turn and would more appropriately recognize important recent developments, such as slowing job gains, weaken- ing investment, and continued low values of market- based measures of inflation compensation. In addition, these participants stressed the need for a policy stance— possibly one using enhanced forward guidance—that was sufficiently accommodative to make it unlikely that the United States would experience a protracted period of the kind seen abroad in which the economy became mired in a combination of undesirably low inflation, weak economic activity, and near-zero policy rates. They also argued that it was desirable for the Committee to seek and maintain a level of accommodation sufficient to deliver inflation at 2 percent on a sustained basis and that such a policy would be consistent with inflation ex- ceeding 2 percent for a time. With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants agreed that policy was not on a preset course and would depend on the implications of incoming in- formation for the evolution of the economic outlook. A few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater pro- vision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policy- makers’ own expectations for that path. Several partici- pants suggested that the Committee’s postmeeting state- ment should provide more clarity about when the recal- ibration of the level of the policy rate in response to trade uncertainty would likely come to an end. Participants’ Discussion of Recent Money Market Developments The manager pro tem provided a summary of the most recent developments in money markets. Open market operations conducted on the previous day had helped to ease strains in money markets, but the EFFR had none- theless printed 5 basis points above the top of the target range. With significant pressures still evident in repo markets and the federal funds market, and in accordance with the FOMC’s directive to maintain the federal funds rate within the target range, the Desk conducted another repo operation on the morning of the second day of the meeting. The staff presented a proposal to lower the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repurchase agree- ment rate by 5 basis points, relative to the target range for the federal funds rate, in order to foster trading of federal funds within the target range. Page 13 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants agreed that developments in money markets over recent days implied that the Committee should soon discuss the appropriate level of reserve balances sufficient to support efficient and effective implementa- tion of monetary policy in the context of the ample-re- serves regime that the Committee had chosen. A few participants noted the possibility of resuming trend growth of the balance sheet to help stabilize the level of reserves in the banking system. Participants agreed that any Committee decision regarding the trend pace of bal- ance sheet expansion necessary to maintain a level of re- serve balances appropriate to facilitate policy implemen- tation should be clearly distinguished from past large- scale asset purchase programs that were aimed at altering the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings in order to provide monetary policy accommo- dation and ease overall financial conditions. Several par- ticipants suggested that such a discussion could benefit from also considering the merits of introducing a stand- ing repurchase agreement facility as part of the frame- work for implementing monetary policy. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the July meeting indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had been rising at a strong pace. However, business fixed investment and exports had weakened, and this outcome suggested that risks and un- certainty associated with international trade develop- ments and with ongoing weakness in global economic growth were continuing to weigh on the domestic econ- omy. On a 12-month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit- tle changed. In light of these developments, most mem- bers agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent at this meeting. With this adjustment to policy, those members who sup- ported the policy action sought to make the overall stance of monetary policy most consistent with helping to offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade policy uncertainty, insure against fur- ther downside risks arising from those sources and from geopolitical developments, and promote a more rapid return of inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 per- cent objective than would otherwise occur. A couple of these members observed that, because monetary policy actions affected aggregate spending with a lag, the pre- sent meeting was an appropriate occasion for providing accommodation that would support economic activity in the period ahead. Two members preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. These members noted that economic data re- ceived over the intermeeting period had been largely positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor markets and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. These members also suggested that providing further accommodation during a period of high economic activity and elevated asset prices could have adverse consequences for finan- cial stability. One member preferred a reduction in the target range of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting. This member suggested that such a larger rate adjustment would be more consistent with the achievement of the Committee’s objectives over time and, in particular, with helping preclude the possibility of a protracted period in which inflation and employ- ment were below the Committee’s objectives. Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to its maximum- employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objective. They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to update the language of the Committee’s de- scription of incoming data to acknowledge the weaken- ing in investment spending and in U.S. exports, as well as the recent strong rate of increase of household spend- ing. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 19, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1¾ to 2 percent, including overnight Page 14 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re- purchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven- tions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such op- erations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed in- vestment and exports have weakened. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are run- ning below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expec- tations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic out- look as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent. This action supports the Committee’s view that sus- tained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain. As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor- mation for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its sym- metric 2 percent objective. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: James Bullard, Esther L. George, and Eric Rosengren. President Bullard dissented because he believed that lowering the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points at this time would provide insurance against further declines in expected inflation and a slow- ing economy subject to elevated downside risks. In ad- dition, a 50 basis point cut at this time would help pro- mote a more rapid return of inflation and inflation ex- pectations to target. President George dissented be- cause she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term. Recogniz- ing the risks to the outlook from the effects of trade pol- icy and weaker global activity, President George would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point Page 15 Minutes of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ to a materially weaker outlook for the economy. Presi- dent Rosengren dissented because he judged that mon- etary policy was already accommodative. In his view, additional accommodation was not needed for an econ- omy in which labor markets are already tight and could pose risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encouraging households and firms to take on too much leverage. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.80 percent and voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 2.50 percent, effective September 19, 2019. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 29– 30, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 10:40 a.m. on Sep- tember 18, 2019. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on August 20, 2019, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 30–31, 2019. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 1 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 17–18, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on infor- mation available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy— including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer- run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projec- tions represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to con- verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Ap- propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos- ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. Participants who submitted longer-run projections ex- pected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2019 would run slightly or somewhat above their individual estimates of its longer-run rate. Participants expected real GDP growth to edge down over the projection horizon, with all participants project- ing growth in 2022 to be at or modestly below their es- timates of its longer-run rate. Almost all participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that the unemployment rate through 2022 would run below their estimates of its longer-run level. All participants contin- ued to project that total inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase from 2019 to 2020, and many expected another slight increase in 2021. The vast majority of participants ex- pected that inflation would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021 and 2022. The median of participants’ projections for core PCE price inflation increased over the projection period, rising to 2.0 percent in 2021. Table 1 and figure 1 provide sum- mary statistics for the projections. Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. 2019, some participants slightly revised down their esti- mates of the longer-run unemployment rate; the median estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate was un- changed. Participants’ projections for total and core in- flation were generally little changed compared with their projections in June. As shown in figure 2, participants expected that the evo- lution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant a federal funds rate target by the end of this year at or below the target range that the Committee adopted at its July 30–31 meeting. Compared with the June SEP submissions, the median projection for the federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower for the end of 2019 and 25 basis points lower for the end of 2020 and 2021. In the September SEP submissions, the me- dian for the federal funds rate for 2020 was equal to the median for 2019. The median of participants’ assess- ments of the appropriate level for the federal funds rate in 2022 was slightly below the median of participants’ estimates of its longer-run level. Some participants re- vised lower their assessments of the longer-run federal funds rate, but the median assessment of the longer-run federal funds rate was unchanged. Most participants regarded the uncertainties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly similar to the average over the past 20 years. Just over half of the participants viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemployment rate projections as being similar to the average of the past 20 years, while the rest of the participants viewed uncer- tainty as higher. Most participants assessed the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside. Most participants judged the risks to the in- flation outlook as broadly balanced; some participants viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, and no participant assessed risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. Participants’ assessments of the uncer- tainties and risks around their forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate were little changed overall relative to June. The uncertainties around their projections for headline and core inflation were little Page 2 Federal Open Market Committee _____________________________________________________________________________________________ , s t n e d i s e r p k n a B e v r e s e R l a r e d e F d n a s r e b m e m d r a o B e v r e s e R l a r e d e F f o s n o i t c e j o r p c i m o n o c E . 1 e l b a T 9 1 0 2 r e b m e t p e S , y c i l o p y r a t e n o m e t a i r p o r p p a d e t c e j o r p f o s n o i t p m u s s a l a u d i v i d n i r i e h t r e d n u 3 e g n a R 2 y c n e d n e T l a r t n e C 1 n a i d e M 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 9 1 0 2 r e g n o L 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 9 1 0 2 r e g n o L 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 9 1 0 2 e l b a i r a V t n e c r e P r e g n o L n u r 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 5 . 4 – 6 . 3 5 . 4 – 6 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 9 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 8 . 1 7 . 1 – 4 . 1 7 . 1 – 4 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 1 . 2 – 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 8 . 1 8 . 1 – 6 . 1 8 . 1 – 4 . 1 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 1 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 9 . 1 6 . 1 – 5 . 1 6 . 1 – 5 . 1 0 . 2 – 9 . 1 0 . 2 – 9 . 1 8 . 1 – 7 . 1 8 . 1 – 7 . 1 n u r 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 5 . 1 3 . 2 – 7 . 1 3 . 2 – 5 . 1 4 . 2 – 1 . 2 4 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 7 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 1 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 1 . 2 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 2 . 4 – 3 . 3 1 . 4 – 3 . 3 2 . 4 – 3 . 3 0 . 4 – 3 . 3 0 . 4 – 3 . 3 8 . 3 – 5 . 3 8 . 3 – 5 . 3 3 . 4 – 0 . 4 4 . 4 – 0 . 4 0 . 4 – 7 . 3 9 . 3 – 6 . 3 0 . 4 – 6 . 3 8 . 3 – 6 . 3 9 . 3 – 5 . 3 7 . 3 – 6 . 3 7 . 3 – 6 . 3 n u r 9 . 1 9 . 1 2 . 4 2 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 2 8 . 1 9 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 9 . 1 8 . 1 8 . 3 8 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 7 . 3 7 . 3 9 . 1 9 . 1 9 . 1 9 . 1 2 . 2 1 . 2 7 . 3 6 . 3 5 . 1 5 . 1 8 . 1 8 . 1 P D G l a e r n i e g n a h C n o i t c e j o r p e n u J e t a r t n e m y o l p m e n U n o i t c e j o r p e n u J 4 n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P e r o C n o i t c e j o r p e n u J n o i t c e j o r p e n u J n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P h t a p y c i l o p e t a i r p o r p p a d e t c e j o r P : o m e M 3 . 3 – 0 . 2 3 . 3 – 4 . 2 9 . 2 – 6 . 1 6 . 2 – 6 . 1 1 . 3 – 9 . 1 4 . 2 – 6 . 1 1 . 3 – 9 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 6 . 2 – 9 . 1 8 . 2 – 5 . 2 0 . 3 – 5 . 2 6 . 2 – 9 . 1 4 . 2 – 6 . 1 6 . 2 – 9 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 4 . 2 – 9 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 4 . 2 – 9 . 1 5 . 2 5 . 2 4 . 2 1 . 2 4 . 2 9 . 1 1 . 2 9 . 1 4 . 2 n o i t c e j o r p e n u J e t a r s d n u f l a r e d e F h t r u o f e h t m o r f s e g n a h c t n e c r e p e r a n o i t a ﬂ n i f o s e r u s a e m h t o b r o f s n o i t c e j o r p d n a ) P D G ( t c u d o r p c i t s e m o d s s o r g l a e r n i e g n a h c f o s n o i t c e j o r P : e t o N , y l e v i t c e p s e r , n i e g n a h c f o s e t a r e g a t n e c r e p e h t e r a n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P e r o c d n a n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P . d e t a c i d n i r a e y e h t f o r e t r a u q h t r u o f e h t o t r a e y s u o i v e r p e h t f o r e t r a u q e t a r t n e m y o l p m e n u e h t r o f s n o i t c e j o r P . y g r e n e d n a d o o f g n i d u l c x e E C P r o f x e d n i e c i r p e h t d n a ) E C P ( s e r u t i d n e p x e n o i t p m u s n o c l a n o s r e p r o f x e d n i e c i r p f o t n e m s s e s s a r e h r o s i h n o d e s a b e r a s n o i t c e j o r p s ’ t n a p i c i t r a p h c a E . d e t a c i d n i r a e y e h t f o r e t r a u q h t r u o f e h t n i e t a r t n e m y o l p m e n u n a i l i v i c e g a r e v a e h t r o f e h t e r a e g r e v n o c o t d e t c e p x e e b d l u o w e l b a i r a v h c a e h c i h w o t e t a r e h t f o t n e m s s e s s a s ’ t n a p i c i t r a p h c a e t n e s e r p e r s n o i t c e j o r p n u r -

Page 5 Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ changed as well, but more participants saw the inflation risks as broadly balanced than in June. The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemploy- ment As shown in table 1, the median of participants’ projec- tions for the growth rate of real GDP in 2019, condi- tional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.2 percent, a bit above the median estimate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent. Almost all participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow over the projection period, with the median projection at 2.0 percent in 2020, 1.9 percent in 2021, and 1.8 per- cent in 2022. Relative to the June SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth in 2019, 2020, 2021, and the longer run were unchanged or revised slightly higher. The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.7 percent, ½ percentage point below the median assessment of its longer-run level of 4.2 percent. The medians of projections for 2020, 2021, and 2022 were 3.7 percent, 3.8 percent, and 3.9 percent, respectively. The median projected unem- ployment rate for 2019 was slightly higher than in the June SEP, while the median projected unemployment rates for 2020 and 2021 were unchanged relative to the June SEP. A vast majority of participants who submit- ted longer-run projections expected that the unemploy- ment rate in 2022 would be below their estimates of its longer-run level, with some participants projecting a gap of ½ percentage point or more. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate, respectively, from 2019 to 2022 and in the longer run. The distribution of individual projec- tions for real GDP growth for 2019 shifted up some- what relative to that in the June SEP. The distributions of individual projections of real GDP growth for 2020 and 2021 and for the longer run were little changed over- all. The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate for 2019 to 2021 and for the longer run were also little changed overall relative to those in June. The Outlook for Inflation As shown in table 1, the median of projections for total PCE price inflation was 1.5 percent in 2019, 1.9 percent in 2020, and 2.0 percent in 2021; these medians were un- changed from June. For 2022, the median projection for total PCE was 2.0 percent. The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation were 1.8 percent for 2019 and 1.9 percent for 2020. The median projections for core inflation for 2021 and 2022 were 2.0 percent. These medians were also unchanged from June for each year included in the June SEP. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri- butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in- flation. The distributions of projections for total and core PCE price inflation in 2019, 2020, and 2021 were little changed overall relative to those in June. For 2022, all participants projected total and core inflation between 1.8 and 2.2 percent. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg- ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run. Compared with the June projections, the range of pro- jections for 2019, 2020, and 2021 shifted toward lower values and narrowed somewhat. The vast majority of participants viewed the appropriate levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2019, 2020, and 2021 as lower than those that they deemed appropriate in June. All participants lowered their projections for the appropri- ate level of the federal funds rate, relative to June, at some point in the projection period, and none raised their projections for the federal funds rate for any year. Compared with the projections prepared for the June SEP, the median federal funds rate was 50 basis points lower in 2019 and 25 basis points lower in 2020 and 2021. Muted inflation pressures, slower global growth, and weak business fixed investment were cited as rea- sons for downward revisions to the appropriate path for the federal funds rate, as were trade tensions and risk- management considerations. The median federal funds rate projection for the end of 2019 was 1.88 percent. Seven participants assessed that the most likely appropriate federal funds rate at the end of 2019 was 1.63 percent, while five assessed that the most likely appropriate rate at year-end was 2.13 percent. The median for 2020 was 1.88 percent, equal to the me- dian for 2019. For subsequent years, the medians of the projections were 2.13 percent at the end of 2021 and 2.38 percent at the end of 2022. Some participants re- vised lower their estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate, while a majority of participants’ esti- mates were unchanged.

As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are rep- resented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts dis- play the SEP medians for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the degree of un- certainty attending these projections is similar to the typ- ical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 per- cent probability of being within these confidence inter- vals. For all three variables, this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast hori- zon lengthens. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Most participants continued to view the uncertain- ties around their forecasts for GDP growth, total infla- tion, and core inflation as broadly similar to the average over the past 20 years. Just over half of the participants viewed the level of uncertainty around their unemploy- ment rate projections as being similar to the average of the past 20 years, while the rest of the participants viewed uncertainty as higher.2 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Most participants continued to view the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside. Most participants—four more than in the June SEP—judged the risks to the in- flation outlook as broadly balanced; some participants viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the downside, and no participants assessed risks to inflation as weighted to the upside.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, several participants mentioned trade developments, concerns about foreign economic growth, and weaker business fixed investment as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. economic growth outlook. For the inflation outlook, the possibil- ity that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective and the potential for weaker domestic demand to put downward pressure on inflation were viewed as downside risks. A few participants noted the possibility that higher tariffs could lead to aggregate price pressure as a source of upside risk to inflation. A number of par- ticipants mentioned that their assessments of risks re- mained roughly balanced, in part because the downward revisions to their appropriate path for the federal funds rate were offsetting factors that would otherwise con- tribute to asymmetric risks. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the federal 2 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

Figure 5 provides a graphic represen- tation of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence inter- vals derived from the results presented in table 2.3 As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncer- tainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and increases for longer hori- zons. 3 The confidence interval for the federal funds rate is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero, which is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Page 17 Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 17–18, 2019 _____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.8 to 4.2 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the fourth year. The corre- sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla- tion would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unem- ployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; fur- thermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices Committee participants continued their discussions re- lated to the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Staff briefings provided an assessment of a range of monetary policy tools that the Committee could employ to provide additional economic stimulus and bolster inflation outcomes, particularly in future epi- sodes in which the policy rate would be constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB). The staff first dis- cussed policy rate tools, focusing on three forms of for- ward guidance—qualitative, which provides a nonspe- cific indication of the expected duration of accommoda- tion; date-based, which specifies a date beyond which accommodation could start to be reduced; and outcome- based, which ties the possible start of a reduction of ac- commodation to the achievement of certain macroeco- nomic outcomes. The briefing addressed communica- tions challenges associated with each form of forward guidance, including the need to avoid conveying a more negative economic outlook than the FOMC expects. Nonetheless, the staff suggested that forward guidance generally had been effective in easing financial condi- tions and stimulating economic activity in circumstances when the policy rate was above the ELB and when it was at the ELB. The briefing also discussed negative interest rates, a policy option implemented by several foreign central banks. The staff noted that although the evi- dence so far suggested that this tool had provided ac- commodation in jurisdictions where it had been em- ployed, there were also indications of possible adverse side effects. Moreover, differences between the U.S. fi- nancial system and the financial systems of those juris- dictions suggested that the foreign experience may not provide a useful guide in assessing whether negative rates would be effective in the United States. The second part of the staff briefing focused on balance sheet policy tools. The staff discussed the benefits and costs associated with the large-scale asset purchase pro- grams implemented by the Federal Reserve after the fi- nancial crisis. In general, the staff’s review of the histor- ical experience suggested that the benefits of large-scale asset purchase programs were significant and that many of the potential costs of such programs identified at the time either did not materialize or materialized to a smaller degree than initially feared. In addition, the staff presentation noted that—taking account of investor ex- pectations ahead of the announcement of each new pro- gram—the effects of asset purchases did not appear to have diminished materially across consecutive programs. However, going forward, such policies might not be as effective because longer-term interest rates would likely be much lower at the onset of a future asset purchase program than they were before the financial crisis. The staff also compared the benefits and costs associated with asset purchase programs that are of a fixed cumu- lative size and those that are flow-based—where pur- chases continue at a specific pace until certain macroe- conomic outcomes are achieved—and examined the po- tential effectiveness of using asset purchases to place ceilings on interest rates. The briefing also discussed lending programs that could facilitate the flow of credit to households or businesses. Participants discussed the relative merits of qualitative, date-based, and outcome-based forward guidance. A number of participants noted that each of these three forms of forward guidance could be effective in provid- ing accommodation, depending on circumstances both at and away from the ELB. They also suggested that different types of forward guidance would likely be needed to address varying economic conditions, and that the communications regarding forward guidance needed to be tailored to explain the Committee’s evaluation of the economic outlook. In particular, several participants emphasized that to guard against the possibility of ad- verse feedback loops in which forward guidance is inter- preted by the public as a sign of a sharply deteriorating economic outlook, thus leading households and busi- nesses to become even more cautious in their spending decisions, the Committee would need to clearly com- municate how its announced policy could help promote better economic outcomes. Participants saw both ben- efits and costs associated with outcome-based forward guidance relative to other forms of forward guidance. On the one hand, relative to qualitative or date-based forward guidance, outcome-based forward guidance has the advantage of creating an explicit link between future monetary policy actions and macroeconomic conditions, thereby helping to support economic stabilization ef- forts and foster transparency and accountability. On the other hand, outcome-based forward guidance could be complex and difficult to explain and, hence, could po- tentially be less effective than qualitative or date-based forward guidance if those hurdles could not be over- come. A few participants commented that outcome- based forward guidance, tied to inflation outcomes, could be a useful tool to reinforce the Committee’s com- mitment to its symmetric 2 percent objective. Participants also discussed the benefits and costs of us- ing different types of balance sheet policy. Participants _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 3 generally agreed that the balance sheet policies imple- mented by the Federal Reserve after the crisis had eased financial conditions and had contributed to the eco- nomic recovery, and that those tools had become an im- portant part of the Committee’s current toolkit. How- ever, some participants pointed out that research had produced a sizable range of estimates of the magnitude of the economic effects of balance sheet actions. In ad- dition, some participants noted that the effectiveness of these tools might be diminished in the future, as longer- term interest rates have declined to very low levels and would likely be even lower following an adverse shock that could lead to the resumption of large-scale asset purchases; as a result, there might be limited scope for balance sheet tools to provide accommodation. Several participants commented on the advantages and disad- vantages of flow-based asset purchase programs tied to the achievement of economic outcomes. On the one hand, such programs adjusted automatically in response to the performance of the economy and, hence, were more straightforward to implement and communicate. On the other hand, flow-based asset purchase programs may result in the balance sheet rising to undesirable lev- els. A few participants also commented that, barring sig- nificant dislocations to particular segments of the mar- kets, they would restrict asset purchases to Treasury se- curities to avoid perceptions that the Federal Reserve was engaging in credit allocation across sectors of the economy. In considering policy tools that the Federal Reserve had not used in the recent past, participants discussed the benefits and costs of using balance sheet tools to cap rates on short- or long-maturity Treasury securities through open market operations as necessary. A few participants saw benefits to capping longer-term interest rates that more directly influence household and busi- ness spending. In addition, capping longer-maturity in- terest rates using balance sheet tools, if judged as credi- ble by market participants, might require a smaller amount of asset purchases to provide a similar amount of accommodation as a quantity-based program pur- chasing longer-maturity securities. However, many par- ticipants raised concerns about capping long-term rates. Some of those participants noted that uncertainty re- garding the neutral federal funds rate and regarding the effects of rate ceiling policies on future interest rates and inflation made it difficult to determine the appropriate level of the rate ceiling or when that ceiling should be removed; that maintaining a rate ceiling could result in an elevated level of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet or significant volatility in its size or maturity composi- tion; or that managing longer-term interest rates might be seen as interacting with the federal debt management process. By contrast, a majority of participants saw greater benefits in using balance sheet tools to cap shorter-term interest rates and reinforce forward guid- ance about the near-term path of the policy rate. All participants judged that negative interest rates cur- rently did not appear to be an attractive monetary policy tool in the United States. Participants commented that there was limited scope to bring the policy rate into neg- ative territory, that the evidence on the beneficial effects of negative interest rates abroad was mixed, and that it was unclear what effects negative rates might have on the willingness of financial intermediaries to lend and on the spending plans of households and businesses. Par- ticipants noted that negative interest rates would entail risks of introducing significant complexity or distortions to the financial system. In particular, some participants cautioned that the financial system in the United States is considerably different from those in countries that im- plemented negative interest rate policies, and that nega- tive rates could have more significant adverse effects on market functioning and financial stability here than abroad. Notwithstanding these considerations, partici- pants did not rule out the possibility that circumstances could arise in which it might be appropriate to reassess the potential role of negative interest rates as a policy tool. Overall, participants generally agreed that the forward guidance and balance sheet policies followed by the Fed- eral Reserve after the financial crisis had been effective in providing stimulus at the ELB. With estimates of equilibrium real interest rates having declined notably over recent decades, policymakers saw less room to re- duce the federal funds rate to support the economy in the event of a downturn. In addition, against a back- ground of inflation undershooting the symmetric 2 per- cent objective for several years, some participants raised the concern that the scope to reduce the federal funds rate to provide support to economic activity in future recessions could be reduced further if inflation shortfalls continued and led to a decline in inflation expectations. Therefore, participants generally agreed it was important for the Committee to keep a wide range of tools available and employ them as appropriate to support the econ- omy. Doing so would help ensure the anchoring of in- flation expectations at a level consistent with the Com- mittee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Some participants noted that the form of the policy re- sponse would depend critically on the circumstances the Committee faced at the time. Several participants sug- gested that communicating to the public clearly and con- vincingly in advance about how the Committee intended to provide accommodation at the ELB would enhance public confidence and support the effectiveness of whichever tool the Committee selected. Some partici- pants thought it would be helpful for the Committee to evaluate how its tools could be utilized in different eco- nomic scenarios, such as when longer-term interest rates were significantly below current levels, and discuss which actions would best address the challenges posed by each scenario. Several participants noted that, partic- ularly if monetary policy became severely constrained at the ELB, expansionary fiscal policy would be especially important in addressing an economic downturn. Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s review of the monetary policy framework as well as the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Mon- etary Policy Strategy. They also generally agreed that the Committee’s consideration of possible modifications to its policy strategy, tools, and communication practices would take some time and that the process would be careful, deliberate, and patient. A number of partici- pants judged that the review could be completed around the middle of 2020. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager pro tem first reviewed developments in fi- nancial markets over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, market participants focused on signs of weakness in U.S. economic data with some soft data from business surveys viewed as substantiating concerns that global headwinds were spilling over to the U.S. economy. Later in the period, markets responded to news suggesting favorable developments around Brexit and a partial U.S.-China trade deal. On balance, U.S. fi- nancial conditions ended the period little changed. Regarding the outlook for U.S. monetary policy, the Open Market Desk’s surveys and market-based indica- tors pointed to a high likelihood of a 25 basis point cut in the target range at the October meeting. The proba- bility that survey respondents placed on this outcome was broadly similar to the probability of a 25 basis point cut ahead of the July and September meetings. Further ahead, the path implied by the medians of survey re- spondents’ modal forecasts for the federal funds rate re- mained essentially flat after this meeting. Meanwhile, the market-implied path suggested that investors expected around 25 basis points of additional easing by the end of 2020, after the anticipated easing at this meeting. The manager pro tem next turned to a review of money market developments since early October. On Octo- ber 11, the Committee announced its decision to main- tain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early September through a program of Treasury bill purchases and repurchase agreement (repo) operations. After the announcement, the Desk conducted regular operations that offered at least $75 billion in overnight repo funding and between $135 and $170 billion in term funding. These operations fostered conditions that helped main- tain the federal funds rate within the target range through two channels. First, they provided funding in repo markets that dampened repo market pressure that would otherwise have passed through to the federal funds market, and second, they increased the supply of reserves in the banking system. In anticipation of an- other projected sharp decline in reserves and expected rate pressures around October 31, the Desk announced an increase in the size of overnight repos to $120 billion, and an increase in the size of the two term repo opera- tions that crossed the October month-end to $45 billion. With respect to purchases of Treasury bills for reserve management purposes, the Desk had purchased more than half of the initial $60 billion monthly amount for October, and propositions at the five operations con- ducted to date had been strong. Respondents to the Desk surveys expected reserve management purchases of Treasury bills to continue at the same pace for some time. The combination of repo operations and bill pur- chases lifted reserve levels above those observed in early September. The manager pro tem noted that diminished willingness of some dealers to intermediate across money markets ahead of the year-end could result in upward pressure on short-term money market rates. Forward measures of market pricing continued to indicate expectations for such pressures around the year-end. The Desk planned to continue its close monitoring of reserves and money market conditions, as well as dealer participation in repo operations, particularly given balance sheet constraints heading into year-end. The Desk discussed its intentions to further adjust operations around year-end as needed to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation, and to maintain over time a level of reserve balances at or above those that prevailed in early September. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 5 The manager pro tem finished by noting that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would soon release a request for public comment on a plan to publish a series of back- ward looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) averages and a daily SOFR index to support the transi- tion away from instruments based on LIBOR (London interbank offered rate). Publication of these series was expected to begin in the first half of 2020. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Review of Options for Repo Operations to Support Control of the Federal Funds Rate The staff briefed participants on the recent experience with using repo operations to support control of the fed- eral funds rate and on possibly maintaining a role for repo operations in the monetary policy implementation framework over the longer run. Ongoing capacity for repo operations could be viewed as useful in an ample- reserves regime as a way of providing insurance against unexpected stresses in money markets that could drive the federal funds rate outside the Committee’s target range over a sustained period. The staff presented two potential approaches for conducting repo operations if the Committee decided to maintain an ongoing role for such operations. Under the first approach, the Desk would conduct modestly sized, relatively frequent repo operations designed to provide a high degree of readi- ness should the need for larger operations arise; under the second approach, the FOMC would establish a standing fixed-rate facility that could serve as an auto- matic money market stabilizer.8 Assessing these two ap- proaches involved several considerations, including the degree of assurance of control over the federal funds rate, the likelihood that participation in the Federal Re- serve’s repo operations could become stigmatized, the possibility that the operations could encourage the Fed- eral Reserve’s counterparties to take on excessive liquid- ity risks in their portfolios, and the potential disinterme- diation of financial transactions currently undertaken by private counterparties. Regular, modestly sized repo op- erations likely would pose relatively little risk of stigma or moral hazard, but they may provide less assurance of control over the federal funds rate because it might be difficult for the Federal Reserve to anticipate money 8 The staff briefed the Committee in June 2019 on the possible role of a standing repo facility in the monetary policy imple- mentation framework. market pressures and scale up its repo operations ac- cordingly. A standing fixed-rate repo facility would likely provide substantial assurance of control over the federal funds rate, but use of the facility could become stigmatized, particularly if the rate was set at a relatively high level. Conversely, a standing facility with a rate set at a relatively low level could result in larger and more frequent repo operations than would be appropriate. And by effectively standing ready to provide a form of liquidity on an as-needed basis, such a facility could in- crease the risk that some institutions may take on an un- desirably high amount of liquidity risk. In their comments following the staff presentation, par- ticipants emphasized the importance of maintaining re- serves at a level consistent with the Committee’s choice of an ample-reserves monetary policy implementation framework, in which control over the level of the federal funds rate is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not re- quired. Some participants indicated that, in such an en- vironment, they would have some tolerance for allowing the federal funds rate to vary from day to day and to move occasionally outside its target range, especially in those instances associated with easily identifiable tech- nical events; a couple of participants expressed discom- fort with such misses. Participants expressed a range of views on the relative merits of the two approaches described by the staff for conducting repo operations. Many participants noted that, once an ample supply of reserves is firmly estab- lished, there might be little need for a standing repo fa- cility or for frequent repo operations. Some of these participants indicated that a basic principle in imple- menting an ample-reserves framework is to maintain re- serves on an ongoing basis at levels that would obviate the need for open market operations to address pres- sures in funding markets in all but exceptional circum- stances. Many participants remarked, however, that even in an environment with ample reserves, a standing facility could serve as a useful backstop to support con- trol of the federal funds rate in the event of outsized shocks to the system. Several of these participants also suggested that, if a standing facility were created that al- lowed banks to monetize a portion of their securities holdings at times of market stress, banks could possibly reduce their demand for reserves in normal times, which Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ could make it feasible for the monetary policy imple- mentation framework to operate with a significantly smaller quantity of reserves than would otherwise be needed. A couple of participants pointed out that estab- lishing a standing facility would be similar to the practice of some other major central banks. A number of partic- ipants noted that, before deciding whether to implement a standing repo facility, additional work would be neces- sary to assess the likely implications of different design choices for a standing repo facility, such as pricing, eligi- ble counterparties, and the set of acceptable collateral. Echoing issues raised at the Committee’s June 2019 meeting, various participants commented on the need to carefully evaluate these design choices to guard against the potential for moral hazard, stigma, disintermediation risk, or excessive volatility in the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet. A couple of other participants suggested that an approach based on modestly sized, frequent repo op- erations that could be quickly and substantially ramped up in response to emerging market pressures would mit- igate the moral hazard, disintermediation, and stigmati- zation risks associated with a standing repo facility. Participants made no decisions at this meeting on the longer-run role of repo operations in the ample-reserves regime or on an approach for conducting repo opera- tions over the longer run. They generally agreed that they should continue to monitor the market effects of the Federal Reserve’s ongoing repo operations and Treasury bill purchases and that additional analysis of the recent period of money market dislocations or of fluctu- ations in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities was warranted. Some participants called for further research on the role that the financial regulatory environment or other factors may have played in the recent dislocations. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the October 29–30 meet- ing indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) in- creased at a moderate rate in the third quarter. Con- sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per- centage change in the price index for personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in August. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a slower pace in September than in the previous two months, but the average pace for the third quarter was similar to that for the first half of the year. However, the pace of job gains so far this year was slower than last year, even after accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employ- ment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020. The unemployment rate moved down to a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in September, while the labor force participation rate held steady and the em- ployment-to-population ratio moved up. The unem- ployment rates for Asians, Hispanics, and whites each moved lower in September, but the rate for African Americans was unchanged; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion, though persistent differentials be- tween these rates remained. The average share of work- ers employed part time for economic reasons in Septem- ber continued to be below its level in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings declined in August, and the rate of quits also edged down, but both readings were still at relatively elevated levels. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid-October remained near historically low levels. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem- ber, roughly similar to the pace a year earlier. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.8 percent over that same 12-month period, while con- sumer food price inflation was well below core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in August. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in Septem- ber, while core CPI inflation was 2.4 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla- tion expectations—including those from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Blue Chip Eco- nomic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed, on balance, although the Michigan survey measure ticked down to the low end of its recent range. Real PCE rose solidly in the third quarter following a stronger gain in the second quarter. Overall consumer spending rose steadily in recent months, and sales of light motor vehicles through September maintained their robust second-quarter pace. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including the low unemployment rate, further gains in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low borrowing rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. The Michigan survey measure of consumer _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 7 sentiment rose again in October and had mostly recov- ered from its August slump, while the Conference Board survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a favorable level. Real residential investment turned up solidly in the third quarter following six consecutive quarters of contrac- tion. This upturn was consistent with the rise in single- family starts in the third quarter, and building permits for such units—which tend to be a good indicator for the underlying trend in the construction of such homes—also increased. Both new and existing home sales increased, on net, in August and September. Taken together, the data on construction and sales suggested that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 was starting to show through to housing activity. Real nonresidential private fixed investment declined further in the third quarter. Nominal shipments of non- defense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased over August and September, and forward-looking indicators generally pointed to continued softness in business equipment spending. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased over those two months and were still below the level of shipments, most measures of business sentiment deteriorated, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth de- clined somewhat further, and concerns about trade de- velopments continued to weigh on firms’ investment de- cisions. Business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures decreased markedly further in the third quarter, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in op- eration—an indicator of business spending for struc- tures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to de- cline through mid-October. Industrial production declined in September and was notably lower than at the beginning of the year. Produc- tion in September was held down by the strike at Gen- eral Motors, and automakers’ schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would remain low in October before rebounding in November. Overall man- ufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally weak readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business investment, weak GDP growth abroad, and a persistent drag from trade developments. Total real government purchases rose at a slower pace in the third quarter than in the second quarter. Real federal purchases decelerated, reflecting smaller increases in both defense and nondefense spending. Federal hiring of temporary workers for next year’s decennial census was quite modest during the quarter. Real purchases by state and local governments also rose at a slower pace, as the boost from a faster expansion in state and local payrolls was partially offset by a decrease in real con- struction spending by these governments. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in August, reflecting a subdued pace of export growth and a moderate pace of import growth. Export growth was subdued due to lackluster exports of services and capital goods. Advance estimates for September suggested that goods imports fell more than exports, pointing to a nar- rowing of the monthly trade deficit. The Bureau of Eco- nomic Analysis estimated that net exports made a slight negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter. Incoming data suggested that growth in the foreign economies remained subpar in the third quarter. In sev- eral advanced foreign economies (AFEs), indicators showed continued weakness in the manufacturing sec- tor, especially in the euro area and the United Kingdom. Similarly, GDP growth remained subdued in China and several other emerging economies in Asia, and indicators suggested that growth in Latin America also remained weak. Foreign inflation appeared to have moderated a bit in the third quarter, reflecting declines in energy prices. Inflation remained relatively low in most foreign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment weakened over the early part of the intermeeting period, reflecting a few weaker-than-ex- pected domestic data releases, but later strengthened on increased optimism regarding ongoing trade negotia- tions between the United States and China and positive Brexit news. On net, equity prices and corporate bond spreads were little changed, and the Treasury yield curve steepened a bit. Financing conditions for businesses and households remained generally supportive of spending and economic activity. September FOMC communications were viewed as slightly less accommodative than expected, with inves- tors reportedly surprised by the Summary of Economic Projections showing that a majority of FOMC partici- pants anticipated no further easing this year. Incoming data early in the intermeeting period—particularly the disappointing readings on business activity—prompted a decline in the market-implied path for the policy rate, but that decline was later partly reversed as market par- ticipants apparently grew more optimistic on the pro- spects for a U.S.–China trade deal and Brexit negotia- tions. Late in the period, quotes on federal funds futures Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ options contracts indicated that market participants as- signed a very high probability to a 25 basis point reduc- tion in the target range of the federal funds rate at the October FOMC meeting. In addition, market-implied expectations for the federal funds rate at year-end and next year moved down. Yields on nominal U.S. Treasury securities moved down in the early part of the intermeeting period but later re- traced their declines. On net, the Treasury yield curve steepened a bit, mostly reflecting a modest decline in short-term yields. Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities inched down and remained near multiyear low levels. Broad stock price indexes fell by as much as 4 percent during the first half of the intermeeting period but re- covered afterward, ending the period roughly un- changed. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in- dex declined slightly and ended the period below the middle of its historical distribution. On net, corporate credit spreads were little changed. Domestic short-term funding markets were volatile in mid-September and exhibited additional, albeit modest, pressures around the September quarter-end and the mid-October Treasury settlement date. These pressures were alleviated in part by the Desk’s overnight and term repo operations that began on September 17. After smoothing through rate volatility over the period, inter- est rates for overnight unsecured and secured funding declined roughly in line with the reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meeting and the associated 30 basis point decrease in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) was more volatile than usual over the intermeeting period, with the EFFR–IOER spread ranging between 2 basis points and 10 basis points. Rates on overnight commercial paper (CP) and short-term negotiable certificates of deposit declined fairly quickly following the announcement of Desk op- erations on September 17, although some CP rates re- mained elevated into October. The FOMC’s Octo- ber 11 announcement of Treasury bill purchases and repo operations to maintain reserves at or above their early-September level appeared to improve expectations about funding market conditions through the remainder of the year. These communications reportedly did not materially affect yields on longer-term Treasury securi- ties. Financial markets in the AFEs followed a pattern similar to that seen in the United States. AFE financial condi- tions tightened early in the intermeeting period on dis- appointing activity data, both in the United States and abroad, and subsequently recovered on perceived better prospects for trade and Brexit negotiations. Movements in the exchange value of the dollar against most curren- cies were relatively modest, and the broad dollar index declined slightly. Relative to the dollar, the British pound appreciated on Brexit developments, and the Ar- gentinian peso continued to depreciate amid the coun- try’s political developments. The mid-September increases in U.S. Treasury repo rates spilled over to borrowing rates in the international dollar funding market. However, the measures taken by the Federal Reserve to keep the federal funds rate in the tar- get range also calmed dollar funding conditions in the foreign exchange swap market. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re- mained generally accommodative during the intermeet- ing period. Gross issuance of corporate bonds, which was strong in September, experienced a typical seasonal decline in October. Gross issuance of institutional lev- eraged loans remained solid but slightly below 2019 monthly averages. Meanwhile, growth of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans at banks was modest in the third quarter as a whole. Respondents to the October 2019 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that borrower de- mand weakened for C&I loans over the third quarter, while lending standards on such loans were about un- changed. Gross equity issuance through both initial and seasoned offerings picked up to a strong pace in Septem- ber but moderated in October. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated slightly in recent months but remained solid on balance. Credit condi- tions for both small businesses and municipalities stayed accommodative on net. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions also remained generally accommodative. The volume of agency and non-agency commercial mort- gage-backed securities issuance was strong in Septem- ber, in part supported by recent declines in interest rates. Growth of CRE loans on banks’ books was little changed in the third quarter. Banks in the October SLOOS reported tighter lending standards for all types of CRE loans; they also reported weaker demand for construction lending and stronger demand for the other CRE lending categories. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 9 Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative on balance. Mortgage rates were little changed since the September FOMC meeting and stayed near their lowest level since mid-2016. In remained September, home-purchase originations around the relatively high level seen during the previous two months, while refinancing originations jumped to their highest level since late 2012. In the October SLOOS, banks left their lending standards basically un- changed for most residential real estate loan categories over the third quarter. However, for subprime loans, a moderate net percentage of banks reported tightening standards. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained generally supportive of household spending, al- though conditions continued to be tight for credit card borrowers with nonprime credit scores. Interest rates on auto loans fell, on net, since the beginning of the year, and interest rates on credit card accounts leveled off through August. According to the October SLOOS, commercial banks tightened their standards on credit cards and other consumer loans over the third quarter. Additionally, banks reported that their standards on auto loans and their willingness to make consumer install- ment loans were about unchanged on balance. The staff provided an update on its assessments of po- tential risks to financial stability. On balance, the staff characterized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. fi- nancial system as moderate. The staff judged that, for many asset classes, valuation pressures eased over the past year. Appetite for risk in the leveraged loan market remained elevated, but less so than last year, especially for lower-rated loans. In addition, CRE prices remained high relative to rental income. In assessing vulnerabili- ties stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors, the staff noted that, while household borrowing continued to decline relative to nominal GDP, business leverage remained at or near record-high levels. The risks associated with leverage at financial in- stitutions were viewed as being low, as they have been for some time, largely because of high capital ratios at large banks. Nonetheless, the staff noted that the resili- ence of financial institutions could be undermined by low interest rates and banks’ announced plans to in- crease payouts to shareholders. The staff assessed vul- nerabilities stemming from funding risk as modest. In addition, the staff discussed the potential for liquidity transformation by open-ended mutual funds investing in bank loans to lead to market dislocations under stress scenarios, while noting that outflows from such funds have not often been associated with such dislocations. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the October FOMC meeting was revised down a little for the second half of this year relative to the previous projection. This revision reflected the esti- mated effects of the strike at General Motors along with some other small factors. Even without this downward revision, real GDP was forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly because of continued soft business investment and slower increases in government spending. The medium- term projection for real GDP growth was essentially un- changed, as revisions to the staff’s assumptions about factors on which the forecast was conditioned, such as financial market variables, were small and offsetting. Real GDP was expected to decelerate modestly over the medium term, mostly because of a waning boost from fiscal policy. Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 and 2020 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2021 and 2022. The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat through 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. The staff’s forecast for core PCE price inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data. Be- yond this year, the projection for core inflation was un- revised, and the forecast for total inflation was a little lower in 2020 because of a downward revision in pro- jected consumer energy prices. Both total inflation and core inflation were forecast to move up slightly next year, as the low inflation readings early this year were inflation viewed as measures were forecast to continue to run somewhat be- low 2 percent through 2022. transitory; nevertheless, both The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the up- side for the unemployment rate. Important factors in that assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant nega- tive effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in busi- ness investment and manufacturing so far this year was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected. The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ having a downward skew, in part because of the down- side risks to the forecast for economic activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in- vestment and exports had remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 per- cent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in- flation expectations were little changed. Participants generally viewed the economic outlook as positive. Participants judged that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective were the most likely outcomes, and they indicated that their views on these outcomes had changed little since the September meeting. Uncertainties associated with trade tensions as well as geopolitical risks had eased somewhat, though they remained elevated. In addition, inflation pressures remained muted. The risk that a global growth slowdown would further weigh on the do- mestic economy remained prominent. In their discussion of the household sector, participants agreed that consumer spending was increasing at a strong pace. They also generally expected that, in the period ahead, household spending would likely remain on a firm footing, supported by strong labor market con- ditions, rising incomes, and favorable financial condi- tions. In addition, survey measures of consumer confi- dence remained high, and a couple of participants com- mented that business contacts in consumer-facing indus- tries reported strong demand. Many participants noted that components of household spending that are thought to be particularly sensitive to interest rates had improved, including purchases of consumer durables. In addition, residential investment had turned up. Most participants who reported on spending by households in their Districts also cited favorable conditions for con- sumer spending, although several participants reported mixed data on spending or an increase in precautionary savings in their Districts. In their discussions of the business sector, participants saw trade tensions and concerns about the global growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak busi- ness investment and exports and the associated restraint on domestic economic growth. Moreover, participants generally expected that trade uncertainty and sluggish global growth would continue to damp investment spending and exports. A number of participants judged that tight labor market conditions were also causing firms to forego investment expenditures, or invest in au- tomation systems to reduce the need for additional hir- ing. However, business sentiment appeared to remain strong for some industries, particularly those most closely connected with consumer goods. Participants discussed developments in the manufactur- ing, energy, and agricultural sectors of the U.S. economy. Manufacturing production remained weak, and continu- ing concerns about global growth and trade uncertainty suggested that conditions were unlikely to improve ma- terially over the near term. In addition, the labor strike at General Motors had disrupted motor vehicle output, and ongoing issues at Boeing were slowing manufactur- ing in the commercial aircraft industry. A couple of par- ticipants noted that activity was particularly weak for the energy industry, in part because of low petroleum prices. In addition, a few participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with lower crop yields, tariffs, weak export demand, and dif- ficult financial positions for many farmers. One bright spot for the agricultural sector was that some commod- ity prices had firmed recently. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate near his- torical lows and continued solid job gains, on average. In addition, some participants commented on the strength or improvement in labor force participation na- tionally or in their Districts. However, the pace of in- creases in employment had slowed some, on net, in re- cent months. On the one hand, the slowing could be interpreted as a natural consequence of the economy be- ing near full employment. On the other hand, slowing job gains might also be indicative of some cooling in la- bor demand, which may be consistent with an observed decline in the rate of job openings and decreases in other measures of labor market tightness. Several participants commented that the preliminary benchmark revision re- leased in August by the Bureau of Labor Statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year. Growth of wages had also slowed this year by some measures. Consistent with strong national data on _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 11 the labor market, business contacts in many Districts in- dicated continued strong labor demand, with firms still reporting difficulties finding qualified workers, or broad- ening their recruiting to include traditionally marginal- ized groups. In their discussion of inflation developments, partici- pants noted that readings on overall and core PCE infla- tion, measured on a 12-month change basis, had contin- ued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective. While survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were generally little changed, some measures of households’ inflation expectations had moved down to historically low levels. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low, with some longer-term measures being at or near multi-year lows. Weakness in the global economy, perceptions of downside risks to growth, and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as factors tilting inflation risk to the downside, and a few participants commented that they expected inflation to run below 2 percent for some time. Some other participants, however, saw the recent infla- tion data as consistent with their previous assessment that much of the weakness seen early in the year would be transitory, or that some recent monthly readings seemed broadly consistent with the Committee's longer- run inflation objective of 2 percent. A couple of partic- ipants noted that some measures of inflation could tem- porarily move above 2 percent early next year because of the transitory effects of tariffs. Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity, which remained tilted to the downside. Some risks were seen to have eased a bit, al- though they remained elevated. There were some tenta- tive signs that trade tensions were easing, the probability of a no-deal Brexit was judged to have lessened, and some other geopolitical tensions had diminished. Sev- eral participants noted that statistical models designed to gauge the probability of recession, including those based on information from the yield curve, suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen somewhat over the intermeeting period. However, other downside risks had not diminished. In particular, some further signs of a global slowdown in economic growth emerged; weakening in the global economy could further restrain the domestic economy, and the risk that the weakness in domestic business spending, manufacturing, and exports could give rise to slower hiring and weigh on household spending re- mained prominent. Among those participants who commented on financial stability, most highlighted the risks associated with high levels of corporate indebtedness and elevated valuation pressures for a variety of risky assets. Although financial stability risks overall were seen as moderate, several par- ticipants indicated that imbalances in the corporate debt market had grown over the economic expansion and raised the concern that deteriorating credit quality could lead to sharp increases in risk spreads in corporate bond markets; these developments could amplify the effects of an adverse shock to the economy. Several partici- pants were concerned that some banks had reduced the sizes of their capital buffers at a time when they should be rising. A few participants observed that valuations in equity and bond markets were high by historical stand- ards and that CRE valuations were also elevated. A cou- ple of participants indicated that market participants may be overly optimistic in the pricing of risk for corporate debt. A couple of participants judged that the monitor- ing of financial stability vulnerabilities should also en- compass risks related to climate change. In their consideration of the monetary policy options at this meeting, most participants believed that a reduction of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate. In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants continued to point to global developments weighing on the economic outlook, the need to provide insurance against potential downside risks to the economic outlook, and the importance of returning inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 per- cent objective on a sustained basis. A couple of partici- pants who were supportive of a rate cut at this meeting indicated that the decision to reduce the federal funds rate by 25 basis points was a close call relative to the op- tion of leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting. Many participants judged that an additional modest eas- ing at this meeting was appropriate in light of persistent weakness in global growth and elevated uncertainty re- garding trade developments. Nonetheless, these partic- ipants noted that incoming data had continued to sug- gest that the economy had proven resilient in the face of continued headwinds from global developments and that previous adjustments to monetary policy would continue to help sustain economic growth. In addition, several participants suggested that a modest easing of policy at this meeting would likely better align the target range for the federal funds rate with a variety of indica- tors used to assess the appropriate policy stance, includ- ing estimates of the neutral interest rate and the slope of the yield curve. A couple of participants judged that Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ there was more room for the labor market to improve. Accordingly, they saw further accommodation as best supporting both of the Committee’s dual-mandate ob- jectives. Many participants continued to view the downside risks surrounding the economic outlook as elevated, further underscoring the case for a rate cut at this meeting. In particular, risks to the outlook associated with global economic growth and international trade were still seen as significant despite some encouraging geopolitical and trade-related developments over the intermeeting pe- riod. In light of these risks, a number of participants were concerned that weakness in business spending, manufacturing, and exports could spill over to labor markets and consumer spending and threaten the eco- nomic expansion. A few participants observed that the considerations favoring easing at this meeting were rein- forced by the proximity of the federal funds rate to the ELB. In their view, providing adequate accommodation while still away from the ELB would best mitigate the possibility of a costly return to the ELB. Many participants also cited the level of inflation or in- flation expectations as justifying a reduction of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate at this meeting. Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective, and inflationary pressures remained muted. Several participants raised concerns that measures of inflation expectations remained low and could decline further without a more accommodative policy stance. A couple of these participants, pointing to experiences in Japan and the euro area, were con- cerned that persistent inflation shortfalls could lead to a decline in longer-run inflation expectations and less room to reduce the federal funds rate in the event of a future recession. In general, the participants who justi- fied further easing at this meeting based on considera- tions related to inflation viewed this action as helping to move inflation up to the Committee’s 2 percent objec- tive on a sustained basis and to anchor inflation expec- tations at levels consistent with that objective. Some participants favored maintaining the existing tar- get range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. These participants suggested that the baseline projection for the economy remained favorable, with inflation ex- pected to move up and stay near the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective. They also judged that policy accommo- dation was already adequate and, in light of lags in the transmission of monetary policy, preferred to take some time to assess the economic effects of the Committee’s previous policy actions before easing policy further. Several participants noted that downside risks had di- minished over the intermeeting period and saw little in- dication that weakness in business sentiment was spilling over into labor markets and consumer spending. A few participants raised the concern that a further easing of monetary policy at this meeting could encourage exces- sive risk-taking and exacerbate imbalances in the finan- cial sector. With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, most participants judged that the stance of policy, after a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting, would be well calibrated to support the outlook of moderate growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective and likely would remain so as long as incoming information about the economy did not result in a material reassessment of the economic outlook. However, participants noted that policy was not on a preset course and that they would be monitor- ing the effects of the Committee’s recent policy actions, as well as other information bearing on the economic outlook, in assessing the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. A couple of participants expressed the view that the Committee should reinforce its postmeeting statement with additional communica- tions indicating that another reduction in the federal funds rate was unlikely in the near term unless incoming information was consistent with a significant slowdown in the pace of economic activity. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the Sep- tember meeting indicated that the labor market re- mained strong and that economic activity had been ris- ing at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on av- erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had been rising at a strong pace. However, business fixed investment and exports remained weak, as softness in global growth and international trade developments continued to weigh on those sectors. On a 12-month basis, both the overall inflation rate and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low. Sur- vey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions were little changed. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pres- sures, most members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent at this meeting. The members who supported this action _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 13 viewed it as consistent with helping offset the effects on aggregate demand of weak global growth and trade de- velopments, insuring against downside risks arising from those sources, and promoting a more rapid return of in- flation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive. Two members preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. These members indicated that the economic outlook re- mained positive and that they anticipated, under an un- changed policy stance, continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective. Members agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to its maximum- employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objective. They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to update the language of the Committee’s de- scription of incoming data to acknowledge that invest- ment spending and U.S. exports had remained weak. In describing the monetary policy outlook, they also agreed to remove the “act as appropriate” language and empha- size that the Committee would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assessed the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. This change was seen as consistent with the view that the current stance of monetary policy was likely to remain appropriate as long as the economy performed broadly in line with the Com- mittee’s expectations and that policy was not on a preset course and could change if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the economic outlook. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective October 31, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent. In light of recent and ex- pected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non- reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to con- duct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely af- fect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct over- night reverse repurchase operations (and re- verse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accom- modate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such op- erations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are run- ning below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expec- tations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. In light of the implications of global developments for the economic out- look as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent. This action supports the Committee’s view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective are the most likely outcomes, but uncer- tainties about this outlook remain. The Com- mittee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic out- look as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: Esther L. George and Eric Rosengren. President George dissented at this meeting because she believed that an unchanged setting of monetary policy was appropriate based on incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term. Recogniz- ing risks to the outlook from the effects of trade devel- opments and weaker global activity, President George would be prepared to adjust policy should incoming data point to a materially weaker outlook for the economy. President Rosengren dissented because he judged that monetary policy was already accommodative and that additional accommodation was not needed for an econ- omy in which labor markets are very tight. He judged that providing additional accommodation posed risks of further inflating the prices of risky assets and encourag- ing households and firms to take on too much leverage. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ per- cent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess re- serve balances to 1.55 percent and voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 2.25 percent, effective October 31, 2019. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 10– 11, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on Octo- ber 30, 2019. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on October 8, 2019, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on September 17–18, 2019. Videoconference meeting of October 4, 2019 The Committee met by videoconference on October 4, 2019, to review developments in money markets and to discuss steps the Committee could take to facilitate effi- cient and effective implementation of monetary policy. The staff reviewed recent developments in money mar- kets and the effect of the Desk’s continued offering of overnight and term repo operations. Staff analysis and market commentary suggested that many factors con- tributed to the funding stresses that emerged in mid-Sep- tember. In particular, financial institutions’ internal risk limits and balance sheet costs may have slowed the dis- tribution of liquidity across the system at a time when reserves had dropped sharply and Treasury issuance was elevated. Although money market conditions had since improved, market participants expressed uncertainty about how funding market conditions may evolve over coming months, especially around year-end. Further _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of October 29–30, 2019Page 15 out, the April 2020 tax season, with associated reduc- tions in reserves around that time, was viewed as another point at which money market pressures could emerge. of monetary policy implementation not intended to af- fect the stance of monetary policy and should be com- municated as such. The manager pro tem reviewed options that the Com- mittee could consider to boost the level of reserves in the banking system and to address temporary money market pressures that could adversely affect monetary policy implementation. These options included a pro- gram of Treasury bill purchases coupled with overnight and term repo operations to maintain reserves at or above their early September level. During their discussion, all FOMC participants agreed that control over the federal funds rate was a priority and that recent money market developments suggested it was appropriate to consider steps at this time to maintain a level of reserves consistent with the Committee’s cho- sen ample-reserves regime. Given the projected decline in reserves around year-end and in the spring of 2020, they judged that it was important to reach consensus soon on a near-term plan and associated communica- tions. All participants expressed support for a plan to purchase Treasury bills into the second quarter of 2020 and to continue conducting overnight and term repo opera- tions at least through January of next year. Many partic- ipants supported conducting operations to maintain re- serve balances around the level that prevailed in early September. Some others suggested moving to an even higher level of reserves to provide an extra buffer and greater assurance of control over the federal funds rate. In discussing the pace of Treasury bill purchases, many participants supported a relatively rapid pace to boost reserve levels quickly, while others supported a more moderate pace of purchases. Participants generally judged that Treasury bill purchases and the associated increase in reserves would, over time, result in a gradual reduction in the need for repo operations. A few partic- ipants indicated that purchasing Treasury notes and bonds with limited remaining maturities could also be considered as a way to boost reserves, particularly if the Federal Reserve faced constraints on the pace at which it could purchase Treasury bills. Participants generally acknowledged some uncertainty over the efficient and effective level of reserves and noted it would be prudent to continue to monitor money market developments and stand ready to adjust the plan as necessary. Overall, par- ticipants agreed that the pace of purchases as well as the parameters of the repo operations were technical details Most participants preferred not to wait until the Octo- ber 29–30 FOMC meeting to issue a public statement regarding the planned Treasury bill purchases and repo operations. They noted that releasing a statement before the October 29–30 FOMC meeting would help rein- force the point that these actions were technical and not intended to affect the stance of policy. In addition, a few participants remarked that an earlier release would allow the Desk to begin boosting the level of reserves sooner. A couple of participants, however, wanted to wait until the October 29–30 FOMC meeting to announce the plan so as not to surprise market participants or lead them to infer that the Committee regarded the situation as dire and thus requiring immediate action. The Chair proposed having the staff produce a draft statement that the Committee could comment on early in the following week. Formal approval could occur by notation vote with an anticipated release of a statement to the public on October 11, 2019. Participants discussed longer-term issues that the Com- mittee might want to study once the near-term plan was in place. In particular, many participants mentioned that the Committee may want to continue its previous dis- cussion of a standing repo facility as a part of the long- run implementation framework. Almost all of these par- ticipants noted that such a facility was an option to pro- vide a backstop to buffer shocks that could adversely af- fect policy implementation, and several of these partici- pants mentioned the potential for the facility to support banks’ liquidity risk management while reducing the de- mand for reserves. Other participants, instead, high- lighted that policy implementation had worked well with larger quantities of reserves and focused their discussion on actions to firmly establish an ample supply of reserves over the longer run. A number of participants noted that a discussion of a broader range of factors that affect the level and volatility of reserves may be appropriate at a future meeting. On October 11, 2019, the Committee approved by no- tation vote the following statement that outlines steps to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample so that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of re- serves is not required. Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ STATEMENT REGARDING MONETARY POL- ICY IMPLEMENTATION (Adopted October 11, 2019) Consistent with its January 2019 Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, the Committee reaffirms its intention to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an am- ple supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. To ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample, the Committee approved by notation vote completed on October 11, 2019, the following steps: • In light of recent and expected increases in the Fed- eral Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Federal Re- serve will purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year in order to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. • In addition, the Federal Reserve will conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during peri- ods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. These actions are purely technical measures to support the effective implementation of the FOMC’s monetary policy, and do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. The Committee will continue to mon- itor money market developments as it assesses the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation. The Committee stands ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary to foster ef- ficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. In connection with these plans, the Federal Open Market Committee voted unanimously to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until in- structed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Effective October 15, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-3/4 to 2 percent. In light of recent and ex- pected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non- reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to con- duct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely af- fect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct over- night reverse repurchase operations (and re- verse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accom- modate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such op- erations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” _______________________ James A.

The staff summarized the feedback received through the Fed Lis- tens initiative, a series of 14 public-facing events con- ducted around the country with a broad range of indi- viduals and groups. These events engaged with the pub- lic directly on issues pertaining to the dual-mandate ob- jectives of maximum employment and stable prices. Representatives from underserved communities who participated in the Fed Listens events generally saw the current strong labor market as providing significant ben- efits to their communities, most notably by creating 7 Attended the discussion of economic developments and the outlook. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ greater opportunities for individuals who have experi- enced difficulty finding jobs in the past. Nevertheless, these representatives noted that the benefits from cur- rent labor market conditions flowing to people in their communities were less than those implied by national statistics, and they expressed concerns that the recent gains might not be sustained in the event of an economic downturn. Business representatives reported experienc- ing challenges finding qualified workers and described several initiatives to attract and retain workers, including training programs and a willingness to employ individu- als who are unlikely to have been considered in less fa- vorable labor market conditions. Inflation develop- ments elicited fewer comments at these events and were generally seen as posing less of a challenge than labor market conditions. Representatives of retirees men- tioned difficulties associated with the rising costs of health care and prescription drugs, whereas those repre- senting low- and middle-income communities pointed to the rising costs of basic necessities such as housing, utilities, and food. Business representatives emphasized the importance of low and stable inflation for planning and decisionmaking. Event participants were concerned about rising costs of living and generally perceived low inflation as desirable from that perspective. Event par- ticipants were asked about monetary policymakers’ con- cerns regarding overall inflation running persistently be- low 2 percent; they noted that the Federal Reserve could better communicate its reasons for these concerns. When asked about the effects of changes in interest rates, representatives of underserved communities said that such changes had little effect on many members of their communities who have limited or no access to credit. Representatives of retirees conveyed a more neg- ative view of low interest rates, given the greater reliance of wealthier retirees on interest income. Business repre- sentatives generally found the low interest rate environ- ment beneficial. The staff briefing also included an analysis of distribu- tional considerations for monetary policy. Consistent with the feedback received at the Fed Listens events, the evidence reviewed by the staff showed that workers who are young, less educated, African American, or Hispanic tend to face a greater-than-average risk of losing their jobs during recessions. The staff used simulations from a specific macroeconomic model to explore how heter- ogeneity of households might affect the transmission of economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the economy. The staff’s simulations embedded the as- sumption that households have limited ability to borrow, which makes some households’ consumption spending more sensitive to changes in income. As a result, in these simulations, downturns lead to larger contractions in aggregate demand than would be the case if all house- holds could borrow to support their consumption spending in response to a loss in income. The amplifi- cation of recessionary shocks was especially large when the monetary policy response was constrained by the ef- fective lower bound (ELB) on the policy interest rate. Overall, the analysis suggested that the costs of reces- sions, as well as the benefits of economic stabilization, might be larger than suggested by models that did not account for differences across households regarding their access to credit. Participants agreed that the Fed Listens outreach efforts had informed their understanding of the goals and tradeoffs associated with monetary policy and had pro- vided highly useful input into their deliberations. Several participants voiced their desire to continue the conver- sations initiated at the Fed Listens events. Participants also shared their appreciation of the feedback they re- ceive on a regular basis from members of the public, in- cluding through the Federal Reserve System’s extensive networks of contacts and community outreach efforts. A few participants emphasized that policymakers’ en- gagement with the public helps build trust, fosters trans- parency, and reinforces the credibility of the Federal Re- serve. Participants generally saw the feedback from Fed Listens events as reinforcing the importance of sustaining the economic expansion so that the effects of a persistently strong job market reach more of those who, in the past, had experienced difficulty finding employment. Several participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor mar- ket conditions helps workers build skills and cement their attachment to the labor force in a manner that might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns and might increase the maximum sustainable level of employment over the longer run. A number of partici- pants also emphasized that sustaining strong labor mar- ket conditions is helpful for meeting the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. Some participants spoke to some of the challenges asso- ciated with assessing the maximum level of employment. A few participants noted that aggregate statistics mask significant heterogeneity in labor market outcomes. A few others pointed to the continued absence of signifi- cant wage and price pressure—traditionally seen as a symptom of a tight labor market—even as the unem- ployment rate had moved below most estimates of its longer-run level. A few participants raised the possibility that the maximum sustainable level of employment had Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ increased as the expansion continued to draw workers who would otherwise not be in the labor force. Regarding inflation, participants recognized that seg- ments of the public generally do not regard the fact that aggregate inflation is running modestly below the Com- mittee’s 2 percent goal as a problem. A few participants noted that the public’s view on this issue was under- standable from the perspective of households and busi- nesses going about their daily lives in an economy with low and stable inflation. That said, a couple of partici- pants cautioned that inflation could emerge as a concern among members of the public if it became more volatile or ran at levels substantially away from the Committee’s goal. Many participants also warned about the macro- economic consequences of not achieving 2 percent on a sustained basis. In particular, if inflation ran persistently below the Committee’s objective, longer-term inflation expectations could drift down, resulting in lower actual inflation. With lower inflation, nominal interest rates would be lower as well and therefore closer to the ELB. As a result, the scope for monetary policy to support the economy in a future downturn through interest rate cuts would be reduced, a situation that would likely worsen economic outcomes for households and businesses. In light of these considerations, participants generally agreed that they need to communicate more clearly to the public their rationale for, and commitment to, achieving 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis and of ensuring that longer-run inflation expectations are an- chored at levels consistent with this objective. To ensure the effectiveness of these and other communications, several participants stressed that the Federal Reserve needs to adapt its communications to various audiences. A few participants emphasized that communications about the Committee’s resolve to return inflation to 2 percent need to be backed with actions and results to ensure that the public sees these communications as credible. With respect to the role of distributional considerations in the pursuit of the dual-mandate objectives, several participants noted that it was important for policymakers to be cognizant of how monetary policy affects different segments of the population. Most participants com- mented on the large costs that recessions and high un- employment impose on communities, notably on their most vulnerable constituents, and stressed the need for monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first place or reduce their severity when they occur. A num- ber of these participants emphasized that, while mone- tary policy actions can have different effects across groups, monetary policy actions that are driven by the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices ulti- mately benefit all groups. Participants viewed the role of monetary policy as supporting a strong, stable econ- omy that benefits all Americans. Various participants noted that monetary policy is a blunt instrument whose effects cannot be targeted to specific communities. Sev- eral participants remarked that while monetary policy ac- tions can improve the conditions of vulnerable commu- nities, notably by supporting a strong job market, these actions may not reduce inequality in wealth and income. For these and other reasons, many participants empha- sized that policies other than monetary policy are appro- priate to directly address inequality. In addition, a couple of participants cautioned that maintaining accommoda- tive financial conditions could be counterproductive if doing so fueled financial imbalances and exacerbated the next economic downturn. Participants agreed that their review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices would con- tinue at future meetings and, as a result, that the Com- mittee would not reaffirm its existing Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy at the January 2020 meeting. The Committee plans to revisit this statement closer to the conclusion of the review, likely around the middle of 2020. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account manager first re- viewed developments in financial markets over the inter- meeting period. Market prices appeared to respond mainly to signs of stabilization in the U.S. and global economies and to developments associated with trade policy. Market participants noted some risks to the out- look including Brexit and geopolitical factors. Regarding expectations for U.S. monetary policy, the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys and market-based indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of no change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by the medians of survey respondents’ modal forecasts remained essentially flat through 2020. Survey- and market-implied uncertainty about the near- term outlook for monetary policy declined, with market commentary attributing the decrease in part to the Com- mittee’s October communications. Survey respondents placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over 2020 than an increase. The manager turned next to a review of money market developments since the October meeting, starting with an update on the implementation of the Committee’s Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ strategy to ensure ample reserves. Reserve management purchases of Treasury bills continued at a pace of $60 billion per month, with propositions remaining strong and little discernible effect on market function- ing. While these purchases accumulated, the Desk con- tinued to conduct regular repurchase agreement (repo) operations in order to maintain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early September. Repos outstand- ing from these Desk operations totaled roughly $215 bil- lion per day, consisting of both overnight and term op- erations. As reserve levels increased, the distribution of reserves across bank types became comparable with where it was in early September. The federal funds rate and other overnight money market rates fell modestly and were close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate for most of the period. The intraday dispersion of rates was also lower than when reserves were at similar levels be- fore September. In addition to helping keep reserves ample, repo operations likely have reduced pressures in money markets and the dispersion in money market rates. With respect to conditions around year-end, the man- ager noted that forward measures of market pricing con- tinued to indicate expectations of temporary upward pressures on some secured rates. Money market rates are often volatile around year-end, and Federal Reserve operations are not intended to eliminate all year-end pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply re- mains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy. The Desk had already conducted three longer- term repo operations spanning year-end—for a total of $75 billion—and planned to announce an additional longer-term operation, as well as increase the amount of overnight repo offered around the year-end date. The manager reported that the Desk is closely monitoring re- serves and money market conditions and that it is pre- pared to adjust plans as needed. The manager discussed two operational considerations around policy implementation. The first involved the risk that future Treasury bill purchases could have a larger effect on liquidity in the Treasury bill market in light of expected seasonal declines in bill issuance and the Federal Reserve’s growing ownership share of out- standing bills. If this risk were to materialize, the Federal Reserve could consider expanding the universe of secu- rities purchased for reserve management purposes to in- clude coupon-bearing Treasury securities with a short time to maturity. Purchases of these short-dated securi- ties would not affect broader financial conditions or the stance of monetary policy. The manager also discussed expectations to gradually transition away from active repo operations next year as Treasury bill purchases sup- ply a larger base of reserves. The calendar of repo oper- ations starting in mid-January could reflect a gradual re- duction in active repo operations. The manager indi- cated that some repos might be needed at least through April, when tax payments will sharply reduce reserve lev- els. As reserves remain ample, the manager noted that it may become appropriate at some point to implement a tech- nical adjustment to the IOER rate and the offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase (ON RRP) agreements. Should conditions warrant this adjustment, the IOER rate could move closer to the middle of the target range for the federal funds rate, and the ON RRP rate could be realigned with the bottom of the target range. The manager also noted that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York communicated to its customers that the remuneration rate on the foreign repo pool will be re- vised to be generally equivalent to the overnight reverse repo rate. This action may reduce activity in the pool to some extent and increase the level of reserves. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the December 10–11 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) was increasing at a moderate rate in the second half of 2019. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 per- cent in October. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment surged in Novem- ber, boosted in part by the return of auto workers who had previously been on strike in October. The average pace of job gains over the three months ending in No- vember, which is unaffected by the strike, was stronger than earlier in 2019. However, the rate of increase in payrolls so far this year was slower than last year, even accounting for the anticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ benchmark revision to payroll employ- ment, which will be incorporated in the published data in February 2020. The unemployment rate ticked up in October but then moved back down to its 50-year low Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ of 3.5 percent in November; the labor force participa- tion rate and the employment-to-population ratio held steady, on balance, over those two months. The unem- ployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispan- ics, and whites were little changed, on net, over the past two months; the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic ex- pansion, though persistent differentials between these rates remained. The average share of workers employed part time for economic reasons in November stayed be- low its level in late 2007. Both the rate of private-sector job openings and the rate of quits edged down in Sep- tember, but these readings were still at fairly elevated lev- els. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through late Novem- ber remained near historically low levels. In general, re- cent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be moderate. Total labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 3.7 percent over the four quar- ters ending in the third quarter. The employment cost index for private-sector workers rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in October. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12-month period, while con- sumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation and consumer energy prices declined. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 percent in October. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.1 percent over the 12 months ending in No- vember, while core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent. Re- cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Survey of Consumer Expectations from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Sur- vey of Market Participants—were little changed, on bal- ance; the Michigan survey measure ticked back down in early December to the bottom of its recent range after ticking up in November. Real PCE continued to expand in October following a strong gain in the third quarter. Sales of light motor ve- hicles rose markedly in November. Key factors that in- fluence consumer spending—including the low unem- ployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable in- come, high levels of households’ net worth, and gener- ally low interest rates—were supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. The Michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment rose again in early De- cember to an upbeat level and had more than recovered from its drop in August; the Conference Board survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a favora- ble level in November. Real residential investment appeared to be increasing further after rising solidly in the third quarter. Both starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes increased in October, and starts of multifamily units also rose. Existing home sales continued to in- crease in October, although new home sales edged down following a solid gain in the third quarter. All told, the data on construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 has been boosting housing activity. Real nonresidential private fixed investment remained weak overall after declining in the second and third quar- ters. Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased solidly in Oc- tober following a string of decreases, although many for- ward-looking indicators pointed to continued softness in business equipment spending. Most measures of busi- ness sentiment were still downbeat, analysts’ expecta- tions of firms’ longer-term profit growth edged down further, and concerns about trade developments contin- ued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures out- side of the drilling and mining sector continued to de- cline in October, and the total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sec- tor—fell further through early December. Industrial production decreased in October and re- mained notably lower than at the beginning of the year. Production in October continued to be held down by the strike at General Motors, although the end of the strike and automakers’ schedules suggested that assem- blies of light motor vehicles would rebound in Novem- ber. Overall manufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months, reflecting generally weak readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys, declining domestic business in- vestment, slow economic growth abroad, and a persis- tent drag from trade developments. Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Total real government purchases were increasing slowly in the fourth quarter. Nominal defense spending in Oc- tober pointed to only a modest rise in real federal gov- ernment purchases. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to be moving roughly sideways; state and local payrolls expanded modestly, on net, over October and November, and nominal construction spending by these governments was about flat in Octo- ber. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in October. Exports fell a little, with declines in all export categories except for services and industrial supplies. Imports fell much more, and the declines were broad based, with the largest contributions coming from im- ports of consumer goods and automotive products. Available trade data suggested that the contribution of net exports to real GDP growth, which was slightly neg- ative in the third quarter, would turn somewhat positive in the fourth quarter. Foreign economic growth slowed further in the third quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufac- turing sector. Recent monthly indicators pointed to a stabilization in the pace of economic growth in China and several advanced foreign economies. However, other indicators suggested that social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in several countries, most notably in Hong Kong, and that weakness persisted in parts of Latin America. Foreign inflation picked up somewhat as energy prices stabilized, although inflation remained relatively low in most foreign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment fluctuated over the intermeeting pe- riod largely in response to ongoing trade negotiations be- tween the United States and China. On net, equity prices increased moderately while corporate bond spreads nar- rowed slightly. Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little changed. Financing conditions for businesses and households remained supportive of spending and economic activity. Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as suggesting that additional near- term changes to the target range for the federal funds rate were less likely than had previously been expected. A straight read of the probability distribution for the fed- eral funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged at the December FOMC meeting. Forward rates implied by overnight index swap quotes declined slightly, on net, and implied about a 25 basis point decline in the federal funds rate by the end of 2020. Nominal Treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeet- ing period but, on net, the Treasury curve was little changed. Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities increased slightly from near multiyear low levels. Broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed trade-related developments and stronger-than- to expected U.S. employment reports. Option-implied vol- atility on the S&P 500 index increased modestly but re- mained near the low end of its historical distribution. On net, corporate credit spreads narrowed slightly. Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period. Interest rates for over- night secured and unsecured loans fell in line with the 25 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate at the October FOMC meeting. Trading in money markets was orderly, with volumes in normal ranges and spreads narrower relative to the IOER rate. Pressures on rates at October month-end and Novem- ber mid-month—both days with sizable settlements of Treasury auctions—were muted compared with other recent Treasury issuance days. The Desk’s open market operations aimed at maintaining ample reserves pro- ceeded smoothly. As in U.S. markets, sentiment in foreign financial mar- kets fluctuated in response to news on U.S.–China trade negotiations. Most foreign equity price indexes and long-term sovereign yields in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan increased modestly on net. The broad dollar index ended the period little changed. Po- litical unrest in Hong Kong and Latin America garnered some financial market attention and led to a weakening of some Latin American currencies, notably the Chilean peso, but the imprint on broader financial markets was limited. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses re- mained accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate bonds was robust, on average, in October and Novem- ber. Gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans re- mained near recent monthly averages. Meanwhile, com- mercial and industrial loans held by banks contracted in October but increased modestly in November. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated slightly in recent months but remained solid overall. Af- ter particularly strong gross equity issuance in Septem- ber, initial public offerings declined and seasoned offer- ings remained solid in October and November. Credit Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions for both small businesses and municipalities stayed accommodative. 2022 and to remain below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions also remained generally accommodative. (CMBS) Commercial mortgage-backed spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near the low end of their post-crisis range. Agency and non-agency CMBS issuance increased in October to a post-crisis high. CRE loan growth at banks also increased in October relative to recent quarters. securities Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative over the intermeeting period. Mortgage rates were little changed since the October FOMC meeting. Consistent with this year’s decline in mortgage rates, home-purchase originations and refi- nancing originations both rose. Mortgage credit stand- ards were little changed. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained generally supportive of growth in consumer spending, although conditions continued to be tight for nonprime borrowers. Auto loans increased, consistent with significant declines in auto loan interest rates this year. Credit card debt grew at a solid pace, and interest rates on credit card debt began to fall. Consumer asset-backed securities issuance was strong through Oc- tober as spreads stabilized at levels that were somewhat above their post-crisis averages. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was revised up a little for the second half of 2019 relative to the pre- vious projection. This revision primarily reflected in- coming data for household spending and business in- vestment that were somewhat stronger than expected. Even with this upward revision, real GDP was forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half, mostly because of continued soft business investment and slower increases in government spend- ing. The forecast for real GDP growth over the medium term was also revised up a bit, on balance, primarily in response to a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices. Nevertheless, real GDP growth was still ex- pected to slow modestly in the coming years, largely be- cause of a fading boost from fiscal policy. Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s esti- mate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022. The unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat at around its current level through The staff’s forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2019 was revised down a bit, as a downward revision to core PCE prices in response to recent data was partly offset by an upward revision to consumer energy prices. Be- yond 2019, core inflation was expected to be above its pace this year, and this projection was revised up a touch because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current forecast. The projection for total inflation in 2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a projected decline in consumer energy prices. Over the remainder of the medium-term projection, total inflation was expected to be about the same as core inflation, al- though both inflation measures were forecast to con- tinue to run a bit below 2 percent through 2022. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having eased a bit since the pre- vious forecast but still judged that the risks to the fore- cast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unem- ployment rate. Important factors influencing this assess- ment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year were seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slow- ing in economic growth than the staff projected. The risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as hav- ing a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a strong pace, business fixed in- vestment and exports had remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 per- cent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in- flation expectations were little changed. Participants generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective as the most likely outcomes. This outlook re- flected, at least in part, the support provided by the cur- rent stance of monetary policy. Nevertheless, global de- velopments, related to both persistent uncertainty re- garding international trade and weakness in economic growth abroad, continued to pose some risks to the out- look, and inflation pressures remained muted. In their discussion of the household sector, participants agreed that spending had increased at a strong pace. They generally expected that consumption spending would likely remain on a firm footing, supported by strong labor market conditions, rising incomes, and solid consumer confidence. In addition, residential invest- ment had continued to pick up, reflecting, in part, the effects of lower mortgage rates. Many participants com- mented that business contacts in consumer-related in- dustries reported strong demand or that contacts were optimistic about the holiday retail spending season. However, some participants observed that recent data on retail sales or motor vehicle spending had decelerated slightly. With respect to the business sector, participants saw trade developments and concerns about the global eco- nomic growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports. Participants generally expected these factors to continue to damp business investment and exports. They expressed simi- lar concerns about activity in manufacturing industries. A few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years. A few others ob- served that businesses were diversifying their supply chains or investing in technology to adapt to persistent uncertainty regarding international trade, which might mitigate the effects of such uncertainty on future busi- ness spending. A number of participants commented on challenges fac- ing the energy and agriculture sectors. A few partici- pants remarked that activity in the energy sector was es- pecially weak, reflecting low petroleum prices, low prof- itability, and tight financing conditions for energy- producing firms. Several participants noted that the ag- ricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties, in- cluding those associated with trade developments, weak export demand, and challenging financial positions for many farmers. A couple of participants noted that farm subsidies from the federal government were offsetting a portion of the financial strain on farmers. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job gains remaining solid, and some measures of labor force participation increasing further. The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward, and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources. In particu- lar, a number of participants noted that the labor force participation rate could rise further still. Moreover, measures of wage growth had generally remained mod- erate. However, a few participants commented that in- creases in the labor force would likely moderate as slack in the labor market diminished. In addition, a couple of participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark revision released in August by the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year. A couple of other participants thought it was important to better understand the quality of jobs being created. Business contacts in many Districts indi- cated continued strong labor demand, with firms report- ing difficulties in finding qualified workers or broaden- ing their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups. A number of participants noted that wage pres- sures were evident for some industries in their Districts, and a couple of participants commented that firms were responding to those pressures in a variety of ways, in- cluding investing in technology that could serve as a sub- stitute for labor. In their discussion of inflation developments, partici- pants noted that recent readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis, had continued to run below 2 percent. Survey-based Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ measures of longer-term inflation expectations were lit- tle changed, and market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low. A few participants com- mented on factors that may temporarily exert upward pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming months. Assessing all these factors, participants gener- ally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective as the economic expansion continued and re- source utilization remained high. However, weakness abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as sources of risk to this assessment. Participants who expressed less confidence that inflation would return promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that in- flation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased or that global or technology-related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome. Participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity. While many saw the risks as tilted somewhat to the downside, some risks were seen to have eased over recent months. In particular, there were some tentative signs that trade tensions with China were easing, and the probability of a no-deal Brexit was judged to have lessened further. In addition, there were indica- tions that the prospects for global economic growth may be stabilizing. A number of participants observed that the domestic economy was showing resilience in the face of headwinds from global developments. Moreover, sta- tistical models designed to gauge the probability of re- cession using financial market data, including those based on information from the Treasury yield curve, suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months. However, new uncertainties had emerged re- garding trade policy with Argentina, Brazil, and France, and political tensions in Hong Kong persisted. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. As reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook. Of course, if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, the stance of policy would need to adjust in a way that fos- tered the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives. A number of participants agreed that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy would give the Com- mittee some time to assess the full effects on the econ- omy of its policy decisions and communications over the course of this year along with other information bearing on the economic outlook. Participants also discussed how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time could be helpful for cushioning the economy from the global developments that have been weighing on eco- nomic activity and for returning inflation to the Com- mittee’s symmetric objective of 2 percent. Participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation contin- uing to fall short of 2 percent. Although a number of participants noted that some of the factors currently holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory, various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expec- tations was too low. A few participants raised the concern that keeping inter- est rates low over a long period might encourage exces- sive risk-taking, which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector. These participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stabil- ity and policies that keep interest rates persistently low. They remarked that such policies could be inconsistent with sustaining maximum employment, could make the next recession more severe than otherwise, or could strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential tools to guard against emerging imbalances. Various participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy, highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings. Among the topics mentioned were the potential role of a standing repo facility in an ample-reserves regime, the setting of administered rates, and the composition of the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities over the longer run. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the FOMC met in October indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been ris- ing at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on av- erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Although household spending had been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and ex- ports remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall in- flation and inflation for items other than food and en- ergy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions were little changed. Members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objective. And they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to state that they judged that “the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate” to support the achievement of the Committee’s policy objectives. Members discussed their options regarding references to global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement. In their judgment, these factors, cited in previous postmeeting statements as part of the rationale for adjusting the stance of policy, remained salient fea- tures of the outlook. Accordingly, they agreed to cite them in the sentence indicating that “the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming infor- mation for the economic outlook.” With the retention of these references to global developments and muted inflation pressures, members agreed that the text on un- certainties about the outlook could be removed. A few members suggested that the language stating that mone- tary policy would support inflation “near” 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level; they preferred language that referred to returning inflation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive. Other members thought that the reference to “near” 2 percent was intended to encompass modest de- viations of inflation above and below 2 percent. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 12, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent. In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to main- tain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and overnight repur- chase agreement operations at least through January 2020 to ensure that the supply of re- serves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase opera- tions (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Minutes of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are run- ning below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expec- tations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. The Committee judges that the current stance of monetary pol- icy is appropriate to support sustained expan- sion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of in- coming information for the economic outlook, including global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Richard H. Clarida, Charles L. Evans, Esther L. George, Randal K. Quarles, and Eric S. Rosengren. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 1.55 percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex- isting level of 2.25 percent, effective December 12, 2019. Organizational Matters By unanimous vote, Lorie K. Logan was selected to serve at the pleasure of the Committee as manager, Sys- tem Open Market Account, on the understanding that her selection was subject to being satisfactory to the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York. Secretary’s note: Advice subsequently was re- ceived that the selection of Ms. Logan as man- ager was satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 28–29, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on Decem- ber 11, 2019. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on November 19, 2019, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on October 29–30, 2019. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 10–11, 2019, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on infor- mation available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy— including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer- run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projec- tions represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to con- verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Ap- propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos- ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. Almost all participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth of real GDP in 2020 would run at or slightly above 1.9 percent, the median of current estimates of its longer-run rate. The median of the pro- jections for the growth rate of real GDP edges down each year over the projection horizon and, for 2022, is modestly below the median of the current estimates of its longer-run rate. The median of the current projec- tions for the unemployment rate was lower than that in the September Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for each year of the projection period, and some participants reduced their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, resulting in a slight de- cline in the median estimate. The medians of the pro- jections for both total and core inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), increase sig- nificantly from 2019 to 2020 and more modestly in 2021 to reach 2 percent that year. Almost all participants ex- pected that inflation would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2021 and 2022. A couple more participants, relative to the September SEP, projected inflation to exceed 2 percent at some point 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. during the projection period. The medians of the pro- jections for both total and core inflation were unchanged for 2020 through 2022, compared with the September SEP. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, a substantial majority of partici- pants indicated that their expectations regarding the evo- lution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s ob- jectives of maximum employment and 2 percent infla- tion, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds at its current level through the end of 2020. Compared with the September SEP submissions, the median projection for the federal funds rate was 25 basis points lower in each year over the projection period and retained its modest upward tilt in 2021 and 2022. The median of participants’ assessments of the appropriate level for the federal funds rate in 2022 was slightly below the median of estimates of its longer-run level; the median estimate of the longer-run level was unchanged from its value in the September SEP. Most participants regarded the uncertainties around their projections as broadly similar to the average over the past 20 years. The majority of participants continued to assess the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside. However, compared with the September submissions, several participants shifted their assessments of the balance of risks around these projections to being broadly balanced. Most participants judged the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly bal- anced, though one-third of participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the down- side; no participant assessed the risks to his or her infla- tion outlook as weighted to the upside. The uncertain- ties and risks around participants’ projections for head- line and core inflation were little changed from the Sep- tember SEP. The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and Unemploy- ment As shown in table 1, the medians of participants’ projec- tions for real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020, conditional on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, were 2.2 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, a touch above the median estimate of the longer-run Page 1_____________________________________________________________________________________________ , s t n e d i s e r p k n a B e v r e s e R l a r e d e F d n a s r e b m e m d r a o B e v r e s e R l a r e d e F f o s n o i t c e j o r p c i m o n o c E . 1 e l b a T 9 1 0 2 r e b m e c e D , y c i l o p y r a t e n o m e t a i r p o r p p a d e t c e j o r p f o s n o i t p m u s s a l a u d i v i d n i r i e h t r e d n u r e g n o L n u r n u r 3 e g n a R 2 y c n e d n e T l a r t n e C 1 n a i d e M 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 9 1 0 2 r e g n o L 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 9 1 0 2 r e g n o L 2 2 0 2 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 9 1 0 2 e l b a i r a V t n e c r e P 2 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 2 . 2 – 5 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 2 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 7 . 1 3 . 2 – 1 . 2 4 . 2 – 1 . 2 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 7 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 1 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 1 . 2 3 . 2 – 1 . 2 5 . 4 – 5 . 3 5 . 4 – 6 . 3 1 . 4 – 3 . 3 2 . 4 – 3 . 3 0 . 4 – 3 . 3 1 . 4 – 3 . 3 8 . 3 – 3 . 3 0 . 4 – 3 . 3 6 . 3 – 5 . 3 8 . 3 – 5 . 3 3 . 4 – 9 . 3 3 . 4 – 0 . 4 0 . 4 – 5 . 3 0 . 4 – 7 . 3 9 . 3 – 5 . 3 9 . 3 – 6 . 3 7 . 3 – 5 . 3 8 . 3 – 6 . 3 6 . 3 – 5 . 3 7 . 3 – 6 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 7 . 1 – 4 . 1 7 . 1 – 4 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 2 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 3 . 2 – 8 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 1 . 2 – 7 . 1 8 . 1 – 6 . 1 8 . 1 – 6 . 1 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 2 . 2 – 0 . 2 1 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 9 . 1 – 8 . 1 0 . 2 – 8 . 1 5 . 1 – 4 . 1 6 . 1 – 5 . 1 1 . 2 – 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 – 9 . 1 0 . 2 – 9 . 1 7 . 1 – 6 . 1 8 . 1 – 7 . 1 n u r 9 . 1 9 . 1 1 . 4 2 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 2 8 . 1 8 . 1 7 . 3 9 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 9 . 1 9 . 1 6 . 3 8 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 0 . 2 5 . 3 7 . 3 9 . 1 9 . 1 9 . 1 9 . 1 2 . 2 2 . 2 6 . 3 7 . 3 5 . 1 5 . 1 6 . 1 8 . 1 n o i t c e j o r p r e b m e t p e S P D G l a e r n i e g n a h C n o i t c e j o r p r e b m e t p e S e t a r t n e m y o l p m e n U n o i t c e j o r p r e b m e t p e S n o i t c e j o r p r e b m e t p e S 4 n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P e r o C n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P h t a p y c i l o p e t a i r p o r p p a d e t c e j o r P : o m e M 3 . 3 – 0 . 2 3 . 3 – 0 . 2 9 . 2 – 6 . 1 9 . 2 – 6 . 1 4 . 2 – 6 . 1 6 . 2 – 6 . 1 9 . 1 – 6 . 1 4 . 2 – 6 . 1 6 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 8 . 2 – 4 . 2 8 . 2 – 5 . 2 6 . 2 – 9 . 1 6 . 2 – 9 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 4 . 2 – 6 . 1 9 . 1 – 6 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 6 . 1 1 . 2 – 6 . 1 5 . 2 5 . 2 1 . 2 4 . 2 9 . 1 1 . 2 6 . 1 9 . 1 6 . 1 9 . 1 n o i t c e j o r p r e b m e t p e S e t a r s d n u f l a r e d e F h t r u o f e h t m o r f s e g n a h c t n e c r e p e r a n o i t a ﬂ n i f o s e r u s a e m h t o b r o f s n o i t c e j o r p d n a ) P D G ( t c u d o r p c i t s e m o d s s o r g l a e r n i e g n a h c f o s n o i t c e j o r P : e t o N , y l e v i t c e p s e r , n i e g n a h c f o s e t a r e g a t n e c r e p e h t e r a n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P e r o c d n a n o i t a ﬂ n i E C P . d e t a c i d n i r a e y e h t f o r e t r a u q h t r u o f e h t o t r a e y s u o i v e r p e h t f o r e t r a u q e t a r t n e m y o l p m e n u e h t r o f s n o i t c e j o r P . y g r e n e d n a d o o f i g n d u l c x e E C P r o f x e d n i e c i r p e h t d n a ) E C P ( s e r u t i d n e p x e n o i t p m u s n o c l a n o s r e p r o f x e d n i e c i r p f o t n e m s s e s s a r e h r o s i h n o d e s a b e r a s n o i t c e j o r p s ’ t n a p i c i t r a p h c a E . d e t a c i d n i r a e y e h t f o r e t r a u q h t r u o f e h t n i e t a r t n e m y o l p m e n u n a i l i v i c e g a r e v a e h t r o f e h t e r a e g r e v n o c o t d e t c e p x e e b l d u o w e l b a i r a v h c a e h c i h w o t e t a r e h t f o t n e m s s e s s a s ’ t n a p i c i t r a p h c a e t n e s e r p e r s n o i t c e j o r p n u r -

The median of the projec- tions for the growth rate of real GDP declines slowly over the projection horizon and, in 2022, is modestly be- low the median of the current estimates of its longer-run rate. The medians of the projections for real GDP growth in all four years of the projection period, as well as in the longer run, were unchanged from the Septem- ber SEP. A majority of participants marked down their projec- tions of the unemployment rate in each year of the pro- jection period, and some participants lowered their esti- mates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment. As a result, the medians of the projections for the unem- ployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 through 2022 were 3.5 percent, 3.6 percent, and 3.7 percent, re- spectively, each 0.2 percentage point lower than in the September projections. The median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.1 per- cent, 0.1 percentage point lower than in September. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate, respectively, from 2019 to 2022 and in the longer run. The distribution of individual projec- tions for real GDP growth for 2020 tilted slightly higher, as many participants upgraded their projections a bit rel- ative to those in the September SEP, although the me- dian projection was unchanged. The distributions of in- dividual projections of real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 and in the longer run were little changed overall. The distributions of individual projections for the unem- ployment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run shifted lower relative to those in September. The Outlook for Inflation As shown in table 1, the median projection for core PCE price inflation was 1.6 percent for 2019, a modest de- crease from the September projections. The medians of the projections for both total and core PCE price infla- tion were each 1.9 percent in 2020 and 2.0 percent in both 2021 and 2022—all unchanged from September. Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of partici- pants’ views about their outlooks for inflation. Al- though the medians of the projections for total and core PCE price inflation from 2020 through 2022 were un- changed from the September SEP, a couple more par- ticipants projected inflation to be slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2022. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows the distributions of participants’ judg- ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2019 to 2022 and over the longer run. A substantial majority of participants projected a federal funds rate of 1.63 percent for the end of 2020. Four participants assessed that the most likely appropriate rate at year-end for 2020 would be 1.88 percent. For subse- quent years, the medians of the projections were 1.88 percent at the end of 2021 and 2.13 percent at the end of 2022. The distribution of participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was little changed, and the median estimate was unchanged from September at 2.50 percent. Compared with the projections prepared for the Sep- tember SEP, a number of participants marked down their assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2020, reflecting in part the re- duction in the target range at the October meeting and causing both the range and central tendency of projec- tions for 2020 to narrow considerably. Some partici- pants lowered their projections for the appropriate level in 2021 and 2022. The median projection for the federal funds rate was 25 basis points lower in each year in the projection period. Realized inflation running persis- tently below target and risks associated with trade policy and foreign economic growth were cited as key factors informing participants’ judgments about the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur. As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts display the SEP medians for the three variables sur- rounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the de- gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncer- tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore- cast horizon lengthens.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. A substantial majority of participants viewed the uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic var- iables as being broadly similar to the average over the past 20 years. Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Relative to the September SEP, more participants saw the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly bal- anced, although a small majority continued to view the risks to their outlooks for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and for the unemployment rate as weighted to the upside. Most participants continued to judge the risks to their inflation outlook as broadly bal- anced, while some participants viewed the risks to their inflation outlook as weighted to the downside. No par- ticipant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, some participants mentioned trade developments and concerns about foreign eco- nomic growth as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the U.S. economic growth outlook. In contrast, the underlying strength of both consumer spending and the labor market was cited as balancing the risks around the growth outlook. In addition, most of the participants who shifted their balance of risks for output growth to “broadly balanced” cited more accommodative mone- tary policy as a contributing factor. For the inflation out- look, the possibility that inflation expectations could be drifting below levels consistent with the FOMC’s 2 per- cent inflation objective was viewed as a downside risk. A couple of participants mentioned higher tariffs as a source of upside risk to their inflation outlook. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel- opments over time in key economic variables—such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion—uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly reflects the uncertain- ties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors. Figure 5 provides a graphic represen- tation of this uncertainty, plotting the SEP median for the federal funds rate surrounded by symmetric confi- dence intervals derived from the results presented in ta- ble 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the fed- eral funds rate is substantial and increases for longer ho- rizons.

Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the conﬁdence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as “broadly balanced” would view the conﬁdence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Uncertainty and risks in projections of the federal funds rate Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to onset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. 0123456201420152016201720182019202020212022Midpoint of target rangeMedian of projections70% confidence interval*ActualPercentFederal funds rateSummary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 10–11, 2019Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.4 to 4.6 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the third and fourth years. The corresponding 70 percent con- fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 per- cent in the current year, 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the second year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these con- fidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen- tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. How- ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate can- not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down- side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.
