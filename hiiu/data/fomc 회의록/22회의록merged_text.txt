AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 25, 2022) OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency. SECURITIES LENDING 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). Such securities lending must be: A. i. ii. objectives of the program; At rates determined by competitive bidding; At a minimum lending fee consistent with the _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 3 Subject to reasonable limitations on the total iii. amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and iv. limitations on the amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. Subject to reasonable B. The Selected Bank may: i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 4. market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to: Undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible i. Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Ac- counts for a term of 65 business days or less; and ii. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with Foreign Accounts; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un- der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a service fee when appropriate. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori- zation or approval of other entities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United States Department of the Treasury. ADDITIONAL MATTERS The Committee authorizes the Chair of the Com- 5. mittee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives during any period between meetings of the Committee, to in- struct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Commit- tee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meet- ing of the Committee. The Chair, whenever feasible, will consult with the Committee before making any instruc- tion under this paragraph 5.

These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability. These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members. FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE (As amended effective January 25, 2022) The Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank 1. selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to ex- ecute open market transactions, for the System Open Market Account, in accordance with the provisions of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the “Authorization”) and subject to the limits in this Di- rective. 2.

The Committee directs the Selected Bank to hold and to invest foreign currencies in the portfolio in ac- cordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Au- thorization. 5. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to report to the Committee, at each regular meeting of the Com- mittee, on transactions undertaken pursuant to para- graphs 1 and 6 of the Authorization. The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com- mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur- rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori- zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con- duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera- tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. The Committee voted unanimously to approve with minor revisions the Standing Repurchase Agreement Fa- cility Resolution, as shown below. All but one member of the Committee voted to approve with minor revisions the Standing FIMA Repurchase Agreement Resolution. Governor Bowman abstained from the vote on the Standing FIMA Repurchase Agreement Resolution. The resolutions were modified to remove references to a specific facility rate to allow for normal adjustment in the facility rates when the Committee makes changes to the target range for the federal funds rate. STANDING REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FACIL- ITY RESOLUTION (As amended effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Commit- tee”) authorizes and directs the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”), to conduct operations in which it offers to purchase securities, subject to an agreement to resell (“repurchase agreement transactions”). The repurchase agreement transactions hereby authorized and directed shall (i) include only U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities; (ii) be conducted as open market operations with pri- mary dealers and depository institutions as participants; (iii) be conducted with a minimum bid rate set at a level directed by the Committee; (iv) be offered on an over- night basis (except that the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank may extend the term for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions); and (v) be subject to an ag- gregate operation limit of $500 billion. The aggregate operation limit can be temporarily increased at the dis- cretion of the Chair. These operations shall be con- ducted by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Committee. STANDING FIMA REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RESOLUTION (As amended effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Commit- tee”) authorizes and directs the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Selected Bank”), for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”), to offer to purchase U.S. Treasury securities subject to an agreement to resell (“repurchase agreement transactions”) with foreign central bank and interna- tional accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Accounts”). The repurchase agreement transactions hereby authorized and directed shall (i) in- clude only U.S. Treasury securities; (ii) be conducted with Foreign Accounts approved in advance by the For- eign Currency Subcommittee (the ”Subcommittee”); (iii) be conducted at an offering rate equal to the minimum bid rate for the standing repurchase agreement facility unless the Subcommittee establishes a different offering rate; (iv) be offered on an overnight basis (except that the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank may extend the term for longer than an overnight term to accommo- date weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions); and (v) be subject to a per-counterparty limit of $60 bil- lion per day. The Subcommittee may approve changes in the offering rate, the maturity of the transactions, eli- gible Foreign Accounts counterparties (either by ap- proving or removing account access), and the counter- party limit; and the Subcommittee shall keep the Com- mittee informed of any such changes. These transac- tions shall be undertaken by the Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank until otherwise directed by the Com- mittee. The Open Market Desk at the Selected Bank will also report at least annually to the Committee on facility usage and the list of approved account holders. Regarding the tough and comprehensive ethics rules for senior officials that were announced in October, the Chair indicated that staff were working through com- ments received from policymakers and were aiming to Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ circulate a new draft soon. Noting the urgency in bring- ing the new policy to completion, the Chair proposed that the Committee vote on a final draft as soon in the intermeeting period as possible. In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, all participants supported the statement as written, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm with- out revision. In discussing the statement, the Chair noted that, con- sistent with previous communications, a formal frame- work review would commence in 2024 and conclude in 2025. That timing would allow perspectives on recent events to inform considerations of potential revisions to the framework. STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As reaffirmed effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta- ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci- sions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer- tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society. Employment, inflation, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan- cial disturbances. Monetary policy plays an important role in stabilizing the economy in response to these dis- turbances. The Committee’s primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy is through changes in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee judges that the level of the federal funds rate consistent with maximum employment and price stability over the longer run has declined relative to its historical average. Therefore, the federal funds rate is likely to be con- strained by its effective lower bound more frequently than in the past. Owing in part to the proximity of in- terest rates to the effective lower bound, the Committee judges that downward risks to employment and inflation have increased. The Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar- ket. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to spec- ify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rec- ognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de- termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. The Committee judges that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and mod- erate long-term interest rates and enhance the Commit- tee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances. In order to anchor longer-term inflation expectations at this level, the Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods when inflation has been running persistently be- low 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time. Monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity, employment, and prices with a lag. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks over time to mit- igate shortfalls of employment from the Committee’s as- sessment of its maximum level and deviations of infla- tion from its longer-run goal. Moreover, sustainably achieving maximum employment and price stability de- pends on a stable financial system. Therefore, the Com- mittee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the bal- ance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s employment and inflation objectives are generally complementary. However, under circum- stances in which the Committee judges that the objec- tives are not complementary, it takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employ- ment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate. The Committee intends to review these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organi- zational meeting each January, and to undertake roughly _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 9 every five years a thorough public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. Financial Developments and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of domestic finan- cial market developments over the intermeeting period. Treasury yields rose across the curve, led by higher real yields. Expectations for tighter monetary policy ahead, as well as an easing of COVID-related concerns, were cited as contributing to the increase in yields. The S&P 500 index declined around 5 percent, with sharp moves toward the end of the period, reportedly prompted by concerns about the implications of a tighter path of monetary policy and rising geopolitical risks. Regarding the monetary policy outlook, with data show- ing continuing tightening of labor market conditions and elevated inflationary pressures, policymaker communi- cations were perceived as pointing to an earlier and faster removal of accommodation than market partici- pants had previously expected. Against this backdrop, respondents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys of pri- mary dealers and market participants almost uniformly projected that the Federal Reserve’s net asset purchases would end by mid-March. The median survey projec- tion for the commencement of balance sheet runoff shifted into the third quarter of this year, roughly a year and a half sooner than in the December surveys. Most survey respondents also expected the portfolio to de- cline at a significantly faster pace than they did in De- cember. Expectations for the path of the federal funds rate shifted toward earlier rate increases, and interest rate fu- tures priced in an increase in the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at the March FOMC meeting. On aver- age, respondents to the Desk surveys assigned a roughly 70 percent probability to an increase in the target range in March. The expected path of the federal funds rate in the Desk surveys and derived from interest rate futures also steepened over the period. The median survey pro- jection for the most likely level of the target range at the end of 2024 was about 2 percent, similar to December. Nonetheless, survey respondents attached significant probability to outcomes in which the target range moved up more than indicated by the projected modal path. Changing views about the likely path of the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet following the release of the Decem- ber FOMC minutes seemed to affect longer-term yields. Far forward real yields moved higher over the period, with much of the increase following the release of the minutes for the December FOMC meeting. In addition, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spreads wid- ened notably after having been stable at low levels for the past year, reportedly driven by expectations for an earlier and faster runoff of agency MBS than had been expected. The manager turned next to a discussion of international financial market developments. Sovereign yields in- creased across advanced foreign economies (AFEs), re- portedly driven by receding concerns about the Omi- cron variant, elevated inflation readings, and, relatedly, expectations that central banks would remove policy ac- commodation sooner than had been expected. Several central banks concluded their net asset purchases late last year, and more were expected to do so this year. On the outlook for policy rates, several central banks had either already increased their policy rates or were ex- pected to do so later this year. The manager provided an update on issues related to monetary policy implementation. Reductions in the pace of the Committee’s net asset purchases had pro- ceeded smoothly to date and functioning in Treasury and agency MBS markets remained stable. Regarding the potential for the Committee to reduce System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings in the future, market participants generally anticipated that SOMA redemp- tions could proceed smoothly at a somewhat faster pace than during the previous period of balance sheet reduc- tion from 2017 to 2019. However, some also noted that SOMA redemptions would require significant adjust- ments to private-sector balance sheets, as investors ab- sorb the net increase in Treasury and agency MBS issu- ance to the private sector and money markets transition to lower levels of liquidity, and that these adjustments could take some time. The manager discussed expectations for the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s administered rates in connection with a potential future change in the target range for the federal funds rate. The Desk survey responses suggested expectations for administered rates to be raised by the same increment as the target range for the federal funds rate. The manager noted that the current setting of ad- ministered rates relative to the target range had been working well and anticipated that it could continue to support effective policy implementation following any increase in the target range in coming months, although adjustments could be warranted over time. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Principles for Reducing the Size of the Balance Sheet Participants continued their discussion of topics associ- ated with potential adjustments in the Committee’s pol- icy tools that may be appropriate to support the achieve- ment of sustained strong labor market conditions and a return of inflation to levels consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run 2 percent objective under a wide range of circumstances. At this meeting, participants dis- cussed high-level principles that could be released to the public to describe the Committee’s approach for reduc- ing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. They agreed that the principles would address, at a high level, the sequence of adjustments in the interest rate and bal- ance sheet tools to reduce policy accommodation, the Committee’s approach to balance sheet runoff, and its intentions for the longer-run size and composition of the balance sheet. The participants’ discussion was pre- ceded by a staff presentation that reviewed key consid- erations raised by participants at the December FOMC meeting and examined how the proposed set of princi- ples, which reflected those considerations, compared with the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is- sued in 2014. In their discussion, participants reaffirmed that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the Com- mittee’s primary means for adjusting the stance of mon- etary policy, as noted in the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Par- ticipants judged that the timing and pace of balance sheet reduction would be determined so as to promote the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-sta- bility goals and that it would be appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet after the process of increasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun. While participants agreed that de- tails on the timing and pace of balance sheet runoff would be determined at upcoming meetings, participants generally noted that current economic and financial con- ditions would likely warrant a faster pace of balance sheet runoff than during the period of balance sheet re- duction from 2017 to 2019. Participants observed that, in light of the current high level of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, a significant reduction in the size of the balance sheet would likely be appropriate. Partici- pants noted that the level of securities holdings con- sistent with implementing monetary policy efficiently and effectively in an ample reserves regime was uncer- tain and probably would remain so. Consequently, mar- ket conditions would have to be monitored closely to determine the appropriate longer-run level of reserves and the size of the balance sheet. Participants agreed that the Committee should reduce the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securi- ties held in the SOMA. They also agreed that the SOMA should hold primarily Treasury securities in the longer run. Regarding these two principles, many participants commented that sales of agency MBS or reinvesting some portion of principal payments received from agency MBS into Treasury securities may be appropriate at some point in the future to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composition con- sisting primarily of Treasury securities. Participants agreed that it was appropriate at this time for the Committee to publish its high-level principles for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. They also agreed that it was important for the Commit- tee to retain the flexibility to adjust any of the details of its approach in light of changing economic and financial conditions. Participants noted that the principles would serve as an important guide in future deliberations on balance sheet reduction. While no decisions regarding specific details for reducing the size of the balance sheet were made at this meeting, participants agreed to con- tinue their discussions at upcoming meetings. Following the conclusion of the discussion, all partici- pants supported the proposed principles for reducing the size of the balance sheet. The Committee voted unanimously to adopt the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, as shown below. PRINCIPLES FOR REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE’S BALANCE SHEET (As adopted effective January 25, 2022) The Federal Open Market Committee agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide information regard- ing its planned approach for significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. All partici- pants agreed on the following elements: • The Committee views changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its pri- mary means of adjusting the stance of mon- etary policy. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 11 • The Committee will determine the timing and pace of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet so as to promote its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee expects that reduc- ing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet will commence after the process of in- creasing the target range for the federal funds rate has begun. • The Committee intends to reduce the Fed- eral Reserve's securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjust- ing the amounts reinvested of principal pay- ments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA). • Over time, the Committee intends to main- tain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime. • In the longer run, the Committee intends to hold primarily Treasury securities in the SOMA, thereby minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy. • The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of eco- nomic and financial developments. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the January 25– 26 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) growth had picked up in the fourth quarter after slowing in the third quarter. Labor market condi- tions improved further in December, and indicators of labor compensation continued to show robust increases. Consumer price inflation through November—as meas- ured by the 12-month percentage change in the price in- dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—re- mained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a moderate gain in December. The unemployment rate declined from 4.2 percent in November to 3.9 percent in Decem- ber. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved higher, and the Hispanic unemployment rate de- clined; both rates remained well above the national aver- age. The labor force participation rate was unchanged in December, and the employment-to-population ratio moved up. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, moved down in November but remained well above pre-pandemic levels; the quits rate was also elevated. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls, constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP that were available through the first half of January, pointed to a slower pace of private employ- ment gains relative to December. Average hourly earn- ings rose at an annual rate of 6.2 percent over the last three months of the year; although wage increases were widespread across industries, they were particularly no- table in the leisure and hospitality sector as well as the transportation and warehousing sector. Inflation readings remained high, and various indicators suggested that inflationary pressures had broadened over the second half of 2021. Total PCE price inflation was 5.7 percent over the 12 months ending in Novem- ber, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.7 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.8 percent in November, 1 percentage point higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In December, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.0 percent, while core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent over the same period. The staff’s common inflation ex- pectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its 2014 average. Real PCE was unchanged in November, and available indicators—including the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE—pointed to a de- cline in December, possibly reflecting the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the second half of that month as well as some holiday sales having been pulled forward to earlier months. Housing demand remained strong, and available indicators suggested that residential investment increased in the fourth quarter. However, shortages of construction materials, buildable lots, and other inputs continued to weigh on activity in this sector. Business fixed investment appeared to post only a small gain in the fourth quarter, as investment in transporta- tion equipment was held back by supply bottlenecks and limited supplies of construction materials restrained nonresidential structures investment. Manufacturing output moved down in December after advancing strongly in October and November. Motor Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ vehicle assemblies reversed some of their November in- crease; in addition, manufacturing production outside of motor vehicles ticked lower. Total real government purchases appeared to have fallen in the fourth quarter. Although available data suggested that real federal purchases rose, indicators of real state and local government purchases pointed to a decline in the fourth quarter despite state and local governments’ extremely strong budget positions and the widespread return to in-person schooling last fall. The U.S. international trade deficit widened at the end of last year. Imports of goods rose sharply in November and December, led by increases in consumer goods, while exports of goods were little changed over the two months, on net, after surging in October. Shipping con- gestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods. Meanwhile, services exports jumped in November, reflecting a sizable increase in ex- ports of travel services after the reopening of U.S. bor- ders to vaccinated foreign travelers early in the month. Even so, services trade was very low relative to pre-pan- demic norms, largely because the level of international travel remained depressed. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth picked up in the fourth quarter of 2021 as economies in emerging Asia bounced back from lockdowns in the third quarter induced by the Delta variant of the COVID-19 virus. Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) pointed to improved supplier delivery times, and foreign vehicle production rose notably, suggesting that supply bottlenecks continued to ease somewhat. However, the rapid spread of the Omicron variant led to renewed pub- lic health restrictions in several countries, particularly in China, and appeared to be weighing on activity at the start of the year. Inflation abroad continued to rise, mostly driven by further increases in retail energy prices, effects from supply bottlenecks, and, in some emerging market economies (EMEs), by rising food prices. That said, input and output price components of PMIs pro- vided some tentative signs that easing supply constraints have started to contribute to some letup in inflationary pressures in several foreign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, easing concerns around the economic effects of the Omicron variant and FOMC communications that were viewed as less accommoda- tive than expected contributed to increases in Treasury yields. Long-term sovereign yields in AFEs also rose no- tably. Broad domestic equity indexes decreased mark- edly, and spreads of corporate bonds widened modestly. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participa- tion in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased further. Market-based fi- nancing conditions remained accommodative, and bank lending standards eased for most loan categories. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—rose notably since the December FOMC meeting, apparently reflecting less-accommoda- tive-than-expected FOMC communications and an eas- ing of concerns around the economic effects of the Omicron variant. Those factors also contributed to no- table rises in 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields. Inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities rose slightly, on net. Broad equity indexes decreased markedly, on net, partic- ularly in the latter part of the intermeeting period, as shifts in expectations about the pace of monetary policy tightening, global inflationary pressures, and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine weighed on equity prices. The one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased considerably, on net, to above the 90th percentile of its historical distribution. Spreads of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened modestly. Spreads of municipal bonds were roughly unchanged. Short-term funding markets were stable over the inter- meeting period. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. Partic- ipation in ON RRP operations averaged $1.6 trillion, about $150 billion higher than during the previous inter- meeting period, and reached an all-time high of $1.9 tril- lion at year-end. Government money market funds con- tinued to receive investment inflows and accounted for the majority of ON RRP take-up. Over the intermeeting period, movements in foreign as- set prices responded to waning concerns about the Omi- cron variant’s potential economic effects and firming views that monetary accommodation in several ad- vanced economies will be removed at a faster pace than previously expected. Some market participants also pointed to rising geopolitical tensions related to Russia as contributing to the moves. On net, AFE sovereign yields increased notably, most major foreign equity in- dexes declined moderately, and the broad dollar index decreased modestly. EME sovereign spreads widened, and capital flows into EME-dedicated bond funds re- mained slightly negative, while flows into EME equity funds turned positive. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 13 In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained broadly accommodative. Gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained solid but slowed somewhat in December, re- flecting seasonal factors. Equity funding raised through initial public offerings continued at a strong pace in No- vember and December, while equity issuance through special purpose acquisition companies remained muted relative to earlier in 2021. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans expanded over the fourth quarter following more than a year of de- clines. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Sur- vey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks re- ported easier standards and stronger demand for C&I loans over the fourth quarter. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations re- mained strong over the intermeeting period. The vol- umes of nonfinancial corporate bond and leveraged loan upgrades exceeded those of downgrades in November and December. Trailing default rates on nonfinancial bonds edged down further to historical lows, while mar- ket indicators of future expected default rates remained benign and historically low. In the municipal bond market, financing conditions re- mained accommodative, as municipal bond yields stayed near historical lows. Issuance of municipal debt was strong in November and December. The credit quality of municipal debt remained stable, and the volume of defaults stayed low. Financing conditions for small businesses eased a bit over the intermeeting period. In the January SLOOS, small banks reported easing C&I loan standards to small firms over the fourth quarter. Loan originations to small businesses rose in November to near pre-pandemic lev- els. Banks in the January SLOOS reported stronger loan demand by small firms over the fourth quarter, though loan demand remained weak overall. Commercial real estate (CRE) loan balances on banks’ books expanded at a solid pace in the fourth quarter, and, in the January SLOOS, banks reported an easing of standards on such loans amid stronger demand for most CRE loan categories. Issuance of non-agency commer- cial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) surged in the fourth quarter, while issuance of agency CMBS slowed. Delinquency rates on mortgages in CMBS pools contin- ued to fall but remained elevated for hotel and retail mortgages. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained accommodative, particularly for borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. In the Jan- uary SLOOS, banks reported easing lending standards for most mortgage categories in the fourth quarter. Mortgage rates increased over the intermeeting period in line with rates on agency MBS and 10-year Treasury se- curities but remained low by historical standards. The fraction of mortgage borrowers missing payments con- tinued to decline through November. Financing conditions for consumer credit remained ac- commodative for most borrowers, especially those with higher credit scores. Lending standards for nonprime consumers in the credit card market continued to ease from the tight levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Banks reported in the January SLOOS that demand for credit card loans strengthened over the fourth quarter, while lending standards eased for auto loans amid a weakening in demand. With sales running low because of con- strained supply, auto loan growth continued to slow in October and November from the more rapid pace rec- orded in the first half of the year. The staff provided an update on its assessments of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained elevated. In particular, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 index stood at the upper end of its historical distribution; high-yield corporate bond spreads and the excess loan premium for leveraged loans remained at low levels; and house prices grew strongly, with price-to-rent ratios that were at ele- vated levels. The staff noted that the market capitaliza- tion of crypto-assets had grown significantly over the past decade and had experienced considerable volatility, including sizable declines since late last year. The staff changed its assessment of vulnerabilities associated with nonfinancial leverage from notable to moderate, noting that measures of business leverage had declined to pre- pandemic levels. Household delinquency rates remained relatively low, while household borrowing rose but was concentrated among prime borrowers. Vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage remained moderate. Risk-based capital ratios for banks remained above their pre-pandemic levels even after the resumption of share- holder payouts. In contrast, some available measures of hedge fund leverage continued to increase, and im- portant data gaps continued to limit a full assessment of vulnerabilities posed by many nonbank financial institu- tions. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were characterized as moderate. Prime and tax-exempt money funds continued to have structural vulnerabilities that may lead investors to withdraw funds quickly in a Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ stress situation and were a potential source of spillovers to other short-term funding markets. In response, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed reforms in December 2021 to make these funds more resilient. Another vulnerability in funding markets was the signif- icant growth in stablecoin arrangements over the past few years, which may increase challenges related to run risk and pose additional risks from their potential role as a means of payment. Staff Economic Outlook The near-term projection for U.S. economic activity pre- pared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was weaker than in December, reflecting the sharp rise in COVID-19 infections caused by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and an assessment that supply con- straints would resolve more slowly than previously ex- pected. Although real GDP still appeared to have posted a sizable gain in the fourth quarter of 2021, out- put growth was expected to slow noticeably in the first quarter of 2022 before picking up again later in the year as COVID-19 cases declined and supply issues contin- ued to be resolved. With most of the boost to growth from the reopening of the economy and easing of supply constraints expected to occur in 2022, real GDP growth was projected to step down in 2023 and to be roughly in line with potential growth in 2023 and 2024. However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential throughout the projection period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight. The staff’s near-term projection for PCE price inflation was revised up relative to December in response to the anticipated slower resolution of supply issues. In partic- ular, the staff continued to expect that monthly inflation rates would move lower as supply constraints eased, but the projected step-down was less pronounced than in the December forecast. Even so, an improvement in supply conditions and a decline in consumer energy prices were expected to slow PCE price inflation to 2.6 percent in 2022. With supply conditions expected to normalize further but with the labor market expected to remain very tight, PCE price inflation was projected to decline to 2 percent in 2023 before edging up to 2.1 per- cent in 2024. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for economic activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. In particular, the possibility that the economic effects of the virus would turn out to be larger than assumed in the baseline projection was viewed as an important source of downside risk to activ- ity, while the possibility of more severe and more persis- tent supply issues was viewed as an additional downside risk to activity and as an upside risk to inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but continued to be affected by the re- cent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the econ- omy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions had remained ac- commodative, in part reflecting policy measures to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. Participants judged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of sup- ply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remained, including from new variants of the virus. With regard to the economic outlook, participants agreed that the Omicron wave of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the first quarter of 2022. Indeed, sectors of the economy that are particularly sen- sitive to pandemic-related disruptions, including travel, leisure, and restaurants, were experiencing sharp reduc- tions in activity as a result of the Omicron wave. Partic- ipants commented that, for many afflicted individuals and families, the virus continued to cause great hardship. Participants concurred that if the Omicron wave dissi- pated quickly, then economic activity would likely strengthen rapidly and economic growth for 2022 as a whole would be robust. Participants cited strong house- hold balance sheets, rising wages, and effective adapta- tion to the pandemic by the business sector as factors supporting the outlook for strong growth this year. However, a number of participants noted that there was a risk that additional variants could weigh on economic activity this year. Participants noted that supply chain bottlenecks and la- bor shortages had continued to limit businesses’ ability to meet strong demand, with these challenges exacer- bated by the emergence and spread of the Omicron var- iant. In particular, the Omicron wave had led to much _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 15 more widespread worker absences due to illness, virus exposure, or caregiving needs, which had curtailed activ- ity in many sectors including airlines, trucking, and ware- housing. Some participants reported that their business contacts were hopeful that the effects of the Omicron wave would be relatively short lived. Nevertheless, sev- eral participants reported that their contacts expected the ongoing labor shortages and other supply constraints to persist well after the acute effects of the Omicron wave had waned. Participants’ contacts also reported continued widespread input cost pressures, which, amid generally robust demand, they reported having largely been able to pass on to their customers. A few partici- pants commented that agricultural businesses were ex- periencing higher input costs, and those higher costs were putting strain on the finances of those firms even as they experienced generally strong demand for their products. In their discussion of the household sector, many partic- ipants noted that the onset of the Omicron wave had damped consumer demand, particularly for services, with much of the recent weakness concentrated in high- contact sectors such as travel, dining, and leisure and hospitality. Almost all of those participants anticipated that household demand would recover briskly if the Omicron wave subsided quickly, with spending sup- ported by strong household balance sheets that were bolstered by high rates of saving earlier in the pandemic and ongoing robust gains in labor income. Participants noted that the labor market had made re- markable progress in recovering from the recession as- sociated with the pandemic and, by most measures, was now very strong. Increases in employment had been solid in recent months; the unemployment rate had de- clined sharply, reaching 3.9 percent in December; job openings and quits were near record high levels; and nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in decades. Several participants commented that the gains, on bal- ance, over recent months had been broad based, with notable improvements for lower-wage workers as well as African Americans and Hispanics. Against this back- drop of a generally strong and improving labor market, many participants observed that the effects of the Omi- cron variant likely would only temporarily suppress the rate of labor market gains. The labor force participation rate had edged up further over the past few months, and some participants indicated that they expected it to con- tinue to increase as the pandemic eased. A couple of participants noted that the participation rate remained lower than trend levels that account for changing de- mographics. Participants noted that their District contacts were re- porting that labor demand remained historically strong and that labor supply remained constrained, resulting in a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy. As a result, there was widespread evidence that the labor market was very tight, including near-rec- ord rates of quits and job vacancies as well as nominal wage growth that was the highest recorded in decades. Several participants reported that District business con- tacts were either planning to implement or had imple- mented larger wage increases than those of recent years to retain current employees or attract new workers. A few participants also reported contacts having been forced to reduce operating hours or close businesses temporarily because of labor shortages. Acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability evolves over time, partici- pants expressed a range of views regarding their assess- ments of current labor market conditions relative to the Committee’s goal of maximum employment. Many par- ticipants commented that they viewed labor market con- ditions as already at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment, citing indications of strong labor markets including the low levels of unemployment rates, elevated wage pressures, near-record levels of job openings and quits, and a broad shortage of workers across many parts of the economy. A couple of partici- pants commented that, in their view, the economy likely had not yet reached maximum employment, noting that, even for prime-age workers, labor force participation rates were still lower than those that prevailed before the pandemic or that a reallocation of labor across sectors could lead to higher levels of employment over time. Participants remarked that recent inflation readings had continued to significantly exceed the Committee’s longer-run goal and elevated inflation was persisting longer than they had anticipated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the re- opening of the economy. However, some participants commented that elevated inflation had broadened be- yond sectors most directly affected by those factors, bol- stered in part by strong consumer demand. In addition, various participants cited other developments that had the potential to place additional upward pressure on in- flation, including real wage growth in excess of produc- tivity growth and increases in prices for housing services. Participants acknowledged that elevated inflation was a burden on U.S. households, particularly those who were least able to pay higher prices for essential goods and services. Some participants reported that their business Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ contacts remained concerned about persistently high in- flation and that they were adjusting their business prac- tices to cope with higher input costs—for instance, by raising output prices or utilizing contracts that were con- tingent on their costs. Participants generally expected inflation to moderate over the course of the year as sup- ply and demand imbalances ease and monetary policy accommodation is removed. Some participants re- marked that longer-term measures of inflation expecta- tions appeared to remain well anchored, which would support a return of inflation over time to levels con- sistent with the Committee’s goals. In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside. Participants cited several such risks, includ- ing the zero-tolerance COVID-19 policy in China that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains, the possibility of geopolitical turmoil that could cause in- creases in global energy prices or exacerbate global sup- ply shortages, a worsening of the pandemic, persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity growth that could trigger inflationary wage–price dynamics, or the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored. A few participants pointed to the possibility that structural factors that had contributed to low inflation in the previous decade, such as technolog- ical changes, demographics, and a low real interest rate environment, may reemerge when the effects of the pan- demic abate. Uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated. Various participants noted downside risks to the outlook, including a possible worsening of the pandemic, the potential for escalating geopolitical tensions, or a substantial tightening in financial condi- tions. Participants who commented on issues related to finan- cial stability cited a number of factors that could repre- sent potential vulnerabilities to the financial system. A few participants noted that asset valuations were ele- vated across a range of markets and raised the concern that a major realignment of asset prices could contribute to a future downturn. A couple of these participants judged that prolonged accommodative financial condi- tions could be contributing to financial imbalances. A couple of other participants cited reasons why elevated asset valuations might prove to be less of a threat to fi- nancial stability than in past reversals of asset prices. In particular, they noted the relatively healthy balance sheet positions of households and nonfinancial firms, the well- capitalized and liquid banking sector, and the fact that the rise in housing prices was not being fueled by a large increase in mortgage debt as suggesting that the financial system might prove resilient to shocks. Some partici- pants saw emerging risks to financial stability associated with the rapid growth in crypto-assets and decentralized finance platforms. A few participants pointed to risks associated with highly leveraged, nonbank financial in- stitutions or the potential vulnerability of prime money market funds to a sudden withdrawal of liquidity. In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the Committee to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent in support of the Committee’s ob- jectives of maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. They also antici- pated that it would soon be appropriate to raise the tar- get range. In discussing why beginning to remove policy accommodation could soon be warranted, participants noted that inflation continued to run well above 2 per- cent and generally judged the risks to the outlook for in- flation as tilted to the upside. Participants also assessed that the labor market was strong, having made substan- tial, broad-based progress over the past year. In light of elevated inflation pressures and the strong la- bor market, participants continued to judge that the Committee’s net asset purchases should be concluded soon. Most participants preferred to continue to reduce the Committee’s net asset purchases according to the schedule announced in December, bringing them to an end in early March. A couple of participants stated that they favored ending the Committee’s net asset purchases sooner to send an even stronger signal that the Commit- tee was committed to bringing down inflation. Participants discussed the implications of the economic outlook for the likely timing and pace for removing pol- icy accommodation. Compared with conditions in 2015 when the Committee last began a process of removing monetary policy accommodation, participants viewed that there was a much stronger outlook for growth in economic activity, substantially higher inflation, and a notably tighter labor market. Consequently, most par- ticipants suggested that a faster pace of increases in the target range for the federal funds rate than in the post- 2015 period would likely be warranted, should the econ- omy evolve generally in line with the Committee’s ex- pectation. Even so, participants emphasized that the ap- propriate path of policy would depend on economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook and the risks around the outlook, and they will be updating their assessments of the appropriate setting for the policy stance at each meeting. Participants noted _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 17 that the removal of policy accommodation in current cir- cumstances depended on the timing and pace of both increases in the target range of the federal funds rate and the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. In this context, a number of participants com- mented that conditions would likely warrant beginning to reduce the size of the balance sheet sometime later this year. In their discussion of the outlook for monetary policy, many participants noted the influence on financial con- ditions of the Committee’s recent communications and viewed these communications as helpful in shifting pri- vate-sector expectations regarding the policy outlook into better alignment with the Committee’s assessment of appropriate policy. Participants continued to stress that maintaining flexibility to implement appropriate policy adjustments on the basis of risk-management considerations should be a guiding principle in conduct- ing policy in the current highly uncertain environment. Most participants noted that, if inflation does not move down as they expect, it would be appropriate for the Committee to remove policy accommodation at a faster pace than they currently anticipate. Some participants commented on the risk that financial conditions might tighten unduly in response to a rapid removal of policy accommodation. A few participants remarked that this risk could be mitigated through clear and effective com- munication of the Committee’s assessments of the eco- nomic outlook, the risks around the outlook, and the ap- propriate path for monetary policy. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. They noted that the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic had improved in recent months but were being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains had been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Members remarked that supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy had continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions remained accommodative, in part reflect- ing policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Mem- bers also acknowledged that the path of the economy continued to depend on the course of the virus. Pro- gress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints were expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in infla- tion, but risks to the economic outlook remained, in- cluding from new variants of the virus. In order to support the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability objectives, members agreed to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, members expected that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the fed- eral funds rate. Members agreed to continue to reduce the monthly pace of the Committee’s net asset pur- chases, bringing them to an end in early March. Specif- ically, beginning in February, the Committee would in- crease its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency MBS by at least $10 billion per month. Members noted that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing asset purchases and holdings of secu- rities would continue to foster smooth market function- ing and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members agreed to remove the opening sentence from previous postmeeting statements regarding using the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools to support the U.S. economy. This language was adopted during the height of the financial market turmoil in March 2020, when the Committee began its asset purchase program, and mem- bers acknowledged that it was no longer warranted in light of the strong economy as well as the Committee’s announcement that net asset purchases would end in early March. Members agreed that the postmeeting statement should be updated to reflect the Committee’s expectation that it would soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in light of ele- vated inflation pressures and the strong labor market. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute Page 18Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: The vote also encompassed approval of the state- ment below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 27, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. • Complete the increase in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of Treasury securities by $40 billion and of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) by $20 billion, as indicated in the monthly purchase plans released in mid-January. • • Increase the SOMA holdings of Treasury securities by $20 billion and of agency MBS by $10 billion, during the monthly purchase period beginning in mid-February. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by additional amounts as needed to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.05 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” “Indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have continued to strengthen. The sec- tors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but are being affected by the recent sharp rise in COVID-19 cases. Job gains have been solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has de- clined substantially. Supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have continued to contribute to elevated levels of inflation. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part re- flecting policy measures to support the econ- omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus. Progress on vaccina- tions and an easing of supply constraints are ex- pected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook re- main, including from new variants of the virus. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. With inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March. Beginning in February, the Com- mittee will increase its holdings of Treasury se- curities by at least $20 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $10 billion per month. The Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases and holdings of securities will continue to foster smooth market function- ing and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to house- holds and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 25–26, 2022Page 19 policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals.

Raskin, Andrea Tambalotti, and Benedict Wensley,2 Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of New York, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, New York, and New York, respectively Seth Searls,2 Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Karel Mertens, Senior Economic Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Justin Meyer,2 Markets Officer, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of global financial market developments. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent imposition of an array of sanctions, the ruble depreciated roughly 40 percent against the dollar. Prices of dollar-denominated Russian bonds plunged 80 to 90 percent, and local trading of Russian equities was suspended after a precipitous de- cline in Russian stock price indexes. Global financial conditions tightened, reflecting declines in equity prices, increases in sovereign yields and credit spreads, and— for the United States—an appreciation of the dollar. Prices of commodities that Russia exports, particularly oil and natural gas, soared over the period. While oil prices partially retraced late in the period, options prices suggested considerable probability that oil prices could remain elevated or rise further in the months ahead. Alongside the rise in commodities prices, measures of near-term inflation compensation increased sharply across advanced economies. In Eastern European countries, currencies depreciated notably and equity prices declined, but most emerging market currencies outside of Eastern Europe depreciated only modestly or rose. Sovereign spreads for emerging market economies (EMEs) widened, but the moves outside of Eastern Eu- rope were relatively modest. The developments in Ukraine sparked some liquidity strains across markets. Overnight interest rates were steady throughout the period, but there were some signs of pressures in term funding markets. High levels of re- serves in the banking system and the backstop facilities Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in place—the new repurchase agreement facility for for- eign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility) and the standing repo facility (SRF), as well as the standing central bank liquidity swap lines and the dis- count window—likely supported market confidence re- garding the availability of liquidity and helped contain funding pressures. Amid a rise in market volatility, trad- ing liquidity declined across a number of sectors. In the Treasury market, market depth fell and the price impact of trades increased modestly in some sectors. Overall, however, volumes were typical, and markets continued to function in an orderly fashion. Notwithstanding uncertainties associated with geopolit- ical developments, many central banks continued to sig- nal intentions to move ahead with reducing policy ac- commodation to address elevated inflation. Market- implied policy rates one year forward rose notably across many advanced foreign economies (AFEs), extending increases seen over recent months. In the United States, incoming economic data and Fed- eral Reserve communications led investors to expect a more rapid removal of policy accommodation than they had previously expected. Market participants almost universally expected a 25 basis point increase in the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at the current meet- ing. Moreover, futures prices implied that the federal funds rate would increase around 170 basis points through year-end, about 70 basis points more than had been priced in at the time of the January meeting. Simi- larly, the median projection of the target range for the federal funds rate in the Open Market Desk’s most re- cent surveys of primary dealers and market participants showed an increase of 150 basis points this year. The median projected path for the target range beyond 2022 rose another 100 basis points by the first half of 2024 to a level modestly above the median projected longer-run level before returning closer to the longer-run level in 2025. Consistent with shifting expectations for the path of policy, shorter-dated Treasury yields rose notably over the intermeeting period and the spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and 2-year Treasury yield nar- rowed. Market participants expected an earlier and somewhat faster reduction in System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of securities than they did in January. In the Desk surveys, almost 90 percent of respondents projected balance sheet runoff to begin by July. Overall, survey respondents expected a significant reduction in the balance sheet over coming years, although there was a high degree of uncertainty around the magnitude of the total decline. The manager turned next to a discussion of money mar- kets and policy implementation. Market participants ex- pected the interest on reserve balances rate and over- night reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offering rate to be increased by 25 basis points at the current meeting, in line with their expected increase in the target range, and anticipated that the changes would fully pass through to market overnight interest rates. There was uncertainty around how ON RRP usage might evolve in the near term as money market rates increased. If banks lifted their deposit rates by less than the increase in re- turns available on alternative investments, depositors could shift funds into these alternatives, leading to downward pressure on rates and increased ON RRP take-up. If instead deposit rates moved up in line with net yields on alternative investments, ON RRP takeup could remain relatively steady. Over the longer term, however, ON RRP balances were expected to decline as the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet runoff proceeded and gradually lifted money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate. Turning to Desk operations, the manager noted that the Desk would be maintaining the size of the SOMA port- folio through reinvestments until the Committee di- rected otherwise. For Treasury securities, the Desk would follow the usual practice of rolling over all princi- pal payments at auctions. In the absence of regular sec- ondary-market purchases of Treasury securities, the Desk planned to maintain operational readiness by con- ducting small-value purchases and sales of Treasury se- curities. For agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), the Desk planned to continue to reinvest principal pay- ments on a monthly basis through secondary-market purchases. The manager discussed a plan to simplify ad- ministrative aspects of the SOMA holdings of agency MBS in coming months through a process of CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Proce- dures) aggregation. The Desk undertook similar pro- grams of CUSIP aggregation following the conclusion of previous large-scale asset purchase programs; these past CUSIP aggregation programs were successful at reduc- ing the cost and complexity of maintaining agency MBS holdings. Finally, the manager provided an update on the SRF. The Desk had onboarded four depository institutions as counterparties and noted that a number of additional banks were currently under review. The Desk planned to adjust the counterparty eligibility requirements in Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ early April to make the SRF accessible to a broader range of banks, in line with the Committee’s intention to ex- pand eligibility over time and with efforts to ensure that Desk counterparty policies promote a fair and competi- tive marketplace. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Plans for Reducing the Size of the Balance Sheet Participants continued their discussion of topics related to plans for reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in a manner consistent with the approach described in the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Committee re- leased following its January meeting. The participants’ discussion was preceded by a staff presentation that reviewed the Committee’s 2017–19 ex- perience with balance sheet reduction and presented a range of possible options for reducing the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner. All of the options featured a more rapid pace of balance sheet runoff than in the 2017–19 episode. The options differed primarily with respect to the size of the monthly caps for securities redemptions in the SOMA portfolio. The presentation addressed the po- tential implications of each option for the path of the balance sheet during and after runoff. The staff presen- tation also featured alternative approaches the Commit- tee could consider with respect to SOMA holdings of Treasury bills as well as alternative ways the Committee could eventually slow and then stop balance sheet runoff as the size of the SOMA portfolio approached levels consistent with the Committee’s ample-reserves frame- work for policy implementation. In their discussion, all participants agreed that elevated inflation and tight labor market conditions warranted commencement of balance sheet runoff at a coming meeting, with a faster pace of decline in securities hold- ings than over the 2017–19 period. Participants reaf- firmed that the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings should be reduced over time in a predictable manner pri- marily by adjusting the amounts reinvested of principal payments received from securities held in the SOMA. Principal payments received from securities held in the SOMA would be reinvested to the extent they exceeded monthly caps. Several participants remarked that they would be comfortable with relatively high monthly caps or no caps. Some other participants noted that monthly caps for Treasury securities should take into considera- tion potential risks to market functioning. Participants generally agreed that monthly caps of about $60 billion for Treasury securities and about $35 billion for agency MBS would likely be appropriate. Participants also gen- erally agreed that the caps could be phased in over a pe- riod of three months or modestly longer if market con- ditions warrant. Participants discussed the approach toward implement- ing caps for Treasury securities and the role that the Fed- eral Reserve’s holdings of Treasury bills might play in the Committee’s plan to reduce the size of the balance sheet. Most participants judged that it would be appropriate to redeem coupon securities up to the cap amount each month and to redeem Treasury bills in months when Treasury coupon principal payments were below the cap. Under this approach, redemption of Treasury bills would typically bring the total amount of Treasury re- demptions up to the monthly cap. Several participants remarked that reducing the Federal Reserve’s Treasury bill holdings over time would be appropriate because Treasury bills are highly valued as safe and liquid assets by the private sector, and the Treasury could increase bill issuance to the public as SOMA bill holdings decline. In addition, participants generally noted that maintaining large holdings of Treasury bills is not necessary under the Federal Reserve’s ample-reserves operating frame- work; in the previous scarce-reserves regime, Treasury bill holdings were useful as a tool that could be used to drain reserves from the banking system when necessary to control short-term interest rates. A couple of partic- ipants commented that holding some Treasury bills could be appropriate if the Federal Reserve wished to keep its Treasury portfolio neutral with respect to the universe of outstanding Treasury securities. With respect to the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS re- demptions, participants generally noted that MBS prin- cipal prepayments would likely run under the proposed monthly cap in a range of plausible interest rate scenar- ios but that the cap could guard against outsized reduc- tions in the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS holdings in scenarios with especially high prepayments. Some par- ticipants noted that under the proposed approach to running off Treasury and agency securities primarily through adjustments to reinvestments, agency MBS holdings would still make up a sizable share of the Fed- eral Reserve’s asset holdings for many years. Partici- pants generally agreed that after balance sheet runoff was well under way, it will be appropriate to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Treasury securities. A Committee decision to implement a program of agency MBS sales would be announced well in advance. Several participants noted the significant uncertainty around the future level of reserves that would be con- sistent with the Committee’s ample-reserves operating framework. Against this backdrop, participants gener- ally agreed that it would be appropriate to first slow and then stop the decline in the size of the balance sheet when reserve balances were above the level the Commit- tee judged to be consistent with ample reserves, thereby allowing reserves to decline more gradually as nonre- serve liabilities increased over time. Participants agreed that lessons learned from the previous balance sheet re- duction episode should inform the Committee’s current approach to reaching ample reserve levels and that close monitoring of money market conditions and indicators of near-ample reserves should help inform adjustments to the pace of runoff. A couple of participants noted that the establishment of the SRF, which did not exist in the previous runoff episode, could address unexpected money market pressures that might emerge if the Com- mittee adopted an approach to balance sheet reduction in which reserves declined relatively rapidly, but several others noted that the facility was not intended as a sub- stitute for ample reserves. Participants generally agreed that it was important for the Committee to be prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments. No decision regarding the Committee’s plan to reduce the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was made at this meeting, but participants agreed they had made substan- tial progress on the plan and that the Committee was well placed to begin the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet as early as after the conclusion of its upcoming meeting in May. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the March 15– 16 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) was increasing in the first quarter at a pace that was slower than the rapid gain posted in the fourth quarter of 2021. Labor market conditions improved fur- ther in January and February, and indicators of labor compensation continued to show robust increases. Consumer price inflation through January—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—re- mained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment grew strongly in Jan- uary and February. The unemployment rate edged down, on net, from 3.9 percent in December to 3.8 per- cent in February. The unemployment rate for African Americans and for Hispanics declined over this period; however, both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate in- creased in February, as did the employment-to-popula- tion ratio. The private-sector job openings rate in Janu- ary, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, was little changed, on net, from its Novem- ber level and remained well above its pre-pandemic level; the quits rate also remained elevated. Average hourly earnings rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in February, about the same as its year-earlier pace, with widespread increases across industries. Consumer prices continued to rise rapidly. Total PCE price inflation was 6.1 percent over the 12 months end- ing in January, and core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.2 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las was 3.5 percent in January, 1.8 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 7.9 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.4 percent over the same period. The staff’s common inflation ex- pectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, had largely leveled off over the fall and was close to its 2014 average. Real PCE appeared to be rising at a faster pace in the first quarter of 2022 than in the fourth quarter of 2021 as social distancing unwound further. Housing demand remained strong, though activity in the residential hous- ing sector continued to be restrained by shortages of construction materials, buildable lots, and other inputs. Available indicators suggested that growth in business fixed investment was picking up in the first quarter as growth in nonresidential structures investment turned positive. Available data suggested that motor vehicle production declined sharply in February as ongoing shortages of semiconductors and other supply chain problems con- tinued to restrain output. Outside of the motor vehicle sector, manufacturing production appeared to have moved up over January and February; however, this in- crease did not appear to reflect a substantial reduction in supply bottlenecks, as many indicators of the state of Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ bottlenecks showed little sign of improvement over this period. In particular, materials inputs such as electronic components and aluminum remained in short supply, while broad measures of industrial input prices remained elevated. Separately, transportation and distribution ac- tivity continued to be held back by port congestion and a shortage of truck drivers. Available indicators suggested that real government pur- chases were little changed in the first quarter after de- clining in the fourth quarter of 2021. Although real state and local purchases appeared to be rising, federal de- fense purchases appeared to be contracting further in the first quarter. The U.S. international trade deficit widened at the end of last year to a record high and surpassed that high at the beginning of this year. Imports of goods grew rap- idly again in January, led by increases in consumer goods, while exports of goods fell back slightly from elevated fourth-quarter levels. Shipping congestion and other bottlenecks continued to restrain the level of trade in goods. Services exports and imports fell back in January relative to December, reflecting a reduction in travel to and from the United States. Because international travel remained depressed, services trade was still very low rel- ative to pre-pandemic norms. Incoming data suggested that the rapid spread of the Omicron variant had tempered the foreign recovery around the turn of the year. Purchasing managers in- dexes were consistent with the Omicron wave having a notable effect on services activity but a rather muted ef- fect on manufacturing activity and supplier delivery times. Moreover, with COVID-19 cases having fallen in many regions, authorities had already eased restrictions and social mobility had recovered, except in China, where lockdowns were recently reimposed. The Russian invasion of Ukraine, however, constituted another neg- ative shock to the global economy by pushing up com- modity prices further, hurting global risk sentiment, and exacerbating supply bottlenecks. Inflation abroad con- tinued to rise, driven by recovering global demand, rising retail energy and food prices, and ongoing strains on global supply chains; the effects of the Russian invasion contributed to some of these inflationary pressures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial markets were highly volatile over the inter- meeting period, with strained liquidity in some markets. The Russian invasion of Ukraine led to periods of par- ticularly elevated volatility and deteriorating investor risk sentiment. Nominal Treasury yields and the expected path of policy rose during the intermeeting period, driven by economic data releases and FOMC communi- cations that were viewed as implying a more rapid re- moval of monetary policy accommodation than previ- ously expected. Domestic equity indexes declined mod- estly, while those in Europe fell noticeably. Financing conditions remained accommodative, although borrow- ing costs increased further. Investors interpreted incoming economic data and Fed- eral Reserve communications as implying a more rapid removal of monetary policy accommodation than they had previously expected. On net, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by financial market quotes—unadjusted for term premiums—rose signifi- cantly, along with the yields on nominal Treasury secu- rities, since the previous FOMC meeting. Near-term in- flation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities rose sharply, reflecting the higher- than-anticipated CPI releases and surging energy prices following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Spreads of investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds widened noticeably since the previous FOMC meeting and ended the period close to the medians of their historical distributions. Spreads of municipal bonds also widened significantly across credit categories. Broad equity indexes declined modestly, on net, amid significant fluctuations. Equity prices increased early in the period because of stronger-than-anticipated corpo- rate earnings and economic data releases, but they re- traced these gains as investor risk sentiment deteriorated following the Ukraine invasion. The one-month option- implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—surged briefly immediately following the invasion but ended the intermeeting period slightly lower on net. Foreign asset prices were highly volatile over the inter- meeting period in response to geopolitical develop- ments, central bank communications, and rising infla- tion concerns. News related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in particular, contributed to decreases in major foreign equity indexes, especially in Europe, and a mod- erate increase in the broad dollar index. Despite down- ward pressure from the geopolitical events, AFE sover- eign yields increased notably, on net, on higher-than-ex- pected inflation readings and central bank communica- tions that were perceived as less accommodative than expected. EME sovereign spreads widened, and EME- dedicated funds experienced moderate portfolio out- flows, which increased after the Russian invasion. Even so, financial conditions among EMEs—including fund flows and the relative strength of local currencies outside of Europe—were resilient compared with past episodes Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ of global turbulence, reflecting in part higher commodity prices and monetary policy tightening by EME central banks. Liquidity conditions became strained in some financial markets during the intermeeting period. Market depth—a gauge of the ability to transact in large volumes at quotes posted by market makers—deteriorated in U.S. Treasury, U.S. equity, and crude oil markets. Trading volumes generally remained within normal ranges in most markets and increased above normal levels in Treasury markets later in the period. Bid–ask spreads did not increase notably in most markets. However, in- vestors reported that strained liquidity at times amplified the volatility of price moves and may have contributed to the particularly large swings in Treasury yields and eq- uity prices late in the intermeeting period. Short-term funding markets were mostly stable over the intermeeting period, although spreads in some segments widened. The effective federal funds rate and the Se- cured Overnight Financing Rate generally held steady at 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. Overnight rates on commercial paper (CP) across most sectors also held steady, although rates and spreads on longer-tenor CP and negotiable certificates of deposit increased amid the escalation of the Ukraine invasion. Spreads between three-month forward rate agreements and overnight in- dex swaps widened as borrowers increased precaution- ary issuance of longer-tenor debt while money market investors preferred investments. ON RRP take-up was little changed, averaging about $1.6 trillion. shorter-duration In domestic credit markets, credit remained broadly available for most types of borrowers during the inter- meeting period. Nonfinancial gross corporate bond is- suance slowed noticeably in January and February, re- flecting lower demand for credit due to rising borrowing costs and elevated issuance over the past two years. However, issuance rebounded to healthy levels in March for investment-grade firms, with a few high-yield firms also raising funds. Leveraged loan issuance was strong in January and February. Small business loan origina- tions in December roughly matched pre-pandemic lev- els. The share of small firms that actively sought financ- ing in the past few months and reported that it was more difficult to acquire credit compared with three months earlier remained very low. For households, both nonmortgage and mortgage credit remained accommodative. Credit card balances in- creased significantly in the fourth quarter, and auto credit outstanding grew at a moderate pace in Decem- ber. The number of mortgage rate locks for home pur- chases through February was elevated relative to pre- pandemic levels. Mortgage credit for households with low credit scores continued to ease through February but remained tighter than before the pandemic. The credit quality of large nonfinancial corporations and municipalities remained strong over the intermeeting pe- riod. The volumes of credit rating upgrades for corpo- rate and municipal bonds outpaced those of downgrades moderately in January and February. Default rates on corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and leveraged loans remained very low; most market indicators of future ex- pected default rates for corporate bonds and leveraged loans also remained low. Credit quality in the commercial real estate sector con- tinued to show some signs of stress. Delinquency rates for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) col- lateralized by hotel and retail properties continued to de- cline in January but remained well above pre-pandemic levels, while those for CMBS in the office sector in- creased somewhat in January but remained fairly low by historical standards. For households, credit quality remained fairly healthy. Delinquency rates for mortgages, which include loans in forbearance and other loans behind on payments, con- tinued to trend down through December, while those for prime auto loan and prime credit card borrowers re- mained flat in December. For nonprime borrowers, de- linquency rates rose in December, although they re- mained subdued by historical standards. Information on borrowing costs through February and early March suggested that the events surrounding Rus- sia’s invasion of Ukraine did not have a significant effect on financing conditions during the intermeeting period. Borrowing costs continued to increase in many sectors but remained low relative to their historical distributions. Spreads in the corporate bond, municipal bond, and CMBS markets generally rose to somewhat above their pre-pandemic levels, reflecting heightened geopolitical risks, uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy, and elevated financial market volatility. Residential mortgage rates increased, mostly as a result of widening MBS spreads, which market participants attributed mainly to the tapering of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS purchases and uncertainty surrounding the market supply of agency MBS that would accompany balance sheet runoff by the Federal Reserve. Interest rates on Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ new credit cards rose to roughly their pre-pandemic lev- els, while rates on auto loans also rose slightly but re- mained significantly below pre-pandemic levels. Staff Economic Outlook The near-term projection for U.S. economic activity pre- pared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was weaker than in January, reflecting the anticipated eco- nomic effects of the conflict in Ukraine and financial conditions that were expected to be less supportive than previously assumed. For 2022 as a whole, real GDP growth was projected to step down markedly from its rapid 2021 pace before picking up slightly in 2023 as the continued resolution of supply constraints provided a small boost to growth. Real GDP growth was expected to slow further in 2024 to a pace that was in line with potential growth. However, the level of real GDP was expected to remain well above potential over the projec- tion period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight. The staff’s near-term projection for PCE price inflation was revised up considerably relative to January. The up- ward revision reflected the staff’s reaction to the persis- tently high and broad-based levels of domestic inflation, import price inflation, and wage growth that had been observed, as well as the staff’s expectation that the up- ward pressure on inflation from supply and demand im- balances would last longer than previously assumed. In addition, total PCE price inflation was further revised up to reflect higher expected paths for consumer energy and food prices. All told, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 4 percent in 2022. PCE price inflation was then expected to slow to 2.3 percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as food, energy, and import price in- flation moved lower and as supply and demand imbal- ances were resolved. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The COVID-19 pandemic remained a source of downside risk to activity, while the possibility of more severe and more persistent supply issues was viewed as posing an additional downside risk to activity and an upside risk to inflation. The Russian invasion of Ukraine was perceived as adding to the uncertainty around the outlook for economic activity and inflation, as the conflict carried the risk of further exacerbating supply chain disruptions and of putting additional up- ward pressure on inflation by boosting the prices for en- ergy, food, and other key commodities. Finally, the pos- sibility that continued high inflation would cause longer- term inflation expectations to become unanchored was seen as another upside risk to the inflation projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Inflation remained ele- vated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbal- ances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary pol- icy, participants expected inflation to return to the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective over time and the labor mar- ket to remain strong. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. They judged that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain, but in the near term, the invasion and related events were likely to create signifi- cant additional upward pressure on inflation and could weigh on economic activity. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that real GDP growth had slowed from its rapid pace in the fourth quarter of 2021, largely reflecting weaker in- ventory investment, but consumption and business in- vestment continued to rise solidly. The Omicron variant left only a mild and brief imprint on economic data, as households and firms appeared resilient to this wave of the virus. Relative to their December forecasts, partici- pants had revised down their projections for real GDP growth this year, reflecting factors such as a slowdown in inventory investment from its strong pace late last year, reduced fiscal and monetary policy accommoda- tion, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had led to higher prices of energy and other commodities, in- creased uncertainty, and weighed on broader financial Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions and consumer sentiment. Even so, partici- pants judged that economic fundamentals remained solid and that they expected above-trend growth to con- tinue, sustaining a strong labor market. Participants commented that demand for labor contin- ued to substantially exceed available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. Participants observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. Employment growth remained strong through the Omicron wave. A couple of participants highlighted that the annual bench- mark revision to the establishment survey employment data revealed stronger employment growth in the second half of 2021 than was initially reported. The unemploy- ment rate had fallen to a post-pandemic low, and quits and job openings were at all-time highs. Although pay- roll employment remained below its pre-pandemic level, the shortfall was concentrated in a few sectors and re- flected a shortage of workers rather than insufficient de- mand for labor. Consistent with a tight labor market, nominal wages were rising at the fastest pace in many years. While wage gains thus far had been the strongest among the lowest quartile of earners and among produc- tion and supervisory workers, wage pressures had begun to spread across the income and skill distributions. Many participants commented that they expected the la- bor market to remain strong and wage pressures to re- main elevated. A few participants noted that there were signs that the pandemic-related factors that had held back labor supply might be abating and pointed to the notable increase in the labor force participation rate among prime-age men in February. Participants remarked that recent inflation readings con- tinued to significantly exceed the Committee’s longer- run goal and noted that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including the related surge in energy prices, will add to near-term inflation pres- sures. Some participants noted that elevated inflation had continued to broaden from goods into services, es- pecially rents, and into sectors that had not yet experi- enced large price increases, such as education, apparel, and health care. A few participants also noted that the number of spending categories experiencing inflation rates above 4 percent had continued to rise, or that the trimmed mean inflation measure from the Federal Re- serve Bank of Dallas had risen to its highest level since the early 1980s. Many participants indicated that their business contacts continued to report substantial in- creases in wages and input prices that were being passed through into higher prices to their customers without any significant decrease in demand. Participants com- mented on a few factors that might lead the high infla- tion readings to persist, including strong aggregate de- mand, significant increases in energy and commodity prices, and supply chain disruptions that were likely to require a lengthy period to resolve. In addition, some participants noted that recent higher inflation could af- fect future inflation dynamics. For example, a few par- ticipants commented that persistently high inflation readings might lead businesses, when setting prices, to be more attentive to aggregate inflation or more willing to raise prices. In addition, a couple of other participants noted that some household survey data suggested that near-term consumer inflation expectations have become more sensitive to actual inflation readings since the be- ginning of the pandemic. A few participants commented that both survey- and market-based measures of short- term inflation expectations were at historically high lev- els. Several other participants noted that longer-term measures of inflation expectations from households, professional forecasters, and market participants still ap- peared to remain well anchored, which—together with appropriate monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply constraints—would support a return of inflation over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal. Participants agreed that developments surrounding the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including the resulting sanctions, were adding to inflation pressures and posing upside risks to the inflation outlook. Participants noted that Russia and Ukraine were major suppliers of various commodities used in the production of energy, food, and some industrial inputs. A continued cutoff of that supply from the world market would further push up prices for those commodities and, over time, lead to price increases in downstream industries. The invasion had also exacerbated the disruptions of supply chains. Participants commented that, by leading to higher en- ergy and food prices, weighing on consumer sentiment, and contributing to tighter financial conditions, the in- vasion also negatively affected the growth outlook. A few participants highlighted additional downside risks to growth associated with the war, such as the risk that a more protracted conflict than the public currently ex- pects could lead to much tighter global financial condi- tions or other disruptions. A couple of participants commented that the increased uncertainty might lead businesses and consumers to reduce spending, though their business contacts currently were not seeing signs of such shifts or expecting a significant pullback in demand. Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Several participants judged that the upside risk to infla- tion associated with the war appeared more significant than the downside risk to growth, as inflation was al- ready high, the United States had a relatively low level of financial and trade exposure to Russia, and the U.S. economy was well positioned to absorb additional ad- verse demand shocks. In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants agreed that uncertainty regarding the path of inflation was elevated and that risks to inflation were weighted to the upside. Participants cited several such risks, includ- ing ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices, both of which were exacerbated by the Russian invasion; recent COVID-related lockdowns in China that had the potential to further disrupt supply chains; and the possibility that longer-run inflation ex- pectations might become unanchored. Uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated. Various participants noted downside risks to the outlook, includ- ing risks associated with the Russian invasion, a broad tightening in global financial conditions, and a pro- longed rise in energy prices. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, all participants concurred that the U.S. economy was very strong, with an extremely tight labor market, and that inflation was high and well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to begin a process of removing policy accommodation by raising the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. They further judged that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the Committee’s objectives. Par- ticipants also agreed that reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet would play an important role in firming the stance of monetary policy and that they ex- pected it would be appropriate to begin this process at a coming meeting, possibly as soon as in May. Partici- pants judged that the firming of monetary policy, along- side an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal while sustaining a strong labor market. Many participants noted that—with inflation well above the Committee’s objective, inflationary risks to the up- side, and the federal funds rate well below participants’ estimates of its longer-run level—they would have pre- ferred a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting. A number of these participants indicated, however, that, in light of greater near-term uncertainty associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, they judged that a 25 basis point increase would be appropriate at this meeting. Many participants noted that one or more 50 basis point increases in the target range could be appropriate at future meetings, particularly if inflation pressures remained elevated or intensified. A number of participants noted that the Committee’s previous communications had already con- tributed to a tightening of financial conditions, as evi- dent in the notable increase in longer-term interest rates over recent months. All participants indicated their strong commitment and determination to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. In that context, participants judged that the Committee’s approach of commencing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate, and indicating that ongoing increases were likely, was fully warranted. Participants judged that it would be appropriate to move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture expeditiously. They also noted that, depending on eco- nomic and financial developments, a move to a tighter policy stance could be warranted. A few participants judged that, at the current juncture, a significant risk fac- ing the Committee was that elevated inflation and infla- tion expectations could become entrenched if the public began to question the Committee’s resolve to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate to achieve the Commit- tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation. These participants suggested that expediting the removal of policy accommodation would reduce this risk while also leaving the Committee well positioned to adjust the stance of policy if geopolitical and other developments led to a more rapid dissipation of demand pressures than expected. Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions must take ac- count of the state of financial markets and the economy. As always, the Committee would need to be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook. In this regard, participants noted that developments as- sociated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine posed height- ened risks for both the United States and the global economy. Against this backdrop, all participants judged that risk management would be important in deciding upon the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and that policy also would need to be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook. In particular, all participants underscored the need to remain attentive Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ to the risks of further upward pressure on inflation and longer-run inflation expectations. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that indicators of economic activity and employment had continued to strengthen. Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting continued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members agreed that geopolitical developments war- ranted several changes to the postmeeting statement. They concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship, and they agreed to update the statement to recognize this tragic situation. Members agreed that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain, but they judged that, in the near term, the invasion and related events were likely to create additional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. for achieving In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability goals, members agreed that with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, they expected inflation to return to the Commit- tee’s 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to ½ to ¾ percent at this meeting in light of elevated inflation pressures. With re- gard to reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet, all members agreed that they had made sub- stantial progress on arriving at a plan specifying the steps the Committee would take. They expected that, depend- ing on economic and financial conditions, beginning the process of reducing the size of the balance sheet would be appropriate at a coming meeting, possibly as early as at the Committee’s May meeting. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 17, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to ½ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 0.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per- counterparty limit can be temporarily in- creased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Indicators of economic activity and employ- ment have continued to strengthen. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the un- employment rate has declined substantially. In- flation remains elevated, reflecting supply and Minutes of the Meeting of March 15–16, 2022Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pres- sures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain, but in the near term the inva- sion and related events are likely to create addi- tional upward pressure on inflation and weigh on economic activity. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent ob- jective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¼ to ½ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee ex- pects to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities at a coming meeting. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” George, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: James Bullard. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting. President Bullard preferred at this meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.5 percentage point to ½ to ¾ percent in light of elevated inflation pressures. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 0.40 percent, effective March 17, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unani- mously to approve a ¼ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 0.50 percent, effective March 17, 2022.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, May 3–4, 2022.6 The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. on March 16, 2022. Notation Votes By notation vote completed on February 15, 2022, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 25–26, 2022. By notation vote completed on February 17, 2022, the Committee unanimously approved the Investment Trading Policy for FOMC Officials and related revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC information. In conjunction with the notation vote, all non-voting par- ticipants also expressed support for the Policy and re- lated revisions to the Program. Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C.

Raskin,2 Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of New York, San Francisco, and New York, respectively Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a discussion of monetary policy expectations in the United States. Federal Re- serve communications since the March FOMC meeting were perceived as signaling a more rapid removal of pol- icy accommodation than had been expected, resulting in significant shifts in expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate. For the current meeting, federal funds futures implied around 50 basis points of policy rate tightening, and Open Market Desk survey respond- ents assigned an average probability of 80 percent to that outcome. The median Desk survey respondents also projected 50-basis-point increases in the target range at the two following meetings and another 125 basis points of increases by the middle of next year, bringing the pro- jected midpoint of the target range to a peak of 3.13 per- cent—substantially higher than in previous surveys. Market participants continued to note significant uncer- tainty regarding the economic outlook and the degree of policy tightening ahead. This uncertainty was reflected in the dispersion in survey respondents’ average proba- bility distribution for the target range at the end of 2023. Regarding the outlook for runoff of the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings, market participants widely expected the Committee to announce the commence- ment of balance sheet runoff at the current meeting. Median survey responses suggested that most market participants anticipated maximum redemption caps of $60 billion per month for Treasury securities and $35 billion per month for agency mortgage-backed secu- rities (MBS), with the caps phased in over roughly three months. Survey responses continued to reflect substan- tial dispersion in views on the level of System Open Mar- ket Account (SOMA) holdings at which balance sheet runoff would end. The manager turned next to a discussion of U.S. finan- cial market developments. Financial conditions tight- ened notably over the period. Treasury yields increased across the curve, with the rise primarily reflecting higher real interest rates. Longer-term private borrowing rates also moved higher, with 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rates rising above 5 percent to the highest levels in over a decade. Equity indexes ended the period substantially lower, on net. These indexes moved up earlier in the period in connection with a perceived reduction in tail risks stemming from the war in Ukraine but then moved lower, reportedly because of increased caution regarding 3 Attended Tuesday’s session only. 4 Attended the discussion of economic developments and out- look.

The dollar appreciated, leaving the broad trade-weighted dollar up around 2 percent over the period. Viewed over a longer time horizon, fi- nancial conditions, as measured by many financial con- ditions indexes, had tightened by historically large amounts since the beginning of the year. Market- and survey-based measures of U.S. inflation ex- pectations continued to project a significant deceleration in inflation in the coming years. Nonetheless, far-for- ward inflation compensation rose over the period, and market participants remained attentive to the risk that, in bringing inflation back to 2 percent, the Committee would need to tighten by more than currently expected. In global financial developments, many advanced-econ- omy central banks raised policy rates over the period, and investors increasingly came to anticipate tighter monetary policy ahead in most advanced foreign econo- mies. The Bank of Japan was an exception and was widely anticipated to maintain its accommodative poli- cies. The yen depreciated 9 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period to its weakest level in over two decades. Emerging market (EM) currencies re- mained relatively resilient. Market participants focused on the spread of COVID-19 in China and the effect of zero-COVID policies, which had resulted in increasingly widespread lockdowns. The renminbi depreciated against the dollar around 4 percent over the intermeeting period. The manager turned next to a discussion of develop- ments in money markets. The effective federal funds rate rose 25 basis points following the increase in the target range at the March FOMC meeting and remained stable throughout the period. Secured overnight rates also rose by 25 basis points following the March meet- ing, though modest softness emerged in subsequent days. Market participants noted that ongoing uncer- tainty about the near-term path of Federal Reserve pol- icy had increased demand for very short-dated invest- ments. This demand, combined with declining Treasury bill supply, contributed to the downward pressure on se- cured rates and to rising overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) usage. The manager expected that ON RRP usage could remain elevated in coming months but anticipated that, over the longer term, usage would decline as balance sheet reduction proceeded. The manager indicated that the Desk was prepared to implement the Committee’s plan for balance sheet re- duction and that, in the event that the Committee an- nounced the plan at the end of the current meeting, the Desk would issue a statement and FAQs providing the public with details regarding the implementation of the plan. The Desk would closely monitor market condi- tions and update the Committee during the runoff pro- cess. The deputy SOMA manager reviewed developments concerning Desk operations. The Desk planned to in- crease the publication frequency of data on ON RRP us- age. This additional information would provide the pub- lic with greater transparency about usage of the ON RRP facility. The Desk planned to publish the SOMA annual report soon. In addition to the detailed review of open market operations over 2021, the report would include updated illustrative projections of the size and composi- tion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over coming years. With respect to other operational matters, the Desk continued to work on details of plans for agency MBS CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Security Identifi- cation Procedures) aggregation and anticipated that this process would begin in coming months. Finally, the deputy manager requested that the Committee vote to maintain the standing U.S. dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements and to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with Canada and Mexico under the North American Framework Agreement. In their discussion, participants widely agreed that the standing swap lines are a critical tool allowing the Federal Reserve to address global dollar funding pressures that could otherwise adversely affect the U.S. economy. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the May 3–4 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022Page 3 (GDP) declined in the first quarter. However, first-quar- ter growth in private domestic final demand was faster than in the previous quarter, while labor market condi- tions tightened further in March. Consumer price infla- tion through March—as measured by the 12-month per- centage change in the price index for personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in March, and the unemployment rate declined to 3.6 percent. The un- employment rates for African Americans and for His- panics moved lower, though both rates remained notice- ably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate increased in March, as did the employ- ment-to-population ratio. The private-sector job open- ings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, remained elevated. The employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector rose 4.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March; this gain was much larger than the corresponding 12-month changes posted in each of the preceding four years and was the largest 12-month increase since 1990. Consumer prices continued to rise rapidly. Total PCE price inflation was 6.6 percent over the 12 months end- ing in March, and core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.2 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.7 percent in March, 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. A new ver- sion of the staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, moved up in the first quarter and was at the upper end of the range of values seen since 2005. Both real PCE and residential investment increased in the first quarter at rates similar to those seen in the fourth quarter of 2021. Business fixed investment growth picked up sharply in the first quarter, with spend- ing on equipment and intellectual property products posting a large increase. Inventory investment moved lower after surging in the fourth quarter of 2021, and total real government purchases declined further, led by a drop in defense purchases. The U.S. international trade deficit widened further in the first quarter of this year, and net exports made a large negative contribution to real U.S. GDP growth. Goods imports continued the fourth quarter’s strong growth, driven by large increases in real imports of consumer goods, capital goods, and automotive products. By con- trast, real exports of goods fell back after rising briskly late last year, with broad-based declines in most major categories. Both real exports and imports of services grew at a moderate pace in the first quarter, though both were held back by a tepid recovery in international travel amid ongoing waves of COVID-19. Data suggested that foreign economic growth remained solid in the first quarter, as most economies continued to show adaptability to new COVID-19 waves. Chinese data for March and April, however, showed declines in manufacturing and services activity and worsening sup- ply bottlenecks after Chinese authorities locked down Shanghai and other cities to combat the spread of the Omicron variant. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine also left its imprint on foreign economies, with consumer and business sentiment declining in Europe and global prices of a range of commodities continuing to rise. Foreign inflation increased significantly further, driven by surging energy and food prices as well as some broadening of price pressures to core goods and ser- vices. In response, many central banks around the world tightened their monetary policy stances. Staff Review of the Financial Situation U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher over the in- termeeting period as Federal Reserve communications and domestic economic data releases were perceived as suggesting that a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy was likely over coming months. Sovereign yields in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also increased notably. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined on net, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—remained elevated. Short-term funding markets were stable, while participa- tion in the ON RRP facility increased further. Amid the increase in Treasury yields, borrowing costs increased in many sectors and were at or somewhat above pre-pan- demic levels. Since the March FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year Treasury yields increased significantly on net. The in- creases in nominal Treasury yields were primarily ac- counted for by rising real yields, while inflation compen- sation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities was little changed. Alongside moves in shorter-term Treasury yields, the expected federal funds rate path— implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—rose notably since the March FOMC meeting. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Broad equity indexes decreased over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, equity prices increased, sup- ported by the robust pace of economic activity and re- duced market concerns about the implications for the global economy of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The initial sharp gains in stock prices were followed by larger declines later in the period, as longer-term interest rates rose substantially and as some disappointing earnings re- ports toward the end of the intermeeting period weighed on equity prices. The VIX declined substantially early in the period but ended the period little changed on net, remaining at elevated levels. Similarly, spreads on invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately earlier in the intermeeting period and then widened, ending the period only slightly narrower, on net, and below the median of their historical distribution. Spreads on municipal bonds were up modestly and stood at about the 90th percentile of their historical dis- tribution. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the March in- crease in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates pass- ing through to overnight money market rates. Secured overnight rates softened later in the period, with down- ward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, increased activity in certain segments of the repo market that tend to trade at lower rates, and money market funds continuing to shorten portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated. Spreads on most types of longer-tenor commercial pa- per and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed, re- portedly reflecting reduced market concerns about the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, although some of the spreads remained slightly wider than those seen earlier this year. Over the intermeeting period, sovereign yields in AFEs increased notably because of concerns about further in- flationary pressures, some central bank communications that were perceived as less accommodative than ex- pected, and spillovers from rises in U.S. Treasury yields. Prospects of tighter monetary policy and COVID-re- lated lockdowns in China weighed on prices of risky as- sets, but investor concerns surrounding the economic effects of the war in Ukraine seemed to abate partially. On balance, major foreign equity indexes registered mixed and relatively modest changes. The U.S. dollar generally strengthened, with a more pronounced dollar appreciation against AFE currencies, as U.S. Treasury yields generally rose more than their AFE counterparts. Among EM currencies, the dollar appreciated signifi- cantly against the Chinese renminbi. Over the intermeeting period, along with the increase in Treasury yields, borrowing costs increased in many sec- tors and were at or somewhat above pre-pandemic lev- els. Credit remained widely available, and borrower credit quality continued to be strong overall. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased substantially, with the 30-year mortgage offer rates reaching levels not seen since 2010. This increase largely reflected the rise in the 10-year Treasury yield. Corpo- rate bond yields also increased, although the effect of the increase in Treasury yields was partly offset by narrower spreads. Municipal bond yields also increased notably. Bank loan rates for commercial borrowers increased and rates on large syndicated loans were roughly in line with pre-pandemic levels. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward. Credit, which remained widely available for most types of borrowers, was broadly in line with pre-pandemic lev- els. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance re- bounded sharply in March, mostly reflecting an increase in investment-grade issuance, while gross institutional leveraged loan issuance slowed amid elevated geopoliti- cal uncertainty. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on bank balance sheets also grew robustly in March. Respondents in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac- tices (SLOOS) reported a continued easing of lending terms and strengthening demand for C&I loans as well as easing standards for multifamily CRE loans. For most small businesses, credit appeared to be availa- ble, although these businesses’ demand for credit report- edly remained weak. In the April SLOOS, large banks reported unchanged standards on C&I loans to small firms, while small banks tightened standards modestly to such firms. In consumer credit markets, credit card balances grew strongly in the first quarter amid easing standards and greater utilization, and auto credit outstanding continued to grow steadily through February despite vehicle pro- duction shortfalls and low vehicle inventories. Residen- tial mortgage credit conditions remained accommoda- _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022Page 5 tive through March, despite the increase in mortgage in- terest rates, particularly for stronger borrowers who met standard loan criteria. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and house- holds remained strong overall. The volume of credit rat- ing upgrades for corporate bonds outpaced downgrades moderately in March, continuing a nearly yearlong pat- tern. The credit quality of C&I loans on banks’ books continued to be strong as delinquency and default rates both remained low. Delinquency rates on bank and nonbank loans to small businesses edged down in Feb- ruary, while in the CRE sector, borrower financial health continued to recover. Household credit quality re- mained strong, and delinquency rates across both prime and nonprime borrowers continued to be subdued by historical standards. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff judged that, amid a substantial upward shift in interest rates, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and ongoing disruptions to supply chains, the financial system—outside of commodities markets—had been resilient. However, larger or pro- longed disruptions in commodities markets could inter- fere with other markets and real activity more broadly. To date, however, such potential spillovers appeared to be limited. The staff noted that increased uncertainty and ongoing volatility had reduced risk appetite in financial markets and eased price pressures, although valuations of many assets remained elevated. CRE valuations appeared somewhat elevated except for sectors that were affected most by the pandemic. Residential house prices had risen rapidly, although the staff continued to see key dif- ferences from the previous debt-fueled housing boom: The mortgage finance reforms enacted after 2008 lim- ited the potential for significant deterioration in under- writing standards, most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores, and home- owners’ equity positions were healthy. The staff assessed that aggregate household and business leverage was moderate. Households’ debt-to-GDP ratio remained relatively low, and there were few signs of in- creased stress among lower-income households. Busi- ness debt remained elevated relative to its pre-pandemic history, but interest coverage ratios were high. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities arising from finan- cial leverage remained moderate on balance. Despite market volatility, the banking sector continued to be well capitalized with strong liquidity. The staff noted that leverage at key nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) was elevated and that bank lending to NBFIs continued to increase notably. Relatedly, NBFIs’ reliance on bank credit lines to meet unexpected liquidity needs could generate moderate liquidity pressures at large banks dur- ing times of financial stress. With regard to funding risk, the staff highlighted structural vulnerabilities in some types of mutual funds as a continuing focus. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was broadly similar to the March pro- jection. The staff noted that the first-quarter decline in real GDP was driven by categories of spending that had often been volatile in the past, and they viewed the con- tinued strength in private domestic final demand, the la- bor market, and industrial production as providing a more accurate picture of the economy’s direction in the first quarter. The staff therefore anticipated that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and ad- vance at a solid pace over the remainder of the year. GDP growth was then expected to slow in 2023 and 2024 as monetary policy became less accommodative and financial conditions tightened further; by 2024, real GDP growth was expected to be in line with potential output growth. However, the level of real GDP was ex- pected to remain well above potential over the projec- tion period, and labor market conditions were expected to remain very tight. The staff’s projection for PCE price inflation was re- vised up slightly in the second half of 2022 and in 2023 in response to the slow resolution of supply constraints seen over the first part of 2022, a higher projected path for import prices, and a judgment that wage increases would put more upward pressure on services prices than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.3 percent in 2022. PCE price in- flation was then expected to step down to 2.5 percent in 2023 and to 2.1 percent in 2024 as supply–demand im- balances in the economy were reduced by slowing aggre- gate demand and an anticipated easing of supply con- straints. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The war in Ukraine was seen as a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse develop- ments associated with rising COVID infections in China were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had declined substantially. Inflation re- mained elevated, reflecting continued supply and de- mand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the inva- sion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous hu- man and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the implications for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain. The invasion and re- lated events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition, participants judged that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks. Participants commented that after its rapid growth in the last quarter of 2021, real GDP had declined in the first quarter of this year, with net exports and inventory in- vestment making large negative contributions to growth. They noted, however, that these volatile components tended to contain little signal about subsequent growth and that household spending and business fixed invest- ment had remained strong in the first quarter. These advances and the further tightening of labor market con- ditions were judged consistent with significant underly- ing momentum in the domestic economy. In line with this judgment, participants expected that real GDP would grow solidly in the current quarter. In their dis- cussion of the economic outlook beyond the near term, participants indicated that they expected that output would expand more moderately this year than in 2021, with growth this year likely near or above its longer-run rate, and that the imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply would diminish over time. Partic- ipants saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy as playing a central role in addressing this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. An easing of supply bottle- necks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply–demand imbalances in the economy and lower inflation over the medium term. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants recognized the need to adjust the stance of policy depending on how these and other factors played out over time. In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that they expected robust growth in consump- tion spending. They pointed to several elements sup- porting this outlook, including strong household balance sheets, wide availability of jobs, and the U.S. economy’s resilience in the face of new waves of the virus. The considerable increases in Treasury yields across maturi- ties over the intermeeting period were associated with rising interest rates faced by households, particularly rates on home mortgages. A couple of participants re- ported that their business contacts continued to see ro- bust housing demand and elevated home prices despite higher mortgage interest rates. With respect to the business sector, participants cited ro- bust consumer demand, healthy household balance sheets, and inventory rebuilding as factors supportive of business activity and investment. The ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Although some partici- pants noted that their business contacts had reported an easing of supply constraints, participants assessed that supply constraints overall were still significant and would likely take some time to be resolved. In addition, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and COVID-related lockdowns in China were seen as likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. A few participants indicated that some of their business contacts were reportedly hes- itant to expand capacity or had postponed construction projects. Participants commented that demand for labor contin- ued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. Employment growth had continued at a strong pace, the unemployment rate had fallen to a near- 50-year low, quits and job openings had remained ex- tremely elevated, and nominal wages had continued to rise rapidly. A few participants noted that there were signs that the pandemic-related factors that had held back labor supply might be abating further, especially in the case of prime-age workers. In addition, a few other participants suggested that the unwelcome erosion of real incomes due to high inflation may have contributed to the increase in labor supply. Many participants indi- cated that they expected the labor market to remain tight _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022Page 7 and wage pressures to stay elevated for some time. Sev- eral participants raised the possibility that, in light of the exceptionally high ratio of vacancies to job searchers, a moderation in labor demand might serve to reduce va- cancies and wage pressures without having significant ef- fects on the unemployment rate. Participants observed that inflation continued to run well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and that in- flation pressures were evident in a broad array of goods and services. Various participants remarked on the hardship caused by elevated inflation and heightened in- flation uncertainty—including by eroding American families’ real incomes and wealth and by making it more difficult for businesses to make production and invest- ment plans. They also pointed out that high inflation could impede the achievement of maximum employ- ment on a sustained basis. Participants noted that devel- opments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including surges in energy and commodity prices, were adding to near-term inflation pressures. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to dis- rupt global supply chains, potentially adding further up- ward pressure on the prices paid by U.S. businesses and consumers. Most participants indicated that their busi- ness contacts had continued to report that substantial in- creases in wages and input prices were being passed through into higher prices to their customers. A few participants added that some of their contacts were start- ing to report that higher prices were hurting sales. A number of participants observed that recent monthly data might suggest that overall price pressures may no longer be worsening. These participants also empha- sized that price pressures remained elevated and that it was too early to be confident that inflation had peaked. Many participants commented that measures of short- term inflation expectations were elevated or that far-for- ward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range. Several participants judged that measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants still appeared to be broadly consistent with the Committee’s longer-run in- flation objective, likely reflecting respondents’ confi- dence that the Federal Reserve would take the actions necessary to return inflation to 2 percent. They noted that, together with appropriate firming of monetary pol- icy and an eventual easing of supply constraints, well- anchored longer-term inflation expectations would sup- port a return of inflation to levels consistent with the Committee’s longer-run goal. In their discussion of risks to the outlook, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and would continue to monitor closely inflation de- velopments and inflation expectations. They agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongo- ing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices—both of which were exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Also mentioned were the risks associated with nominal wage growth continuing to run above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time and the ex- tent to which households’ high savings since the onset of the pandemic and healthy balance sheets would sup- port greater-than-expected underlying momentum in consumer spending and contribute to upside inflation pressures. In addition, some participants emphasized that persistently high inflation heightened the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unan- chored; in that case, the task of returning inflation to 2 percent would be more difficult. Uncertainty about real activity was also seen as elevated. Various partici- pants noted downside risks to the outlook, including risks associated with the Russian invasion and COVID- related lockdowns in China and the likelihood of a pro- longed rise in energy and commodity prices. Several participants who commented on issues related to financial stability noted that the tightening of monetary policy could interact with vulnerabilities related to the liquidity of markets for Treasury securities and to the private sector’s intermediation capacity. A couple of participants pointed to increased risks in financial mar- kets linked to commodities following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which had led to higher prices and volatility across a wide range of energy, agricultural, and metal products. These participants observed that the trading and risk-management practices of some key participants in commodities markets were not fully visible to regula- tory authorities and noted that central counterparties (CCPs) needed to remain capable of managing risks as- sociated with heightened volatility or that margin re- quirements at CCPs could give rise to significant liquid- ity demands for large banks, broker-dealers, and their cli- ents. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, all participants concurred that the U.S. economy was very strong, the labor market was ex- tremely tight, and inflation was very high and well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appro- priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 50 basis points at this meeting. They further anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be warranted to achieve the Commit- tee’s objectives. Participants also agreed that it was ap- propriate to start reducing the size of the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that would be issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement. Participants judged that an ap- propriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. All participants reaffirmed their strong commitment and determination to take the measures necessary to restore price stability. To this end, participants agreed that the Committee should expeditiously move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture, through both increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and reductions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet. Most participants judged that 50 basis point increases in the target range would likely be appropriate at the next couple of meetings. Many participants as- sessed that the Committee’s previous communications had been helpful in shifting market expectations regard- ing the policy outlook into better alignment with the Committee’s assessment and had contributed to the tightening of financial conditions. All participants supported the plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet. This reduction, starting on June 1, would work in parallel with increases in the target range for the policy rate in firming the stance of monetary pol- icy. A number of participants remarked that, after bal- ance sheet runoff was well under way, it would be ap- propriate for the Committee to consider sales of agency MBS to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury secu- rities. Any program of sales of agency MBS would be announced well in advance. Regarding risks related to the balance sheet reduction, several participants noted the potential for unanticipated effects on financial mar- ket conditions. Participants agreed that the economic outlook was highly uncertain and that policy decisions should be data dependent and focused on returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent goal while sustaining strong labor market conditions. At present, participants judged that it was important to move expeditiously to a more neutral monetary policy stance. They also noted that a restric- tive stance of policy may well become appropriate de- pending on the evolving economic outlook and the risks to the outlook. Participants observed that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China posed heightened risks for both the United States and economies around the world. Several participants commented on the chal- lenges that monetary policy faced in restoring price sta- bility while also maintaining strong labor market condi- tions. In light of the high degree of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic outlook, participants judged that risk-management considerations would be important in deliberations over time regarding the appropriate policy stance. Many participants judged that expediting the re- moval of policy accommodation would leave the Com- mittee well positioned later this year to assess the effects of policy firming and the extent to which economic de- velopments warranted policy adjustments. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that, although overall economic activity had edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment had remained strong. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had declined substantially. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting con- tinued supply and demand imbalances, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members judged that the implications of the war for the U.S. economy were highly uncertain. Mem- bers agreed that the invasion and related events were cre- ating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of continuing inflation risks, members judged that it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee is highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, members agreed that, with appropriate firming in the stance of monetary pol- icy, they expected inflation to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of May 3–4, 2022Page 9 to ¾ to 1 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in conjunction with the postmeeting statement. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in- formation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. Following the monetary policy discussion, which in- cluded a consideration of plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet, all participants indicated support for the proposed plans for reducing the size of the balance sheet. The Committee voted unanimously to adopt the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet, as shown below. PLANS FOR REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE FED- ERAL RESERVE’S BALANCE SHEET (as adopted effective May 4, 2022) Consistent with the Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in January 2022, all Committee participants agreed to the following plans for significantly reducing the Federal Re- serve’s securities holdings. • The Committee intends to reduce the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings over time in a predictable manner primarily by adjust- ing the amounts reinvested of principal pay- ments received from securities held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA). Beginning on June 1, principal payments from securities held in the SOMA will be reinvested to the extent that they exceed monthly caps. o For Treasury securities, the cap will in- itially be set at $30 billion per month and after three months will increase to $60 billion per month. The decline in holdings of Treasury securities under this monthly cap will include Treasury coupon securities and, to the extent that coupon maturities are less than the monthly cap, Treasury bills. o For agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, the cap will initially be set at $17.5 billion per month and after three months will increase to $35 billion per month. • Over time, the Committee intends to main- tain securities holdings in amounts needed to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively in its ample reserves regime. o To ensure a smooth transition, the Committee intends to slow and then stop the decline in the size of the bal- ance sheet when reserve balances are somewhat above the level it judges to be consistent with ample reserves. o Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will likely continue to decline for a time, reflecting growth in other Federal Reserve liabilities, until the Committee judges that reserve bal- ances are at an ample level. o Thereafter, the Committee will manage securities holdings as needed to main- tain ample reserves over time. • The Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details of its approach to reducing the size of the balance sheet in light of eco- nomic and financial developments. After adopting the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 5, 2022, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¾ to 1 percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 1.0 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.8 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar month of June that exceeds a monthly cap of $30 billion. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the ex- tent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS re- ceived in the calendar month of June that exceeds a monthly cap of $17.5 billion. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Although overall economic activity edged down in the first quarter, household spending and business fixed investment remained strong. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined sub- stantially. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The implications for the U.S. economy are highly uncertain. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lock- downs in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly at- tentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects inflation to return to its 2 percent ob- jective and the labor market to remain strong. In support of these goals, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be ap- propriate. In addition, the Committee decided to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities on June 1, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in con- junction with this statement. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Esther L. George, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller.

Alisdair G. McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial devel- opments. Over the intermeeting period, there were sig- nificant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incom- ing information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted mark- edly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook. Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury secu- rities ended the period significantly higher, primarily re- flecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indi- cate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term infla- tion compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity condi- tions in the market for Treasury securities had been af- fected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall mar- ket functioning had held up. Responding to higher in- Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ terest rates and some concerns about the growth out- look, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period. The manager turned next to a discussion of develop- ments related to foreign central banks. Most major for- eign central banks were proceeding on a path of remov- ing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several—including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tight- ening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset pur- chase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accom- modative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve con- trol target. On balance, market participants were fo- cused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies. Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effec- tive federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the pe- riod. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on se- cured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the in- terest rate path, which had increased demand for short- term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in over- night private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider fur- ther lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the re- duction in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate. The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Fed- eral Reserve operations and related topics. In accord- ance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA an- nual report and reported in the Board’s first-quarter fi- nancial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached ma- turity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some lia- bilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. Nei- ther unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve’s existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would im- pair the implementation of monetary policy or the Fed- eral Reserve’s ability to achieve its dual-mandate objec- tives. On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the June 14–15 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quar- ter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Con- sumer price inflation—as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for little African Americans and for Hispanics were Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was un- changed. The private-sector job openings rate, as meas- ured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nom- inal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in April, and core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12‑month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent. Production and spending indicators were mixed but gen- erally remained strong. Consumer spending and indus- trial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and sin- gle-family housing starts moved down in April, some in- dicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers meas- ure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general mer- chandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the sec- ond quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter. Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and phar- maceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit wid- ened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April. Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, ac- tivity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on eco- nomic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine contin- ued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persis- tent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further in- creases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world fur- ther tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved sub- stantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price in- dexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and for- eign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in do- mestic credit markets remained generally accommoda- tive. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the out- look for credit quality had begun to deteriorate some- what. Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely be- ing interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined. Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the inter- meeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One- month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index— the VIX—increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and signifi- cantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative- grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reach- ing levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substan- tially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and ne- gotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the pe- riod. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Se- cured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meet- ing, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, ele- vated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury se- curities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio ma- turities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP fa- cility increased further. Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeet- ing period amid investors’ concerns about further infla- tionary pressures and major central banks’ policy com- munications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Inter- est rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with in- creased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Con- cerns about the global growth outlook weighed on eq- uity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied eq- uity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommo- dative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral coun- tries widened further. These moves were partially re- traced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro- area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, espe- cially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately. In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally ac- commodative over the intermeeting period. Credit re- mained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, es- pecially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional lev- eraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offer- ing volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust. Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available. Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance vol- umes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home eq- uity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflect- ing a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans out- standing grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, con- sistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May. Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sec- tors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on non- financial corporate bonds remained well above pre- pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institu- tional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting pe- riod, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In con- sumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward. Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the vol- ume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of fu- ture default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook. Credit quality of business loans on banks’ books re- mained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small busi- ness loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong. Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near his- torical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account hold- ers with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase vol- umes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household bor- rowing only slightly. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection. With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff’s as- sessment that the boost to inflation from supply– demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than pre- viously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply–demand imbalances were pro- jected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core in- flation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater up- ward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China’s zero-COVID policy were both perceived as in- creasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and pro- duction constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections (SEP) was released to the public fol- lowing the conclusion of the meeting. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of pol- icy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the un- employment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances re- lated to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the inva- sion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous hu- man and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In ad- dition, participants indicated that COVID-related lock- downs in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment ap- peared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants in- dicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associ- ated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply– demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Partici- pants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improve- ment in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained ro- bust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several par- ticipants noted that household spending patterns ap- peared to be shifting away from goods to services. Sev- eral participants indicated that some of their contacts re- ported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally ex- pected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of partici- pants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer senti- ment had dropped notably in June, according to the pre- liminary reading in the Michigan survey. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain dis- ruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and ag- ricultural producers’ ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expand- ing their production capacity. Similarly, a few partici- pants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and fi- nancing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time. Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ growth. Additionally, most business contacts had con- tinued to report persistent wage pressures as well as dif- ficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for ad- ditional wage increases appeared to be receding. Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation re- mained below its pre-pandemic level because of the un- usually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was un- likely to move up considerably in the near term. A cou- ple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity. While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appro- priate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to dimin- ish over time, participants generally expected the unem- ployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a grad- ual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moder- ation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate. Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, with to- tal PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above ex- pectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persis- tent than they had previously anticipated. They com- mented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate- income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis. Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, to- gether with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and ser- vices. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and put- ting additional upward pressure on inflation. Partici- pants commented on the global nature of inflation pres- sures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submis- sions, largely in response to higher-than-expected infla- tion readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Com- mittee’s longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer- term inflation expectations well anchored. Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expec- tations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that me- dium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation ex- pectations derived from surveys of households, profes- sional forecasters, and market participants were gener- ally judged to be broadly consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many par- ticipants raised the concern that longer-run inflation ex- pectations could be beginning to drift up to levels incon- sistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee’s objective. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both infla- tion and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing sup- ply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals re- cently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy’s underlying mo- mentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the down- side. Downside risks included the possibility that a fur- ther tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than antici- pated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meet- ing. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All par- ticipants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was nec- essary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objec- tives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the eco- nomic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if ele- vated inflation pressures were to persist. Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate ex- pected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic devel- opments warranted policy adjustments. They also re- marked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objec- tive, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce infla- tion pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Partici- pants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected. At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee’s objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk manage- ment perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many partici- pants judged that a significant risk now facing the Com- mittee was that elevated inflation could become en- trenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as war- ranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appro- priate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in re- storing price stability. Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the un- employment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on in- flation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolv- ing outlook. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, mem- bers agreed that the Committee would continue reduc- ing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1¼ to 1½ percent at this meeting. Members judged that, with high and widespread infla- tion pressures and some measures of longer-term infla- tion expectations moving up somewhat, it would be ap- propriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning infla- tion to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market condi- tions, members also agreed to remove the previous state- ment language that had indicated an expectation that ap- propriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in- formation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 1.75 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 1.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of June and July that ex- ceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Re- deem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in the calendar months of June and July that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pres- sures. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The invasion and related events are creating ad- ditional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addi- tion, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the tar- get range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Lisa D. Cook, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: Esther L. George. Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting. President George dissented because she judged that a large increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would add to uncertainty about policy concurrent with the beginning of balance sheet runoff in ways that could unsettle households and businesses and could also adversely affect the ability of small banks to meet the credit needs of their communities. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 1.65 percent, effective June 16, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ¾ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective June 16, 2022.5 5 In taking this action, the Board approved a request to estab- lish that rate submitted by the Board of Directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. This vote also encom- passed approval by the Board of Governors of the establish- ment of a 1.75 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of June 16, 2022, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, other Federal Reserve Banks were informed of the Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 1.75 percent, effective June 16, 2022, for the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Minutes of the Meeting of June 14–15, 2022Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 26–27, 2022.

Financial markets over the intermeeting period reflected elevated uncertainty about the outlook. Most market participants appeared to view a moderation of inflation and slower, but still positive, economic growth ahead as the most likely sce- nario. However, investors appeared to be increasingly attentive to downside risks to the economy in light of the potential for shocks from abroad and the continued upside surprises to inflation. On net, financial conditions eased modestly over the pe- riod but remained substantially tighter than at the start of the year. Treasury yields fell, reflecting expectations of slower growth as well as a decline in inflation com- pensation. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s sur- veys of primary dealers and market participants marked down their growth forecasts for 2022 and 2023 and at- tached higher odds than in the June survey to the possi- bility that the U.S. economy could enter a recession in coming quarters. Market participants perceived falling commodity prices—particularly for oil—and the FOMC’s commit- ment to bringing inflation down as pointing to lower in- flation ahead. Market-based measures of near-dated in- flation compensation declined and continued to suggest that inflation would ease in coming quarters. In the Desk surveys, respondents also expected inflation to de- cline substantially in 2023 but assigned meaningful prob- abilities to a wide range of potential outcomes, including scenarios involving continued elevated rates of inflation. Far-forward market-based measures of inflation com- 4 Attended Tuesday’s session only. 5 Attended from the discussion of the economic and financial situation through the end of Wednesday’s session. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ pensation fell over the period. These measures contin- ued to suggest that inflation would return over time to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In their assessment of the policy outlook, market partic- ipants expected significant policy tightening in coming meetings as the Committee continued to respond to the current elevated level of inflation. Nearly all respond- ents to the Desk survey anticipated a 75 basis point in- crease in the target range at the current meeting, and most expected a 50 basis point increase in September to follow. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate indicated a peak policy rate of around 3.4 percent, significantly lower than at the time of the June meeting. The market-implied path suggested expectations that the policy rate would fall thereafter. Most respondents to the Desk survey expected the federal funds rate to re- main above the survey’s longer-run policy rate of 2.4 percent through the end of 2024, but, on average, re- spondents placed significant probabilities on lower rate outcomes. Regarding developments abroad, central banks in ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs) had quickened the pace of policy tightening in order to address above-tar- get inflation. Eight advanced-economy central banks raised their policy rates over the period. Along lines sim- ilar to U.S. developments, market-implied policy rates in most AFEs fell at longer horizons and reflected expec- tations that policy rates would reach peak levels by early 2023. In contrast to central banks in other advanced economies, the Bank of Japan confirmed its commit- ment to accommodative policy. In this environment, the exchange value of the dollar appreciated further, surpas- sing its March 2020 peak against advanced-economy currencies. The deputy manager next turned to a discussion of money markets and Desk operations. The 75 basis point increase in the target range at the June meeting passed through fully to the federal funds rate and other over- night rates. Although downward pressure on overnight secured rates had persisted, the pronounced softness ob- served in the past intermeeting period had abated to some degree. The overnight reverse repurchase agree- ment (ON RRP) facility continued to support policy im- plementation, and balances remained elevated. The dep- uty manager anticipated that, in the near term, the evo- lution of take-up at the ON RRP facility would continue to depend on changes in the supply of safe, short-term investments, and the demand for such investments by money market mutual funds (MMMFs). ON RRP bal- ances were expected to decline over time as balance sheet runoff proceeded. The deputy manager noted that this process would involve adjustments across a number of markets and that the staff would continue to monitor developments in money markets closely. Regarding expectations for the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, market participants expected the Committee to increase the monthly caps on System Open Market Account (SOMA) redemptions beginning in September, as announced in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet issued in May. Treasury coupon principal payments would first fall below the $60 billion cap in September, with the re- mainder of redemptions met with maturities of Treasury bills. Paydowns of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were projected to fall below the higher Septem- ber cap of $35 billion beginning in September. The deputy manager ended with an update on SOMA net income. Staff projections suggested that net income would likely turn negative in coming months. That de- velopment would be reflected in a temporary deferred asset on Reserve Bank balance sheets. Any deferred as- set would not affect the Committee’s ability to imple- ment monetary policy, and the deferred asset would be extinguished over time as net income turned positive again in later years. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the July 26–27 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had declined over the first half of the year. How- ever, the labor market continued to be very tight, and labor demand remained strong. Consumer price infla- tion—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures (PCE)—remained elevated in May, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in June. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain in June at a pace that was similar to that seen in April and May. The unemployment rate was unchanged in June at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rate for African Americans moved lower in June, while the rate for His- panics was unchanged; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio both ticked _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 3 down in June. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, declined further in May but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.1 per- cent over the 12 months ending in June. Real goods exports edged down in May after growing robustly in March and April. Real goods imports con- tinued to step down from the exceptionally strong March readings, driven by declines in imports of con- sumer goods and capital goods. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete re- covery of international travel. The nominal U.S. inter- national trade deficit narrowed for a second consecutive month in May from its record size in March. The avail- able data suggest that net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.7 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.0 percent in May, 2.1 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In June, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 9.1 percent, while core CPI inflation was 5.9 percent over the same period. Survey-based measures of short- run inflation expectations remained elevated; by con- trast, some measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions moved lower in recent weeks. Available indicators suggested that real PCE rose at a modest pace in the second quarter, while business in- vestment, residential investment, and government pur- chases all posted declines. Manufacturing output moved lower in May and June, and forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity weakened broadly. Foreign economic growth slowed notably in the second quarter, as COVID-19-related lockdowns led to a sharp contraction in China and Russia’s war against Ukraine took a toll on foreign activity, especially in Europe. In- dicators for June showed the Chinese economy re- bounding as the lockdowns were eased. The global economy, however, continued to face headwinds from disruptions to the supply of energy, elevated political un- certainties in Europe, and tighter global monetary and financial conditions. Although most commodity prices moved lower from elevated levels in recent weeks, for- eign consumer price inflation continued to rise through June, mostly reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of price pres- sures to core goods and services. Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high infla- tion. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, nominal and real Treasury yields declined significantly, reportedly reflecting in- creased investor concerns about downside risks to the growth outlook as well as a decline in inflation compen- sation. Sovereign yields in AFEs declined notably. The market-implied federal funds rate path for the next few meetings rose but moved down noticeably at longer ho- rizons. Broad equity price indexes were higher, on net, while credit spreads widened. Major foreign equity price indexes edged higher, on net, and the exchange value of the dollar continued to appreciate. Amid the decline in Treasury yields, longer-term borrowing costs declined for households and businesses with higher credit ratings, and while credit availability remained generally available, it appeared to tighten for most businesses and some households. Broad equity price indexes were higher over the inter- meeting period, amid heightened volatility. Declines in interest rates likely supported stock prices over the pe- riod, while some positive earnings releases suggested to investors a less pessimistic corporate outlook. One- month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index— the VIX—decreased but remained significantly above its pre-pandemic levels. Yields on corporate bonds de- clined notably across the credit spectrum, but corporate bond spreads ended the period slightly wider. Spreads on municipal bonds widened slightly as yields declined by less than those of comparable-maturity Treasury se- curities. Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable since the previous FOMC meeting, with the June in- crease in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates pass- ing through promptly to overnight money markets. Se- cured overnight rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill is- suance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the near- term outlook for policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased. Spreads on lower-rated short-term commercial paper (CP) narrowed modestly, on net. Bank core deposit rates moved up very little in Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ response to the Federal Reserve’s increase in adminis- tered rates following the June FOMC meeting, while MMMFs’ net yields rose, reflecting the increases in short-term rates over recent months. Investors’ concerns about global economic growth in- tensified amid weaker-than-expected data on economic activity and uncertainty about the supply of natural gas from Russia to Europe. Sovereign yields and medium- term inflation compensation measures in major AFEs, most notably in the euro area, moved down, with yields largely reversing the sharp increase that occurred just be- fore the June FOMC meeting. In the euro area, periph- eral sovereign spreads were little changed following the widely anticipated announcement by the European Cen- tral Bank of its Transmission Protection Instrument that could be activated to counter disorderly conditions in euro-area bond markets. Major foreign equity price in- dexes were volatile but generally edged higher, on net, supported by declines in sovereign yields. The dollar ap- preciated somewhat further against most currencies and particularly against the euro as yield differentials between the United States and the euro area widened. Most Latin American currencies depreciated against the dollar, in part reflecting the decline in global commodity prices. In domestic credit markets, longer-term borrowing costs for households and businesses with higher credit ratings declined over the intermeeting period but borrowing costs for lower rated firms were higher, on net. The credit quality of businesses, municipalities, and house- holds remained stable. Credit remained generally avail- able, though credit availability appeared to tighten for most businesses and for some households. Borrowing costs linked to shorter-term interest rates generally increased, largely as a result of expectations of tighter monetary policy. Bank interest rates for both commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real es- tate (CRE) loans increased in May and were close to pre- pandemic levels. Yields on institutional leveraged loans and newly issued commercial mortgage-backed securi- ties (CMBS) increased amid financial market volatility and growing concerns about an economic slowdown. Small businesses that borrow on a regular basis faced notably higher borrowing costs in June. Interest rates on most existing credit card accounts and on auto loans continued to trend upward. In contrast to many other borrowing rates, residential mortgage rates fell since the June FOMC meeting, in line with the drop in longer- term yields, but remained near their highest levels since 2010. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained strong with low volumes of defaults on corporate bonds in May and on leveraged loans in June. The volume of rating downgrades on speculative-grade credit in the cor- porate bond market was similar to that of upgrades in June, while for leveraged loans, the volume of down- grades exceeded the volume of upgrades in May and June. The credit quality for C&I and CRE loans on banks’ books remained sound. However, respondents in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicated increased con- cerns about credit quality in the near future as reasons for their expectation of a tightening in lending standards over the second half of 2022. Delinquency rates on CRE loans in CMBS declined in June, delinquency rates on small business loans were little changed, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong. The credit quality of households stayed solid. Residential mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance trended down. Credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose somewhat over the first quarter but remained subdued by recent historical standards. Business loans at banks expanded at a rapid pace in May and June, despite higher interest rates and a more uncer- tain economic outlook. C&I loans on banks’ books con- tinued to grow robustly, with the July SLOOS citing rea- sons of increased demand by customers to finance in- ventory and accounts receivable. However, issuance of both agency and non-agency CMBS slowed significantly in June. Credit appeared to be available to most small businesses, although the share of small firms reporting that it was difficult to obtain loans increased. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained widely availa- ble for borrowers with higher credit ratings but tight for households with low credit scores. Volumes of home- purchase mortgage originations declined in May and mortgage refinance volumes continued to fall. Con- sumer credit remained broadly available to households in April and May but respondents in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations indicated that it was harder to get credit in recent months. That said, auto loans outstanding continued to grow at a robust pace in April and May but credit card balances moderated somewhat in May and June. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate, down from notable in January. Equity and corporate debt prices declined significantly since the last assessment, reflecting concerns over slower _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 5 growth and lower risk appetite in corporate markets. Declining risk appetite has also led to sharp declines in the price of some digital assets. The staff noted that dig- ital assets tended to be volatile. The staff also high- lighted the financial stability considerations associated with rapid growth in stablecoins, including their vulner- ability to runs and the opacity of many aspects of their operations. Residential real estate prices continued to rise, and the staff noted that although valuations have been elevated, mortgage underwriting standards have been stronger than in previous house-price cycles. CRE prices continued to rise, and valuation pressures ap- peared to be increasing. The staff assessed that households were in a better posi- tion than in the mid-2000s to weather a downturn in house prices, noting that mortgage debt growth has sig- nificantly lagged growth in house prices, leaving house- holds with substantial equity cushions. Moreover, for much of the past decade, most new mortgage debt had been added by borrowers with prime credit scores. In addition, the staff assessed that business leverage was high, but businesses maintained ample cash on hand and their credit quality remained strong. Further, the ability of most firms to service their debt was at a historically high level, as measured by the interest coverage ratio. The staff assessed that leverage in the financial sector remained moderate. Recent declines in bank capital ra- tios were due to higher volatility, interest rate increases, and loan growth, but the recently concluded stress tests suggested that participating banks could absorb losses from a severe recession without breaching regulatory minimums, and some banks were expected to increase their capital ratios later this year. Leverage at hedge funds and life insurance companies remained relatively high. Market liquidity had deteriorated in the oil and equities markets since January, but market functioning continued to be orderly. Yields offered by MMMFs were well above those offered by banks, and the staff noted that this yield differential would attract inflows to MMMFs. Noting the structural vulnerabilities associated with MMMFs, the staff highlighted the need to monitor the size and fragility of this sector and the progress of the Security and Exchange Commission’s recently proposed reforms. The staff noted that open-end bond and loan mutual funds, which are also vulnerable to large-scale in- vestor withdrawals, had experienced outflows as interest rates rose. These outflows had proceeded in an orderly manner. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was noticeably weaker than the June forecast, reflecting the economy’s reduced momentum and current and prospective finan- cial conditions that were expected to provide less sup- port to aggregate demand growth. As a result, while the projected level of real GDP remained above potential this year, the gap was expected to have closed by the sec- ond half of 2023. Similarly, the unemployment rate was projected to start rising in the second half of 2022 and to reach the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of next year. Total PCE price inflation was expected to be 4.8 percent in 2022, and core inflation was expected to be 4.0 per- cent. Core PCE price inflation was expected to step down to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024; the projected deceleration in core prices was attributable to the anticipated resolution of supply–demand imbal- ances, a labor market that was expected to become less tight over the projection period, and a projected decline in import price inflation. Total PCE inflation was ex- pected to decline to 2.2 percent in 2023 and to 1.9 per- cent in 2024, reflecting the anticipated slowing in core inflation and a projected rapid deceleration in consumer food and energy prices in coming quarters. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside, noting that supply chain bottlenecks, Russia’s war against Ukraine, weak incoming data on spending, and the tightening in financial conditions since the start of the year supported this assessment. The staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside given the persistent upward surprises seen in the infla- tion data, the possibility that inflation expectations would become unanchored as a result of the large in- crease in actual inflation over the past year, and the risk that supply conditions would not improve as much as the baseline projection assumed. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, re- flecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ economic hardship. Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic ac- tivity. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to current economic activity, participants noted that consumer expenditures, housing activity, business investment, and manufacturing production had all decelerated from the robust rates of growth seen in 2021. The labor market, however, remained strong. Participants observed that indicators of spending and production suggested that the second quarter of this year had seen a broad-based softening in economic activity. Many participants remarked that some of the slowing, particularly in the housing sector, reflected the emerging response of aggregate demand to the tightening of finan- cial conditions associated with the ongoing firming of monetary policy. The unwinding of the large-scale sup- port to consumer spending provided by pandemic-re- lated fiscal policy actions, the inflation-induced reduc- tion in real disposable income, and the move down in the demand for some products from the elevated levels seen in earlier stages of the pandemic had also all led to slower growth in households’ expenditures. In addition, a deterioration in the foreign economic outlook and a strong dollar were contributing to a weakening of exter- nal demand. Participants anticipated that U.S. real GDP would expand in the second half of the year, but many expected that growth in economic activity would be at a below-trend pace, as the period ahead would likely see the response of aggregate demand to tighter financial conditions become stronger and more broad based. Par- ticipants noted that a period of below-trend GDP growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the Commit- tee’s objectives of maximum employment and price sta- bility. In their discussion of the household sector, participants commented that they were seeing many signs in the data, and hearing reports from business contacts, of slower growth in consumer spending. Although the aggregate balance sheet for the household sector was strong and the unemployment rate was low, consumer sentiment had deteriorated, and households were reportedly be- coming more cautious in their expenditure decisions in light of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the reduction in purchasing power induced by price rises, particularly increases in the prices of essentials such as food, housing, and transportation. Participants also ob- served that housing activity had weakened notably, re- flecting the impact of higher mortgage interest rates and house prices on home affordability. Participants antici- pated that this slowdown in housing activity would con- tinue and also expected higher borrowing costs to lead to a slowing in other interest-sensitive household ex- penditures, such as purchases of durable goods. With respect to the business sector, participants noted that investment spending had likely declined in the sec- ond quarter. In addition, business survey data and infor- mation received from contacts indicated that manufac- turing orders and production had fallen in some Dis- tricts. Heightened uncertainty, concerns about inflation, tighter financial conditions, and a cutback in consumer spending had led firms to downgrade economic pro- spects. Some participants noted that their contacts were reporting that businesses were in the process of reevalu- ating their capital expenditure plans, though a few par- ticipants stated that some contacts had reported a degree of short-term momentum in business activity arising from existing orders and from the implementation of ex- pansion plans made before the tightening of financial conditions. A few participants indicated that some busi- ness contacts had assessed that demand and supply were beginning to come into better balance. Even so, con- tacts in many areas continued to report major supply chain disruptions and anticipated that these were likely to continue while also indicating that there were signs of improvement in supply conditions in some areas. Participants observed that the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate very low, job vacan- cies and quits close to historically high levels, and an el- evated rate of nominal wage growth. Many participants also noted, however, that there were some tentative signs of a softening outlook for the labor market: These signs included increases in weekly initial unemployment insurance claims, reductions in quit rates and vacancies, slower growth in payrolls than earlier in the year, and reports of cutbacks in hiring in some sectors. In addi- tion, although nominal wage growth remained strong ac- cording to a wide range of measures, there were some signs of a leveling off or edging down. In some Districts, contacts had suggested that labor demand–supply imbal- ances might be diminishing, with firms being more suc- cessful in hiring and retaining workers and under less pressure to raise wages. Some participants noted that the contribution that increases in labor supply could make to reducing labor market imbalances was likely limited, especially as the scope for labor force participa- tion to pick up was constrained by the ongoing move- ment of the large baby-boom cohort into their retire- ment years, while others highlighted factors holding down participation that could wane in the future, such _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 7 as continuing pandemic-related concerns. Participants observed that, in part because of tighter financial condi- tions and an associated moderation in the growth of ag- gregate demand, growth in employment would likely slow further in the period ahead. They noted that this development would help bring labor demand and supply into better balance, reducing upward pressures on nom- inal wage growth and aiding the return of inflation to 2 percent. Several participants observed that the mod- eration in labor market conditions might well lag the slowdown in economic activity. Participants remarked that a moderation in labor market conditions would likely involve a decline in the number of job openings as well as a moderate increase in unemployment from the current very low rate. A couple of participants indicated that firms were keen to retain workers—a factor that could limit the increase in layoffs associated with a slow- ing labor market. Participants noted that indicators of spending and pro- duction pointed to less underlying strength in economic activity than was suggested by indicators of labor market activity. With employment growth still strong, the weak- ening in spending data implied unusually large negative readings on labor productivity growth for the year so far. Participants remarked that the strength of the labor mar- ket suggested that economic activity may be stronger than implied by the current GDP data, with several par- ticipants raising the possibility that the discrepancy might ultimately be resolved by GDP being revised up- ward. Several participants also observed, however, that the labor market might not be as tight as some indicators suggested, and they noted that data provided by the pay- roll processor ADP and employment as reported in the household survey both seemed to imply a softer labor market than that suggested by the still-robust growth in payroll employment as reported in the establishment survey. Participants observed that inflation remained unaccept- ably high and was well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent. In light of the high CPI reading for June, participants noted that PCE inflation was likely to have increased further in that month. Participants further observed that inflationary pressures were broad based, a pattern reflected in large one-month increases in the trimmed mean CPI and core CPI measures. Par- ticipants remarked that, although recent declines in gas- oline prices would likely help produce lower headline in- flation rates in the short term, declines in the prices of oil and some other commodities could not be relied on as providing a basis for sustained lower inflation, as these prices could quickly rebound. Participants also noted that the high cost of living was an especially great burden on low- and middle-income households. Partic- ipants agreed that there was little evidence to date that inflation pressures were subsiding. They judged that in- flation would respond to monetary policy tightening and the associated moderation in economic activity with a delay and would likely stay uncomfortably high for some time. Participants also observed that in some product categories, the rate of price increase could well pick up further in the short run, with sizable additional increases in residential rental expenses being especially likely. Participants noted that supply bottlenecks were contin- uing to contribute to price pressures. There were, how- ever, some signs of gradual improvement in the supply situation—including improved availability of certain key materials, less upward pressure on input prices, and a de- cline in delivery times. Contacts reported that there were nevertheless substantial continuing challenges. Partici- pants judged that it would take considerable time for supply constraints to be resolved, and a few suggested that full resolution of supply difficulties would take longer than they previously assessed. Several partici- pants stressed that improvements in supply would be helpful but by themselves could not be relied on to re- solve the supply and demand imbalances in the economy sufficiently rapidly. Participants emphasized that a slow- ing in aggregate demand would play an important role in reducing inflation pressures. They expected that the ap- propriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring in- flation back down to levels consistent with the Commit- tee’s longer-run objective and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Participants discussed a number of factors likely to be helpful in bringing infla- tion back down to 2 percent. In addition to the Com- mittee’s ongoing policy firming and anchored longer- term inflation expectations, these included competitive pressures restraining price increases, the apparent ab- sence of a wage–price spiral, the tightening of monetary policy abroad, and the impact of the appreciation of the dollar on import prices. However, they continued to view commodity price developments as a potential source of upward pressure on inflation. Participants noted that expectations of inflation were an important influence on the behavior of actual inflation and stressed that moving to an appropriately restrictive stance of policy was essential for avoiding an unanchor- ing of inflation expectations. Such an unanchoring would make achieving the Committee’s statutory objec- tives of maximum employment and price stability much more difficult. In assessing the current state of inflation Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ expectations, participants noted that recent readings on market-based measures of inflation compensation were consistent with longer-term inflation expectations re- maining anchored near 2 percent. They judged that this behavior of longer-term inflation expectations was likely partly due to the actual and expected firming of mone- tary policy and also likely reflected downward revisions to the growth of aggregate demand expected in coming years. In addition, several participants assessed that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening was helping alleviate concerns among market participants and wage and price setters that elevated inflation would become entrenched. Several participants observed that recent readings on survey measures of inflation expecta- tions were broadly consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective, although a few participants noted that household surveys were indicat- ing increasing divergences in views about the likely longer-run rate of inflation. In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both infla- tion and inflation expectations. Uncertainty about the medium-term course of inflation remained high, and the balance of inflation risks remained skewed to the upside, with several participants highlighting the possibility of further supply shocks arising from commodity markets. Participants saw the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth as primarily being to the downside. These down- side risks included the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated, that there would be further pandemic-related economic disruptions, or that geopolitical and global economic developments would lead to additional adverse economic or financial disturbances. Several of the participants who commented on issues re- lated to financial stability noted that, on balance, asset valuations had eased from elevated levels in recent months. High levels of capital and liquidity overall in the banking system, healthy household balance sheets, and the adoption of stronger mortgage underwriting standards following the Global Financial Crisis were also cited among the factors that fostered financial stability in the current environment. Several participants noted that financial market liquidity had been low in some ar- eas but that market functioning had, nonetheless, been orderly. Several participants emphasized the importance of avoiding complacency when assessing financial vul- nerabilities amid ever-changing economic and financial landscapes or the need to look at a broad range of pos- sible outcomes, including scenarios involving elevated inflation and rising interest rates, when assessing finan- cial vulnerabilities and stability. Some participants com- mented on the financial stability challenges posed by dig- ital assets. They noted that these assets, including sta- blecoins, were subject to vulnerabilities—such as runs, fire sales, and excessive leverage—similar to those asso- ciated with more traditional assets. While the recent tur- moil in digital asset markets had not spread to other asset classes, these participants saw digital assets’ rising im- portance and growing interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system as underscoring the need to establish a robust supervisory and regulatory framework for this industry that would appropriately limit potential systemic risks. A few participants men- tioned the need to strengthen the oversight and regula- tion of certain types of nonbank financial institutions. Several participants noted that capital at some of the largest banks had declined in recent quarters. These par- ticipants emphasized that it was important that the larg- est banks have strong capital positions and that appro- priate settings of regulatory and supervisory tools can help deliver that outcome. A couple of these partici- pants highlighted the potential role that usage of the countercyclical capital buffer could play in this context. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants noted that recent indicators of spending and production had softened, while, by contrast, job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appro- priate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the pro- cess of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities hold- ings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. Participants observed that, following this meeting’s policy rate hike, the nominal federal funds rate would be within the range of their estimates of its longer-run neutral level. Even so, with inflation elevated and expected to remain so over the near term, some par- ticipants emphasized that the real federal funds rate would likely still be below shorter-run neutral levels after this meeting’s policy rate hike. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 9 would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objec- tives. With inflation remaining well above the Commit- tee’s objective, participants judged that moving to a re- strictive stance of policy was required to meet the Com- mittee’s legislative mandate to promote maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants concurred that the pace of policy rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and risks to the outlook. Participants judged that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation. Some participants indicated that, once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level, it likely would be appropriate to maintain that level for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 percent. Participants concurred that, in expeditiously raising the policy rate, the Committee was acting with resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and anchor inflation expec- tations at levels consistent with that longer-run goal. Participants noted that the Committee’s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objec- tive, together with its forceful policy actions and com- munications, had already contributed to a notable tight- ening of financial conditions that would likely help re- duce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate de- mand. Participants pointed to some evidence suggesting that policy actions and communications about the future path of the federal funds rate were starting to affect the economy, most visibly in interest-sensitive sectors. Par- ticipants generally judged that the bulk of the effects on real activity had yet to be felt because of lags associated with the transmission of monetary policy, and that while a moderation in economic growth should support a re- turn of inflation to 2 percent, the effects of policy firm- ing on consumer prices were not yet apparent in the data. A number of participants posited that some of the effects of policy actions and communications were showing up more rapidly than had historically been the case, because the expeditious removal of policy accom- modation and supporting communications already had led to a significant tightening of financial conditions. In light of elevated inflation and the upside risks to the outlook for inflation, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of the policy rate in the near term would also be appropriate from a risk-management per- spective because it would better position the Committee to raise the policy rate further, to appropriately restric- tive levels, if inflation were to run higher than expected. Participants judged that a significant risk facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become en- trenched if the public began to question the Committee’s resolve to adjust the stance of policy sufficiently. If this risk materialized, it would complicate the task of return- ing inflation to 2 percent and could raise substantially the economic costs of doing so. Many participants re- marked that, in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in monetary policy’s effect on the econ- omy, there was also a risk that the Committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability. These participants highlighted this risk as underscoring the importance of the Commit- tee’s data-dependent approach to judging the pace and magnitude of policy firming over coming quarters. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to re- turning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Participants agreed that a return of inflation to the 2 per- cent objective was necessary for sustaining a strong labor market. Participants remarked that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Commit- tee’s objective. Participants added that the course of in- flation would be influenced by various nonmonetary fac- tors, including developments associated with Russia’s war against Ukraine and with supply chain disruptions. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators of spending and production had softened. Members also concurred that, nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low. Mem- bers agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pres- sures. In describing the sources of elevated inflation, members judged it pertinent to add a reference to higher food prices to the statement because of the notable rise in these prices and the importance of food items in households’ budgets. Members concurred that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ were weighing on global economic activity. Members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Amid evidence that COVID-related lockdowns in China had generally been lifted and had affected supply chains only modestly, members generally considered it appropriate to omit from the July statement the sentence that appeared in the June statement indicating that these lockdowns were likely to exacerbate supply chain disrup- tions. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, mem- bers agreed that the Committee would continue reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in May. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of in- formation, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. Members affirmed that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective July 28, 2022, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 2.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 2.3 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in the calendar months of July and August that ex- ceeds a cap of $30 billion per month. Re- deem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Starting in the calendar month of Septem- ber, roll over at auction the amount of prin- cipal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are the monthly cap. than less • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in the calendar months of July and August that exceeds a cap of $17.5 billion per month. • Starting in the calendar month of Septem- ber, reinvest into agency MBS the amount of principal payments from the Federal Re- serve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 26–27, 2022Page 11 The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate has remained low. Inflation re- mains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the tar- get range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Esther L. George, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J.

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Andrei Zlate, Group Manager, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of fi- nancial market developments over the intermeeting pe- riod. U.S. financial conditions tightened over the period, largely reflecting an upward revision in investors’ out- look for the path of the policy rate. Treasury yields climbed substantially, with most of the upward move re- flected in real yields. Equity prices initially rose amid second-quarter earnings reports that were better than feared but later retraced those gains in response to the shifting policy outlook. Regarding international devel- opments, yields in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also rose sharply as a number of other central banks lifted policy rates and indicated in their communi- cations that they would likely continue to tighten mone- tary policy in order to address inflation pressures. The exchange value of the dollar appreciated notably, reach- ing multidecade highs in real terms, as market partici- pants perceived mounting economic challenges abroad. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate shifted sharply higher after market participants interpreted Fed- eral Reserve communications—particularly those pro- vided at the Jackson Hole symposium—along with in- coming data, as indicating a more restrictive path of pol- icy than previously expected. Policy-sensitive rates sug- gested that a 75 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was widely expected to be de- cided on at the Committee’s September meeting, with some chance of a 100 basis point move. In addition, the market-implied path suggested reasonable odds of addi- tional 75 basis point and 50 basis point rate increases at the November and December meetings, respectively. Market participants generally anticipated a further slow- ing in the pace of rate increases after December, with the peak policy rate being reached in the first half of 2023. Beyond that period, the market-implied path of the fed- eral funds rate sloped downward, likely reflecting down- side risks to the policy rate path. The median respond- ent to the Open Market Desk surveys expected the pol- icy rate path to remain flat through 2023 after the peak rate was reached. On average, Desk survey respondents assigned an almost 30 percent probability to a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) over 2022, nearly double the probability assigned in the July survey. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of pol- icy implementation. Balance sheet runoff had continued to proceed smoothly over the intermeeting period. With caps on redemptions of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) doubling in Septem- ber, the pace of balance sheet runoff was set to increase over coming months. The markets for Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS continued to function in an orderly manner, though liquidity conditions in both markets re- mained low, reflecting elevated interest rate uncertainty. In money markets, the 75 basis point increase in the tar- get range at the July meeting passed through fully to overnight rates. Amid strong demand for short-term in- vestments, take-up at the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility was relatively steady at el- evated levels. The staff continued to anticipate that ON RRP take-up would decline in coming quarters from its currently ele- vated levels as money market participants responded to shifting conditions. Issuance of short-term securities was likely to increase in coming periods, and, as more clarity emerged in the economic and policy outlook, de- mand for short-term assets could moderate. Both of these developments would ease downward pressure on yields on safe short-term investments. The gradual re- duction in ON RRP balances could also be facilitated by rising competition among banks in seeking deposits. The manager pro tem indicated that the staff would con- tinue to monitor money market developments closely in order to assess whether any frictions were emerging in this process. The manager pro tem concluded with an update on op- erational matters. As expected, Federal Reserve net in- come turned negative in September. The staff expected that the size of the associated deferred asset would in- crease over time until net income turned positive, likely in a few years. The Desk planned to begin aggregation of those agency MBS held in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) that are not eligible to be commingled into Uniform MBS and, specifically, the Freddie Mac MBS that were issued before June 2019 and have a 45-day payment delay; decisions about any additional ag- gregations would be made at a later date. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Septem- ber 20–21 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was in- creasing at a modest pace in the third quarter after hav- ing declined over the first half of the year. Labor de- mand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight. Recent monthly readings indicated that consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal con- sumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted robust gains in July and August at an average pace that was only slightly below what was seen over the first half of the year. The unemployment rate edged up, on net, from 3.6 percent in June to 3.7 percent in August. The unem- ployment rate for African Americans increased over this period, while the rate for Hispanics moved up slightly on net; both rates were noticeably higher than the national average. The labor force participation rate and employment-to-population ratio both rose, on net, from June to August. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Sur- vey, moved slightly lower from May to July but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid and broad based: Average hourly earnings rose 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while the employment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.5 percent over the 12 months ending in June, 2.4 per- centage points faster than the year-earlier pace. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in July, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.6 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.4 percent in July. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 8.3 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.3 percent over the same period. Survey-based measures of short-run inflation expecta- tions declined in recent weeks, while measures of longer- term inflation expectations remained roughly stable or moved lower. Available spending indicators, including the August re- tail sales report, suggested that real PCE was on track to post a modest gain in the third quarter. However, the latest housing market data pointed to another sharp con- traction in residential investment in the third quarter, and business fixed investment appeared to be rising at a tepid pace. Real goods exports stepped up in June and then rose fur- ther in July, led by increases in exports of industrial sup- plies. By contrast, real goods imports stepped down in June and then fell sharply in July, driven by a large de- cline in consumer goods imports. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. inter- national trade deficit continued to narrow in June and July. Altogether, net exports contributed positively to GDP growth in the second quarter and appeared on track to make another positive contribution in the third quarter. Data pointed to weak foreign growth in recent months, weighed down by the global reverberations from Rus- sia’s war against Ukraine and a loss of momentum in the Chinese economy. In Europe, further disruptions to the supply of energy exacerbated declines in real disposable incomes and in consumer and business confidence, re- straining economic activity. In China, recent indicators suggest only a partial rebound from the effects of earlier severe COVID-19-related lockdowns as well as increas- ing concerns about the property sector. Weaker growth in China and the broader global economy also weighed on export-oriented emerging market economies in Asia. Consumer price inflation rose further in August in many foreign economies, reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of in- flationary pressure to core prices. With inflation persis- tently high, many central banks continued to tighten monetary policy. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved higher. Broad domestic equity price indexes decreased slightly, on balance, but market volatility remained ele- vated. Credit remained widely available to most types of borrowers, but increases in borrowing costs appeared to damp the demand for credit in some markets in recent months. Measures of current loan performance for businesses and most households remained generally sta- ble. However, more recently, expectations of future credit quality for businesses deteriorated slightly, and de- linquency rates rose for some types of credit owed by households with low credit scores. The expected path of the federal funds rate—implied by a straight read of financial market quotes—rose in the period since the July FOMC meeting, largely reflecting Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ more-restrictive-than-expected monetary policy com- munications amid stronger-than-expected economic data and ongoing concerns about high inflation. On net, nominal Treasury yields increased significantly across the maturity spectrum. The increases in nominal Treas- ury yields were primarily accounted for by rising real yields, while inflation compensation measures declined substantially at short horizons and remained relatively little changed at medium- and longer-term horizons. Broad equity price indexes decreased slightly, on net, as substantial early gains arising from investors’ improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and better-than- feared second-quarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the Committee would follow a more restrictive policy than previously expected. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased somewhat, on net, and remained elevated by historical norms, partly reflecting investor uncertainty and risks associated with higher in- flation and the expected move to a restrictive policy stance. Corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly, on net, and remained roughly at the midpoints of their his- torical distributions. Reflecting increases in both policy rates and corporate bond spreads, yields on corporate bonds rose significantly since the start of the year. Mu- nicipal bond spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened a touch. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the July increase in the Federal Reserve’s administered interest rates pass- ing through quickly to other money market rates. Al- though secured overnight rates firmed slightly later in the intermeeting period, they remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate—a configuration that market participants attributed to relatively low Treasury bill sup- ply combined with strong investor demand for short- dated instruments amid uncertainty about the future path of the policy rate. Consistent with continued soft- ness in repurchase agreement rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated. Spreads on lower- rated short-term commercial paper changed little on net. Bank deposit rates continued to increase modestly in August, following a lagged response to increases in the federal funds rate, while money market mutual funds’ net yields rose along with the increases in short-term rates. Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose notably over the in- termeeting period as major central banks raised their policy rates and communicated a tighter stance of future policy in the face of persistent inflationary pressures. Yields on Japanese government securities, however, ended the period little changed, as the Bank of Japan re- affirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Measures of foreign inflation compensation were vola- tile amid large swings in European natural gas prices but increased moderately on net. The U.S. dollar appreci- ated further against most major currencies, reaching multi-decade highs against the euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. The dollar’s strength largely re- flected increasing investor concerns about the global growth outlook as well as widening interest rate differ- entials between the United States and Japan. Growth concerns also weighed on foreign equity prices, which declined moderately. Outflows from funds dedicated to emerging markets continued at a modest pace, and credit spreads in emerging market economies narrowed some- what on net. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period. Yields on both cor- porate bonds and institutional leveraged loans increased. Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share of firms facing higher borrowing costs contin- ued to climb through August. Municipal bond yields in- creased across ratings categories. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased and reached their highest levels since 2008. Interest rates on most credit card accounts continued to move higher, in line with the rise in the federal funds rate, and auto loan interest rates rose steadily through August. Credit remained generally available to businesses and households, but high borrowing costs appeared to re- duce the demand for credit, resulting in lower financing volumes in some markets. Issuance of nonfinancial cor- porate bonds slowed further in July from the weak levels seen in the second quarter but rebounded somewhat in August and so far in September. Gross institutional lev- eraged loan issuance increased modestly in July from subdued levels but continued to be weak in August. Eq- uity issuance remained depressed, while issuance of mu- nicipal bonds was sluggish over the summer and so far in September. According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Sur- vey on Bank Lending Practices, banks tightened credit standards on C&I lending for the first time in two years, but C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets expanded at a strong pace in July and August, reflecting strong demand from nonfinancial businesses. CRE loans on banks’ bal- Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ance sheets also continued to grow robustly, but issu- ance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) slowed in July from its strong pace earlier in the year. Credit availability to small businesses appeared to be tightening somewhat. The share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain loans continued its upward trend in August but remained lower than its his- torical average. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained avail- able for high-credit-score borrowers. Credit availability for low-credit-score borrowers continued to ease through July but remained modestly tight—close to pre- pandemic averages. However, the volumes of both home-purchase and refinance mortgage originations plunged in July amid rising mortgage rates. Consumer credit remained available to most households in June and July, but about half of the respondents in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Ex- pectations indicated that it was harder to obtain credit than it was a year earlier and that they expected it to be- come even harder over the next year. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained generally strong, with low default rates for both corpo- rate bonds and leveraged loans. The volume of rating upgrades in the corporate bond market outpaced that of downgrades in July and August, but, so far in September, these relative volumes reversed. The volume of rating downgrades in the leveraged loan market continued to exceed that of upgrades. Credit quality for C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets also remained sound, as delinquency rates remained at low levels through June. However, banks increased loan loss pro- visions somewhat in the second quarter. Delinquency rates on CRE loans securitized into CMBS remained un- changed in July, delinquency rates on small business loans stayed quite low after edging up, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong. Household credit quality stayed broadly solid but con- tinued to worsen for some types of credit owed by bor- rowers with low credit scores. Mortgage delinquencies trended down in recent months, and the share of mort- gages in foreclosure remained low in July. By contrast, credit card and auto credit delinquency rates rose over the second quarter, particularly among subprime bor- rowers, with subprime auto loan delinquency rates re- bounding notably to slightly above their historical aver- ages. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was slightly weaker than the July forecast. However, the staff’s esti- mate of potential output in recent history was revised down significantly in response to continued disappoint- ing productivity growth and the sluggish gains in labor force participation seen so far this year; moreover, this lower trajectory for potential output was expected to persist throughout the forecast period. As a result, the staff’s estimate of the output gap was revised up consid- erably this year, and while the staff projection still had the output gap closing in coming years, the level of out- put was expected to be slightly above potential at the end of 2025. Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to rise more slowly than in the July projection and to be slightly below the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of 2025. On a 12-month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.1 percent in 2022, and core infla- tion was expected to be 4.3 percent. Although the staff continued to project that core inflation would step down over the next two years—reflecting the anticipated reso- lution of supply–demand imbalances and a labor market that was expected to become less tight—core inflation was revised up in each year of the projection. In 2025, core inflation was expected to be 2.1 percent. Total PCE price inflation was expected to decline to 2.6 per- cent in 2023 as core inflation slowed and energy prices declined. Total PCE inflation was expected to move down further in 2024, to 2 percent, and to remain at 2 percent in 2025. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside. In addition to Russia’s war in Ukraine, weakening activ- ity abroad, and ongoing supply chain bottlenecks, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater-than-assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was viewed by the staff as a salient downside risk to their forecast for real activity. The staff viewed the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside on the grounds that supply conditions might not improve as much as expected and energy prices might rise sharply again. The staff also pointed to the possibility that wage increases could put a greater-than- expected amount of upward pressure on price inflation and the possibility that inflation expectations could be- come unanchored given the large rise in inflation seen over the past year as additional upside risks to the infla- tion forecast. Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2025 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Inflation remained ele- vated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Participants judged that the war and related events were creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Against this background, participants remained highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent data pointed to modest growth in economic activity over the second half of this year. Participants observed that recent indicators of consumer spending and business investment suggested modest increases in those spending categories but noted that activity in in- terest-sensitive sectors weakened appreciably. Partici- pants revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year from their projections in June. Sev- eral participants noted that the continued strength in the labor market, as well as the data on gross domestic in- come, raised the possibility that the current GDP data could understate the strength in economic activity this year. Participants generally anticipated that the U.S. economy would grow at a below-trend pace in this and the coming few years, with the labor market becoming less tight, as monetary policy assumed a restrictive stance and global headwinds persisted. Participants noted that a period of below-trend real GDP growth would help reduce inflationary pressures and set the stage for the sustained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that consumer spending grew moderately, reflect- ing strength in the labor market, the elevated level of household savings accumulated during the pandemic, and a strong aggregate household-sector balance sheet. Several participants noted that spending appeared to have held up relatively well, especially among higher-in- come households. These participants also noted that the composition of spending by low-to-moderate-income households—who were affected to a greater degree by high food, energy, and shelter prices—was changing, with discretionary expenditures being cut and purchases shifting to lower-cost options. Participants observed that the notable slowdown in residential investment and other interest-sensitive spending had continued, reflect- ing the effect of the Committee’s monetary policy ac- tions and tighter financial conditions. With regard to the business sector, participants observed that growth in investment spending appeared modest. Several participants mentioned that manufacturing activ- ity had slowed. A couple of participants noted that busi- nesses were constrained in undertaking new capital pro- jects, as they faced higher financing costs, persistent challenges associated with supply bottlenecks, and hiring difficulties resulting from the continued tightness of the labor market. Participants discussed how they perceived challenging supply conditions to be evolving. Many participants re- marked that their business contacts were reporting signs of relief in supply bottlenecks, such as declines in ship- ping costs and delivery times and rising inventories, while several participants saw little improvement in the supply situation. Participants saw supply bottlenecks as likely continuing for a while longer, and a couple com- mented that constraints on production were increasingly taking the form of labor shortages rather than parts shortages. Participants observed that the labor market had re- mained very tight, as evidenced by a historically low un- employment rate, elevated job vacancies and quit rates, a low pace of layoffs, robust employment gains, and high nominal wage growth. A few participants remarked that employers facing particularly acute labor shortages were those associated with professional occupations, service industries, skilled trades, and smaller firms. Some par- ticipants noted a number of developments consistent with the labor market moving toward better balance, in- cluding a lower rate of job turnover, a moderation in em- ployment growth, and an increase in the labor force par- ticipation rate for prime-age workers. However, several Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ participants assessed that the scope for further improve- ment in labor force participation was likely limited, es- pecially in view of the sizable contribution that retire- ments had made to the previous decline in the participa- tion rate. Participants anticipated that the supply and demand im- balances in the labor market would gradually diminish and the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat, importantly reflecting the effects of tighter monetary policy. Participants judged that a softening in the labor market would be needed to ease upward pressures on wages and prices. Participants expected that the transi- tion toward a softer labor market would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate. Several com- mented that they considered it likely that the transition would occur primarily through reduced job vacancies and slower job creation. A couple of participants re- marked that, in light of challenges in hiring, businesses might be less willing to reduce their staffing levels in the event of a weakening in general economic activity. A few participants particularly stressed the high uncer- tainty associated with the expected future path of the un- employment rate and commented that the unemploy- ment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast. Participants observed that inflation remained unaccept- ably high and well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Participants commented that recent inflation data generally had come in above expectations and that, correspondingly, inflation was declining more slowly than they had previously been anticipating. Price pressures had remained elevated and had persisted across a broad array of product categories. Energy prices had declined in recent months but remained con- siderably higher than in 2021, and upside risks to energy prices remained. Several participants noted the contin- ued elevated rates of increase in core goods prices. These participants considered this development as po- tentially indicating that the shift of household spending from goods to services might be having a smaller effect on goods prices than they expected or that the supply bottlenecks and labor shortages were taking longer to be resolved. Participants commented that they expected in- flation pressures to persist in the near term. Numerous contributing factors were cited as supporting this view, including labor market tightness and the resulting up- ward pressure on nominal wages, continuing supply chain disruptions, and the persistent nature of increases in services prices, particularly shelter prices. With respect to the medium term, participants judged that inflation pressures would gradually recede in com- ing years. Various factors were cited as likely to contrib- ute to this outcome, including the Committee’s tighten- ing of its policy stance, a gradual easing of supply and demand imbalances in labor and product markets, and the likelihood that weaker consumer demand would re- sult in a reduction of business profit margins from their current elevated levels. A few participants reported that business contacts in certain retail sectors—such as used cars and apparel—were planning to cut prices in order to help reduce their inventories. Several participants commented that while households across the income distribution were burdened by elevated inflation, those at the lower end of the income distribution were partic- ularly harmed, as a larger share of their income was spent on housing and other necessities. In assessing inflation expectations, participants noted that longer-term expectations appeared to remain well anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters as well as measures obtained from financial markets. Participants remarked that the Committee’s affirmation of its strong commitment to its price-stability objective, together with its forceful policy actions, had likely helped keep longer- run inflation expectations anchored. Some stressed that a more prolonged period of elevated inflation would in- crease the risk of inflation expectations becoming unan- chored, making it much more costly to bring inflation down. A few participants discussed the increased dis- persion of longer-term inflation expectations across re- spondents in various surveys, with an increase in the number of respondents reporting relatively low expecta- tions of future inflation acknowledged as a key driver of the increased dispersion but with a couple of participants citing higher inflation expectations among some survey respondents as a cause for concern and a reason not to be complacent about longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored. Participants agreed that the uncertainty associated with their economic outlooks was high and that risks to their inflation outlook were weighted to the upside. Some participants noted rising labor tensions, a new round of global energy price increases, further disruptions in sup- ply chains, and a larger-than-expected pass-through of wage increases into price increases as potential shocks that, if they materialized, could compound an already challenging inflation problem. A number of participants commented that a wage–price spiral had not yet devel- oped but cited its possible emergence as a risk. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants broadly judged the risks to real GDP growth to be weighted to the downside, with various global headwinds most prominently cited as contributing fac- tors. These global headwinds included heightened risk of recession in Europe, a slowdown in economic activity occurring in China, and the ongoing global economic implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Several participants noted that the monetary policy tightening under way in many other economies would affect global financial markets and foreign real GDP growth, with the potential for spillovers to the U.S. economy. In their consideration of the appropriate stance of mon- etary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants ob- served that recent indicators of production and spending had pointed to modest growth, while job gains had been robust and the unemployment rate had remained low. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Commit- tee issued in May. Policymakers observed that the rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee’s monetary policy stance sufficiently restric- tive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to bring inflation back to 2 percent. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective, with many stressing the importance of staying on this course even as the la- bor market slowed. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objec- tives. Participants judged that the Committee needed to move to, and then maintain, a more restrictive policy stance in order to meet the Committee’s legislative man- date to promote maximum employment and price stabil- ity. Many participants noted that, with inflation well above the Committee’s 2 percent objective and showing little sign so far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy continuing, they had raised their assessment of the path of the federal funds rate that would likely be needed to achieve the Committee’s goals. Participants judged that the pace and extent of policy rate increases would continue to depend on the implica- tions of incoming information for the outlook for eco- nomic activity and inflation and on risks to the outlook. Several participants noted that, particularly in the current highly uncertain global economic and financial environ- ment, it would be important to calibrate the pace of fur- ther policy tightening with the aim of mitigating the risk of significant adverse effects on the economic outlook. Participants observed that, as the stance of monetary policy tightened further, it would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjust- ments on economic activity and inflation. Many partici- pants indicated that, once the policy rate had reached a sufficiently restrictive level, it likely would be appropri- ate to maintain that level for some time until there was compelling evidence that inflation was on course to re- turn to the 2 percent objective. Participants noted that, in keeping with the Committee’s Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, balance sheet runoff had moved up to its maximum planned pace in September and would continue at that pace. They further observed that a significant reduction in the Committee’s holdings of securities was in progress and that this process was contributing to the move to a re- strictive policy stance. A couple of participants re- marked that, after the process of balance sheet reduction was well under way, it would be appropriate for the Committee to consider sales of agency MBS in order to enable suitable progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities. In their assessment of the effects of policy actions and communications to date, participants concurred that the Committee’s actions to raise expeditiously the target range for the federal funds rate demonstrated its resolve to lower inflation to 2 percent and to keep inflation ex- pectations anchored at levels consistent with that longer- run goal. Participants noted that the Committee’s com- mitment to restoring price stability, together with its pur- poseful policy actions and communications, had con- tributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions over the past year that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants observed that this tightening had led to substantial in- creases in real interest rates across the maturity spec- trum. Most participants remarked that, although some interest-sensitive categories of spending—such as hous- ing and business fixed investment—had already started to respond to the tightening of financial conditions, a sizable portion of economic activity had yet to display much response. They noted also that inflation had not yet responded appreciably to policy tightening and that a significant reduction in inflation would likely lag that Minutes of the Meeting of September 20–21, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ of aggregate demand. Participants observed that a pe- riod of real GDP growth below its trend rate, very likely accompanied by some softening in labor market condi- tions, was required. They agreed that, by moving its pol- icy purposefully toward an appropriately restrictive stance, the Committee would help ensure that elevated inflation did not become entrenched and that inflation expectations did not become unanchored. These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on eco- nomic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability. In light of the broad-based and unacceptably high level of inflation, the intermeeting news of higher-than- expected inflation, and upside risks to the inflation out- look, participants remarked that purposefully moving to a restrictive policy stance in the near term was consistent with risk-management considerations. Many partici- pants emphasized that the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of tak- ing too much action. Several participants underlined the need to maintain a restrictive stance for as long as nec- essary, with a couple of these participants stressing that historical experience demonstrated the danger of prem- aturely ending periods of tight monetary policy designed to bring down inflation. Several participants observed that as policy moved into restrictive territory, risks would become more two-sided, reflecting the emergence of the downside risk that the cumulative restraint in ag- gregate demand would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 percent. A few of these partic- ipants noted that this possibility was heightened by fac- tors beyond the Committee’s actions, including the tightening of monetary policy stances abroad and the weakening global economic outlook, that were also likely to restrain domestic economic activity in the period ahead. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation remained elevated, re- flecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members observed that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Members remarked that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In their assessment of the monetary policy stance neces- sary for achieving the Committee’s maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3¼ percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, mem- bers agreed that the Committee would continue reduc- ing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet issued in May. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. They also noted that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. Members affirmed that the Committee was strongly committed to returning in- flation to its 2 percent objective. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 22, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3 to 3¼ percent.  Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 3.25 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 3.05 percent and with a per-counterparty Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the limit of $160 billion per day; per-counterparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are the monthly cap. than less  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3 to 3¼ percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Com- mittee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to re- turning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Esther L. George, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 3.15 percent, effective September 22, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a ¾ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 3.25 percent, effective Sep- tember 22, 2022.6 6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Rich- mond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Gover- nors of the establishment of a 3.25 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of September 22, 2022, or the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Min- neapolis, and San Francisco were informed of the Board’s ap- proval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 3.25 percent, effective September 22, 2022.)

There was agreement that the Federal Re- serve can be effective only when there is a foundation of public trust. Participants reaffirmed the importance of holding themselves and their staffs accountable for knowing and following the high ethical standards that are set in the Committee’s policies, including those on financial transactions and disclosure and on external communications. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of fi- nancial market developments in the United States. Over Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the period, financial conditions had tightened amid ele- vated volatility across financial markets. The market-im- plied path of the policy rate rose, with the median federal funds rate values in the September Summary of Eco- nomic Projections and other Federal Reserve communi- cations being viewed by market participants as indicating a commitment to sustaining a restrictive monetary policy stance. With data received over the period also indicat- ing higher-than-expected core inflation, market partici- pants placed high odds on a 75 basis point increase in the target range at the current meeting. Nonetheless, contacts were increasingly focused on the question of when the Committee might slow the pace of future in- creases in light of the substantial tightening of financial conditions that had occurred over the year. Most re- spondents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys viewed a 50 basis point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting as the most likely outcome. On net, nominal Treasury yields ended the period higher, reflecting both an upward revision in the expected path of the policy rate and higher estimated term premiums. Investment-grade bond yields and mortgage interest rates moved up as well, to the highest levels in many years. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of vol- atility in global financial markets. In September, an ex- pansionary budget announced by the U.K. government resulted in an extraordinary rise in yields on gilts (long- dated U.K. government securities) and reduced gilt mar- ket liquidity. Reflecting its financial stability objective, the Bank of England initiated a temporary gilt purchase program designed to address disorderly market condi- tions. These purchases and a subsequent cancellation of some expansionary U.K. budgetary measures resulted in a retracement of much of the earlier increase in gilt yields. announced Elevated volatility in international financial markets con- tributed to volatility in U.S. core fixed-income markets. In markets for U.S. Treasury securities, some measures of market-implied volatility approached pandemic-era levels. Spreads of yields on agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) over yields on Treasury securities wid- ened sharply, reflecting the sensitivity of these spreads to increased volatility. The increased volatility appeared to contribute to a decline in measures of market liquidity in core fixed-income markets, in particular around the period associated with U.K. volatility, but market func- tioning remained orderly. The foreign exchange value of the dollar appreciated fur- ther over the period. Market participants perceived sev- eral Asian economies as engaging in foreign exchange market interventions in response to rapid depreciations of local currencies. In the case of advanced economies, whose monetary policy tightening was well under way, market participants focused on communications per- ceived as signaling a potentially slower pace of policy rate increases in the period ahead. reverse the overnight The manager pro tem turned next to developments in money markets and Federal Reserve operations. Usage of repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility remained fairly steady other than dur- ing the period surrounding quarter-end. In the period ahead, the relative pace of decline in ON RRP facility balances and reserve balances would depend importantly on shifts in money market conditions. Recent develop- ments, including with regard to the relationship between ON RRP facility balances and money market rates, sug- gested that, over time, conditions could evolve in a man- ner that would lead to falling usage of the ON RRP fa- cility. However, the manager pro tem noted that money market conditions could change somewhat more quickly in the lead-up to year-end because of normal factors, such as a Treasury tax payment date in December that could increase the Treasury General Account balance, and year-end position adjustments. This prospect could require money market participants to be more respon- sive to shifting liquidity conditions and to plan ahead for the coming period. Current market quotes suggested ex- pectations of limited upward pressure on domestic money market rates around year-end. In offshore dollar funding markets, the premium associated with borrow- ing dollars was modestly higher than at similar points in previous years. Regarding Federal Reserve net income, 11 Reserve Banks reported deferred assets totaling $6.3 billion in the latest H.4.1 statistical release, reflect- ing the negative net income stemming from rising inter- est expense. Many other central banks also faced nega- tive net income. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Novem- ber 1–2 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had increased at a moderate pace in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022Page 3 the year. Labor market conditions remained quite tight, and consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained ele- vated. In September, total nonfarm payroll employment posted a solid gain that was somewhat slower than the pace seen in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage point to 3.5 percent. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined in September but was more than 2 percentage points above the national average; the unemployment rate for Hispanics declined to a level that was 0.3 percentage point above the na- tional measure. The labor force participation rate edged down in September, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, moved lower, on net, from July to Septem- ber but remained high. Nominal wage growth continued to be rapid: Average hourly earnings rose 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while the em- ployment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector, which also includes benefit costs, rose 5.2 percent over this period. However, the three-month change in the ECI in September was noticeably lower than the average pace seen over the first half of the year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.2 percent over the 12 months end- ing in September, and core PCE inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.1 percent over the same pe- riod. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.7 percent in September. The staff’s common inflation expectations index, which combines information from many indicators of inflation expecta- tions and inflation compensation, was little changed in the third quarter but remained above pre-pandemic lev- els. Real PCE rose modestly in the third quarter. Residential investment dropped further, however, and business fixed investment growth was held back by a decline in nonresidential structures investment. Government pur- chases rose in the third quarter after having declined over the first half of the year. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in the third quarter. Net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth, as real exports stepped up while real imports declined. Data pointed to weakening foreign economic activity in recent months, weighed down by the economic fallout of Russia’s war against Ukraine, headwinds in China, and tighter financial conditions. In many advanced foreign economies, high inflation and disruptions to energy sup- ply contributed to a decline in real disposable incomes and depressed consumer and business confidence. In response, fiscal authorities in Europe and Japan an- nounced packages intended to ease the burden of high inflation on consumers and businesses. In China, data indicated weaker momentum in economic activity and a further deterioration in the property market. Weaker global demand has also resulted in a pronounced slow- down in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in ex- port-oriented emerging market economies in Asia. Con- sumer price inflation rose further in October in many foreign economies, reflecting past increases in energy and food prices, but also a continued broadening of in- flationary pressure within core prices. In response to high inflation, many central banks further tightened monetary policy, albeit at a slower pace in some cases. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved sub- stantially higher. Broad domestic equity prices were little changed, on net, amid high market volatility, while cor- porate bond yields increased notably. The rise in bor- rowing costs appeared to have slowed the volume of fi- nancing in many credit markets. Credit quality remained sound overall, although there are some signs of deterio- ration for lower-rated borrowers. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes rose notably over the intermeeting period, largely reflecting more-re- strictive-than-expected monetary policy communica- tions and data releases that pointed to inflation moving down more slowly than previously expected. On net, nominal Treasury yields increased across the maturity spectrum. The increases in nominal yields at medium- and longer-term horizons were primarily accounted for by higher real yields, though inflation compensation measures rose as well. Broad equity price indexes fell significantly early in the intermeeting period, with inflation news and monetary policy expectations likely being the main drivers of stock price movements. However, equity prices later re- bounded and ended the period essentially unchanged on net. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—declined slightly, on net, but re- mained at the upper end of its range since mid-2020. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the September in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve’s admin- istered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates. In secured markets, money market rates remained soft relative to the ON RRP offering rate, at- tributed to subdued Treasury bill supply, elevated de- mand for Treasury collateral, and investor demand for very short-term assets amid uncertainty over the pace of policy rate increases. Daily take-up in the ON RRP fa- cility remained elevated amid this softness in repurchase agreement rates. Money market fund net yields rose along with the rise in administered rates, while retail bank deposit rates increased modestly on balance. Foreign asset prices were volatile over the intermeeting period as investors grappled with the combination of a deteriorating global growth outlook and synchronous policy tightening undertaken by major central banks in response to high inflation. Fiscal and political develop- ments in the United Kingdom added to market volatility but left little net imprint. On balance, sovereign bond yields in most advanced foreign economies rose mod- estly and equity prices were mixed. The U.S. dollar ap- preciated against most major currencies, driven by wid- ening yield differentials between the United States and the rest of the world and further deterioration of the for- eign growth outlook. The Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, on net, even though Japanese author- ities intervened to support the yen. The Chinese renminbi depreciated significantly against the dollar as continuation of the zero-COVID policy and increased investor concerns about longer-term growth prospects weighed on the currency. Investors continued to with- draw from dedicated emerging market economy and Eu- ropean funds amid further increases in U.S. Treasury yields and concerns over foreign economic growth. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs continued to rise over the intermeeting period. Yields for corpo- rate bonds and institutional leveraged loans increased. Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued the upward trend observed since the first quarter of 2022, while a rising proportion of small businesses reported facing increased borrowing costs in September. Municipal bond yields increased across rat- ings categories. Residential mortgage rates rose further in the period following the September FOMC meeting, nearly reaching their highest levels since 2002. Interest rates on existing credit card accounts continued to trend upward, reflecting increases in the federal funds rate that were quickly passed through to prime rates. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households despite some signs of tightening lending standards in certain segments, but high borrowing costs reduced the demand for credit in many markets. Issu- ance of corporate bonds, although quite strong in early September, slowed significantly in late September and October. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance de- clined in September. Equity issuance and gross issuance of municipal bonds remained weak in September and October. Business loans at banks continued to expand in Septem- ber but at a slower pace than observed in past months. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported hav- ing tightened C&I and commercial real estate (CRE) lending standards over the previous three months. Meanwhile, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also slowed amid higher spreads. Credit appeared to remain generally available to most small businesses, though the share of small firms report- ing that it was more difficult to obtain loans than three months ago continued its upward trend in September. Credit remained available in the residential mortgage market for borrowers who are able to pay high interest rates. The number of home-purchase and refinance mortgage originations were about flat in August and September but down significantly from late last year. Consumer credit remained available for most borrowers in July and August, with auto credit and credit card credit growing at a robust pace. However, banks in the Octo- ber SLOOS reported being less likely to approve auto and credit card loans to subprime and near-prime bor- rowers compared with earlier this year. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed signs of deterioration in some sectors but remained gen- erally solid overall. The volume of corporate bond rat- ing upgrades was roughly on par with that of down- grades in September. However, upgrades were concen- trated in the investment-grade segment; in the specula- tive-grade segment, downgrades outpaced upgrades, and market-implied expectations of defaults over the next year increased markedly. Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans rose slightly from low levels. The credit quality of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ bal- ance sheets also remained sound. Delinquency rates for CRE loans in non-agency CMBS pools ticked up in Sep- tember, as did indicators of future payment stress. De- linquency rates on small business loans remained quite low, and the credit quality of municipal securities re- mained strong. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022Page 5 The credit quality of most households also appeared to remain solid. Delinquencies on residential mortgage loans continued to trend down, and the share of mort- gages in foreclosure in August remained close to pre- pandemic levels. Available data through the second quarter indicated that credit card and auto credit delin- quency rates continued to rise; however, delinquencies for auto loans were near their pre-pandemic levels, and those for credit cards remained well below pre-pandemic levels. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff noted that re- spondents to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey of near-term risks judged that economic, finan- cial, and geopolitical risks had risen across the globe. Amid this weaker outlook and higher interest rates, prices of risky assets generally fell, though real estate val- uations remained elevated. Household borrowing was moderate, and mortgage performance remained strong. Nonfinancial businesses’ leverage continued to decline, and interest coverage ratios continued to increase; how- ever, further increases in borrowing costs could pose risks to some borrowers’ ability to service their debts. In the financial sector, the results of this year’s stress test demonstrated that large banks remain resilient to a sub- stantial economic downturn, but there were indicators of elevated leverage at hedge funds and other nonbank financial institutions. Short-term funding markets con- tinued to have structural vulnerabilities. Funding risks at domestic banks remained low, but prime money mar- ket funds, other cash-investment vehicles, open-end mu- tual funds, and stablecoins all continued to be suscepti- ble to disruptive redemptions. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting was weaker than the September forecast. Broad financial conditions were expected to be considerably more restrictive over the projection period than in September, reflecting both recent market moves and upward revisions to the staff’s assumptions regarding the future course of monetary policy based on recent Federal Reserve communications. As a result, output was expected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential early in 2024 and to remain below potential in 2025. Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to be above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate in 2024 and 2025. On a 12-month change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.3 percent in 2022 and core inflation was expected to be 4.6 percent. The staff raised their projection for core PCE price inflation in coming quar- ters, reflecting their assessment that the factors that had boosted inflation since the middle of last year—most notably, strong wage growth and the effect of supply constraints on prices—would persist for longer than previously thought. With the effects of supply–demand imbalances in goods markets expected to unwind and la- bor and product markets expected to become less tight, the staff continued to project that inflation would de- cline markedly over the next two years; in 2025, both to- tal and core PCE price inflation were expected to be 2 percent. With inflation remaining stubbornly high, the staff con- tinued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the upside. For real activity, sluggish growth in real private domestic spending, a deteriorating global outlook, and tightening financial conditions were all seen as salient downside risks to the projection for real activ- ity; in addition, the possibility that a persistent reduction in inflation could require a greater-than-assumed amount of tightening in financial conditions was seen as another downside risk. The staff, therefore, continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and viewed the possibility that the economy would enter a recession sometime over the next year as almost as likely as the baseline. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained el- evated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on in- flation and were weighing on global economic activity. Against this background, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks. With regard to current economic activity and the near- term outlook, participants observed that although real GDP rebounded in the third quarter, recent data sug- gested that economic activity in the near term appeared likely to expand at a pace below its trend growth rate. Participants noted a softening in consumer and business spending growth, and some participants remarked that Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ there had been a notable slowing in interest rate-sensi- tive sectors, particularly housing, in response to the tightening of financial conditions associated with the Committee’s policy actions. With inflation remaining far too high and showing few signs of moderating, partici- pants observed that a period of below-trend real GDP growth would be helpful in bringing aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance, reducing in- flationary pressures, and setting the stage for the sus- tained achievement of the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that growth in consumer spending had softened recently. Several participants remarked that there had been a reduction in discretionary expenditures, especially among lower- and middle-income households, whose purchases were shifting toward lower-cost options. Par- ticipants observed that, in aggregate, household-sector balance sheets were still strong and that this factor would continue to support consumer spending. A few partici- pants noted that some households had been running down the additional savings they had accumulated dur- ing the pandemic and that there were reports of a rise in the number of households experiencing financial strains. Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had notably restrained housing activity. With regard to the business sector, participants noted that growth in investment spending was modest. Several participants observed that business investment was be- ing weighed down by tighter financial conditions, al- though a few participants reported that some business contacts indicated that their investment spending had been resilient. Some participants mentioned reports re- ceived from business contacts of easing supply bottle- necks, reflected in declines in shipping costs and delivery times, although the reported extent of these improve- ments varied across contacts. A few participants re- marked that, in instances in which supply constraints had eased, their business contacts found it easier to plan production or had diminished needs to maintain precau- tionary inventories. A couple of participants noted that drought conditions in the Midwest were making some waterways, notably the Mississippi River System, less navigable. These conditions were creating new supply constraints and putting upward pressures on transporta- tion costs and prices for farm products. Participants observed that, with inflation elevated glob- ally, many central banks were tightening monetary policy simultaneously, contributing to an overall tightening of global financial conditions. Participants further noted that the overall tightening of global financial conditions, along with energy prices and other headwinds, was con- tributing to a slowdown in the growth rate of global real GDP. Participants remarked that the foreign economic slowdown, in combination with a strong U.S. dollar, was likely to weigh on the U.S. export sector, and several par- ticipants commented that there could be wider spillovers to the U.S. economy. Participants observed that the labor market had re- mained very tight, with the unemployment rate near a historically low level, the number of job vacancies very high, a low pace of layoffs, robust employment gains, and elevated nominal wage growth. Some participants remarked that employers in certain sectors, such as health care, leisure and hospitality, or construction, faced particularly acute labor shortages and that these short- ages were contributing to especially strong wage pres- sures in those sectors. Participants commented on the labor market having remained strong to date, even alongside the slowing in economic activity. A number of participants remarked that some businesses were keen to retain workers after their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. These participants noted that this consideration had limited layoffs even as the broader economy had softened or that this behavior could limit layoffs if aggregate economic activity were to soften further. Nevertheless, many participants noted tentative signs that the labor market might be moving slowly toward a better balance of supply and demand; these signs included a lower rate of job turnover and a moderation in nominal wage growth. Participants antic- ipated that imbalances in the labor market would gradu- ally diminish and that the unemployment rate would likely rise somewhat from its current very low level, while vacancies would likely fall. Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and was well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Some participants noted that the burden of high inflation was falling disproportionally on low-in- come households, for whom necessities like food, en- ergy, and shelter make up a larger share of expenditures. Many participants observed that price pressures had in- creased in the services sector and that, historically, price pressures in this sector had been more persistent than those in the goods sector. Some participants noted that the recent high pace of nominal wage growth, taken to- gether with the recent low pace of productivity growth, would, if sustained, be inconsistent with achievement of the 2 percent inflation objective. Several participants, however, commented on signs of a moderation in nom- _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022Page 7 inal wage growth. Participants agreed that near-term in- flation pressures were high, but some noted that lower commodity prices or the expected reduced pressure on goods prices due to an easing of supply constraints should contribute to lower inflation in the medium term. Several participants remarked that rent increases on new leases had been slowing in recent months, but partici- pants also noted that it would take some time for this development to show up in PCE inflation. Several par- ticipants summarized reports provided by business con- tacts about their firms’ ability to pass on higher input costs to their customers. These reports suggested that some firms continued to have solid pricing power, while in other cases cost pass-through had become more dif- ficult. Participants remarked that, overall, measures of me- dium- and longer-term inflation expectations obtained from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial markets quotes appeared to have re- mained well anchored. A couple of participants ob- served that longer-term inflation expectations were sta- ble even as measures of near-term inflation expectations responded to realized inflation in line with historical pat- terns. Participants noted that longer-term inflation ex- pectations were an important influence on inflation’s be- havior and stressed that the Committee’s ongoing mon- etary policy tightening would be essential for ensuring that these expectations remained well anchored. Several participants expressed the concern that the longer infla- tion remained well above the 2 percent goal, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could be- come unanchored. Such a development, if it material- ized, would make it much more costly to bring inflation down and to achieve the Committee’s statutory objec- tives of maximum employment and price stability. A couple of participants discussed the high dispersion of longer-term inflation expectations across respondents in various surveys: These participants noted that the higher dispersion may signal increased uncertainty about the in- flation outlook and was a reason not to be complacent about longer-term inflation expectations remaining well anchored. Participants discussed the length of the lags in the re- sponse of the economy to monetary policy actions, tak- ing into account historical experience and the various es- timates of timing relationships provided in economic re- search, as well as the high degree of uncertainty involved in applying the evidence on lags to the current situation. They noted that monetary policy tightening typically produced rapid effects on financial conditions but that the full effects of changes in financial conditions on ag- gregate spending and the labor market, and then on in- flation, likely took longer to materialize. With regard to current circumstances, many participants remarked that, even though the tightening of monetary policy had clearly influenced financial conditions and had had no- table effects in some interest rate-sensitive sectors, the timing of the effects on overall economic activity, the labor market, and inflation was still quite uncertain, with the full extent of the effects yet to be realized. Several participants observed that, because of the difficulties in isolating the effects of monetary policy, changes in eco- nomic structure, or increasing transparency over time re- garding monetary policy decisions, the historical record did not provide definitive evidence on the length of these lags. In addition, some participants noted that the post-pandemic dynamics of the economy may differ from those prevailing prior to the pandemic. Participants generally noted that the uncertainty associ- ated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the up- side. Participants observed that recent inflation had been higher and more persistent than anticipated. Some participants noted the risk that energy prices could rise sharply again amid geopolitical tensions. A few partici- pants commented that the ongoing tightness in the labor market could lead to an emergence of a wage–price spi- ral, even though one had not yet developed. A number of participants judged that the risks regarding the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside, with various global headwinds being promi- nently cited. These global headwinds included a slow- down in economic activity occurring in China and the ongoing international economic implications of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Participants observed that, because of high inflation pressures prevailing globally, monetary policy tightening was under way in many other econo- mies—a development likely to affect foreign economic activity and carrying the potential for spillovers to the U.S. economy. In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities for the trans- mission of monetary policy, for meeting the financing needs of the federal government, and for the operation of the global financial system. Participants observed that, despite elevated interest rate volatility and indica- tions of strained liquidity conditions, the functioning of the Treasury securities market had been orderly. Noting that the value of resilience of the market for Treasury Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ securities was underlined by recent gilt market disrup- tions in the United Kingdom, a number of participants discussed a range of issues that could be considered by the appropriate authorities regarding market resilience, including potential interactions of capital and liquidity regulations with market activity, oversight of key market participants, clearing and settlement practices, and the role and structure of the Federal Reserve’s standing fa- cilities. A few participants noted the importance of be- ing prepared to address disruptions in U.S. core market functioning in ways that would not affect the stance of monetary policy, especially during episodes of monetary policy tightening. Several participants noted the risks posed by nonbank financial institutions amid the rapid global tightening of monetary policy and the potential for hidden leverage in these institutions to amplify shocks. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that infla- tion remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and the recent data on inflation pro- vided very few signs that inflation pressures were abat- ing. The economic expansion had slowed significantly from last year’s rapid pace, and recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production in the cur- rent quarter. Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remained extremely tight, and nominal wage growth remained elevated. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. Partici- pants observed that the policy rate hike at this meeting was another step toward making the Committee’s mon- etary policy stance sufficiently restrictive to help ease supply and demand imbalances and to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In their discussion of the effects of monetary policy ac- tions and communications to date, participants con- curred that the Committee had taken forceful steps to moderate aggregate demand in order to bring it into bet- ter alignment with aggregate supply. Financial condi- tions had tightened significantly in response to the Com- mittee’s policy actions, and their effects were clearly ev- ident in the most interest rate-sensitive sectors of the economy, including residential investment and some components of business investment. Several partici- pants commented that monetary policy actions and communications had helped keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored—a situation that would help facilitate the return of inflation to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Nevertheless, with realized inflation well above that goal and the labor market still very tight, participants agreed that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be ap- propriate and would help keep longer-term inflation ex- pectations well anchored. Participants noted that, with regard to both real economic activity and inflation, it would take time for the full effects of monetary restraint to be realized and that these lags complicated an assess- ment of the effects of monetary policy. In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meet- ings, participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objec- tive, and they continued to anticipate that ongoing in- creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate in order to attain a sufficiently re- strictive stance of policy to bring inflation down over time. Many participants commented that there was sig- nificant uncertainty about the ultimate level of the fed- eral funds rate needed to achieve the Committee’s goals and that their assessment of that level would depend, in part, on incoming data. Even so, various participants noted that, with inflation showing little sign thus far of abating, and with supply and demand imbalances in the economy persisting, their assessment of the ultimate level of the federal funds rate that would be necessary to achieve the Committee’s goals was somewhat higher than they had previously expected. Participants mentioned a number of considerations that would likely influence the pace of future increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. These consider- ations included the cumulative tightening of monetary policy to date, the lags between monetary policy actions and the behavior of economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. A number of participants observed that, as monetary policy ap- proached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve the Committee’s goals, it would become appro- priate to slow the pace of increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. In addition, a substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of in- crease would likely soon be appropriate. A slower pace in these circumstances would better allow the Commit- tee to assess progress toward its goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary pol- icy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assess- ment was important. A few participants commented _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 1–2, 2022Page 9 that slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system. A few other partic- ipants noted that, before slowing the pace of policy rate increases, it could be advantageous to wait until the stance of policy was more clearly in restrictive territory and there were more concrete signs that inflation pres- sures were receding significantly. With monetary policy approaching a sufficiently restric- tive stance, participants emphasized that the level to which the Committee ultimately raised the target range for the federal funds rate, and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter, had become more important consider- ations for achieving the Committee’s goals than the pace of further increases in the target range. Participants agreed that communicating this distinction to the public was important in order to reinforce the Committee’s strong commitment to returning inflation to the 2 per- cent objective. Participants discussed a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol- icy. In light of the continuing broad-based and unac- ceptably high level of inflation and upside risks to the inflation outlook, participants remarked that purpose- fully moving to a more restrictive policy stance was con- sistent with risk-management considerations. Some par- ticipants observed that there had been an increase in the risk that the cumulative policy restraint would exceed what was required to bring inflation back to 2 percent. Several participants commented that continued rapid policy tightening increased the risk of instability or dis- locations in the financial system. There was wide agree- ment that heightened uncertainty regarding the outlooks for both inflation and real activity underscored the im- portance of taking into account the cumulative tighten- ing of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation, and eco- nomic and financial developments. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators had pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation had remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members observed that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Members concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3¾ to 4 percent. Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropri- ate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy suffi- ciently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Members agreed to add language to this effect in the postmeeting statement, on the grounds that this would underscore the Committee’s view that a suffi- ciently restrictive stance of monetary policy was needed for achieving its dual-mandate goals. Members agreed that, in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affected economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. Members agreed to add language to this effect in the postmeeting statement in order to convey explicitly the range of fac- tors that they would consider in determining future monetary policy actions. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. All members affirmed that they were strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objec- tive. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and financial and inter- national developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ “Effective November 3, 2022, Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: the Federal • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 3¾ to 4 percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion; the aggregate opera- tion limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 3.8 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month.

Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional up- ward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3¾ to 4 percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing in- creases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Com- mittee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in May. The Com- mittee is strongly committed to returning infla- tion to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a discussion of de- velopments in financial markets. Following several months of tightening, financial conditions eased over the period as investor concerns about global risks edged lower and incoming data showed nascent signs of a moderation in inflationary pressures. Central bank com- munications signaling a slower pace of policy rate in- creases appeared to contribute to improved sentiment. Measures of implied volatility across financial markets declined somewhat from the elevated levels observed in October. Consistent with the decline in volatility, model-based measures suggested that a drop in term premiums accounted for much of the decline in Treasury yields over the period. Equity markets moved higher. However, equity market contacts noted risks to growth ahead, and earnings expectations for coming quarters had been marked down. In foreign exchange markets, moderating concerns about the potential for highly ele- vated U.S. interest rates spurred a depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. In other market developments, the manager pro tem noted the failure of a prominent crypto-asset exchange. While the spillovers from this situation had been significant among other crypto lenders and exchanges, the collapse was not seen as posing broader market risks to the financial system. Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation Protected Securities declined over the period, respond- ing to lower-than-expected consumer price index (CPI) data and a sizable drop in oil prices. However, the Desk survey-based measures of inflation expectations were lit- tle changed from the prior survey, suggesting that falling inflation risk premiums may have contributed to the moves. Both market- and survey-based measures con- tinued to point to expectations for a moderation of in- flation over the coming year. Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, both mar- ket- and Desk survey-based measures indicated expecta- tions for the Committee to maintain elevated policy rates through 2023. In the December survey, the median re- spondent’s modal expectation for the path of the federal funds rate in 2023 shifted higher by 25 basis points rela- tive to the November survey. The survey-based estimate of the expected policy path in 2024 continued to suggest a decline in the target range for the federal funds rate over 2024, little changed from the path anticipated in the November survey. In contrast, the market-implied path of the federal funds rate in 2024 shifted down by as much as ¾ percentage point over the period, likely re- flecting declining risk premiums. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of op- erations and money markets and assessed that balance sheet runoff was proceeding smoothly. Repurchase agreement (repo) rates firmed modestly relative to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) fa- cility rate over the period with balance sheet reduction reportedly contributing, in part, to an increase in the de- mand for financing of Treasury securities. ON RRP bal- ances declined, on net, as money market funds shifted investments out of the ON RRP facility, reportedly in favor of higher rates available in repo markets. In recent months, banks continued to increase their use of wholesale funding. In addition, survey information suggested that banks expected to move deposit rates modestly higher relative to the target range in coming months. Over time, greater competition among banks for funding could contribute to drawdowns in the ON RRP facility. Staff indicated that they would con- tinue to monitor money market conditions closely as bal- ance sheet reduction proceeds. Looking ahead to year end, market participants antici- pated limited pressures. The manager pro tem noted that if transitory pressures emerged in money markets, the Federal Reserve’s backstop facilities are available to support effective policy implementation and smooth market functioning. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the Decem- ber 13–14 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domes- tic product (GDP) was increasing at a modest pace in the fourth quarter of 2022 after expanding strongly in the third quarter. Labor market conditions eased some- what over October and November but remained quite tight. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—stepped down in October but continued to be elevated. Total nonfarm payroll employment posted solid gains in October and November that were slower than the aver- age monthly pace seen over the earlier part of the year. The unemployment rate moved up 0.2 percentage point to 3.7 percent in October and remained at that rate in November. On balance, the unemployment rate for Af- rican Americans edged down over those two months, while the unemployment rate for Hispanics increased slightly; the unemployment rates for both groups re- mained above the national measure. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio declined a little over the past two months. The private-sector job openings rate, as meas- ured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved back down in October but remained high. Nominal wage growth continued to be elevated and re- mained above the pace judged to be consistent with the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective. Average hourly earnings rose 5.1 percent over the 12 months ending in November, close to the pace recorded in the employ- ment cost index of hourly compensation in the private sector over the 12 months ending in September. Com- pensation per hour (CPH) in the business sector rose 4.0 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, but the reported increase likely understated the true pace of increase in CPH, as the lower second-quar- ter employment data from the Quarterly Census of Em- ployment and Wages had not yet been incorporated in the CPH measure. Consumer price inflation remained elevated but had eased in recent months. Total PCE price inflation was 6.0 percent over the 12 months ending in October, 0.3 percentage point below the September figure. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in con- sumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in October, down 0.2 percentage point from its September reading. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las remained at 4.7 percent in October. In November, the 12-month change in the CPI stepped down to 7.1 percent and core CPI inflation dropped to 6.0 per- cent. The CPI, along with data from the producer price index, pointed to a further slowing in PCE price inflation in November. A preliminary estimate of the staff’s com- mon inflation expectations index, which combines infor- mation from many indicators of inflation expectations and inflation compensation, edged down in the fourth quarter but continued to be above pre-pandemic levels. After expanding at a moderate pace in the third quarter, real PCE growth appeared to have picked up in the fourth quarter. In contrast, residential investment looked to be contracting sharply further, and growth in business fixed investment seemed to be slowing mark- edly, with tepid gains in equipment and intangibles spending and continued declines in nonresidential struc- tures investment. Manufacturing production increased only modestly in October, and the available data pointed to a decline in November. A decrease in factory output would be consistent with recent readings from national and regional manufacturing surveys, which showed de- clining new orders and a drawdown in order backlogs. After narrowing in the third quarter, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in October. Real goods exports fell, led by declines in exports of industrial supplies and consumer goods. Real goods imports rose, driven by increases in imports of industrial supplies, which more than offset declines in imports of capital goods and consumer goods. Exports of services rose, in part as travel exports continued to recover, while im- ports of services were little changed. Foreign economic activity grew at a moderate pace in the third quarter, but more recent data pointed to weakening growth, weighed down by the economic fallout of Rus- sia’s war against Ukraine and a COVID-19-related slow- down in China. High inflation continued to contribute to a decline in real disposable incomes, which, together with disruptions to energy supplies, depressed economic activity, especially in Europe. In China, authorities be- gan to ease social restrictions even as COVID cases surged, raising the prospect of significant disruptions to economic activity in the near term, but also a faster reo- pening. Weaker global demand and high interest rates also weighed on activity in emerging market economies. Despite tentative signs of easing in foreign headline in- flation, core inflationary pressures remained elevated in Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ many countries. In response to high inflation, many cen- tral banks further tightened monetary policy, albeit at a slower pace in some cases. period, mostly passing through the increase in adminis- tered rates, while bank deposit rates increased only slightly in October and November. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, Treasury yields and measures of inflation compensation declined, on net, and the implied path of the federal funds rate in 2023 ended modestly lower. Stock market indexes rose, on balance, likely reflecting reduced concerns about the in- flation outlook, and market volatility declined notably. Borrowing costs declined, on net, over the intermeeting period. Credit flows moderated a bit in recent months, and the credit quality of businesses and most households remained solid. The expected path of the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of financial market quotes ended the inter- meeting period lower, largely reflecting data releases that pointed to a larger-than-expected moderation in infla- tion. Medium-to-longer-term nominal Treasury yields declined substantially over the intermeeting period, driven primarily by lower-than-expected inflation data releases, which appeared to prompt a substantial reduc- tion in investors’ concerns about the possibility that in- flation would remain high for a long period. In line with those developments, inflation compensation measures based on inflation swaps declined notably, especially for shorter maturities. Broad stock price indexes increased, likely reflecting re- duced concerns about the inflation outlook and the as- sociated implications for the future path of policy. On net, the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—decreased notably and was around the middle of its range since mid-2020. In line with re- duced investor concerns about the inflation outlook, spreads of interest rates on corporate debt, mortgage- backed securities, and municipal bonds to comparable- duration Treasury yields all narrowed over the intermeet- ing period. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the November in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve’s admin- istered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates. In secured markets, repo rates were below the ON RRP offering rate less frequently than in the pre- vious intermeeting period. Daily take-up in the ON RRP facility declined modestly, consistent with the recent firming in overnight repo rates. Net yields on money market funds rose further over the intermeeting Foreign financial conditions broadly eased over the in- termeeting period, largely driven by lower-than-expected U.S. inflation data. The foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciated against most foreign currencies, par- ticularly against those of advanced foreign economies, in part reflecting a narrowing of near-term yield differen- tials between the United States and other advanced economies. Investors reacted positively to news of an easing of COVID restrictions in China, which drove risky asset prices significantly higher despite near-term challenges associated with the health policy shift. Emerging market fund outflows moderated and turned to inflows later in the intermeeting period. Option- implied volatility measures for exchange rates and benchmark foreign yields declined but remained ele- vated by historical norms amid a high degree of uncer- tainty around global inflation and the prospects for a re- opening of the Chinese economy. In domestic credit markets, changes in borrowing costs were mixed during the intermeeting period but remained above levels observed at the end of the previous tight- ening cycle. Yields for corporate bonds declined, while borrowing costs for leveraged loans remained at an ele- vated level. Bank interest rates for commercial and in- dustrial (C&I) loans continued to trend up in the third quarter. Municipal bond yields also decreased across rat- ing categories. Residential mortgage rates fell, on net, after the November FOMC meeting. In contrast, inter- est rates in credit card offers continued to increase, re- flecting the higher prime rate that was quickly passed through. Interest rates on auto loans also rose steadily through November. Credit continued to be generally available to businesses and households, but high borrowing costs appeared to weigh on financing volumes in many markets. Issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds rebounded some- what in late October and November from earlier sub- dued levels, while speculative-grade issuance remained soft. New launches of leveraged loans picked up in No- vember, particularly for higher-rated firms. Business loan originations continued to expand in Octo- ber and November but at a slower pace than observed in previous months. C&I loans continued to grow in October and November but decelerated relative to the third-quarter pace, moderating the robust rate of growth observed earlier this year. Nonetheless, the volume of Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ C&I lending remained solid overall. Commercial real es- tate (CRE) loans outstanding at commercial banks con- tinued to increase in October and November, but the recent pace was somewhat lower than in previous months. In addition, banks increased CRE originations to multifamily and industrial properties relative to office properties, reflecting caution in the context of rising of- fice vacancies. Moreover, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issuance softened somewhat in Octo- ber amid elevated financing costs and tighter underwrit- ing standards. Credit availability to small businesses ap- peared to have tightened further this fall, with the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to ob- tain credit than three months earlier trending up through November. Credit was readily available in the residential mortgage market for high-credit-score borrowers who met stand- ard conforming loan criteria. Credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter at levels comparable with what prevailed before the pandemic. The number of home purchases and re- finance mortgage rate locks edged lower at subdued lev- els despite recent declines in mortgage interest rates. In contrast, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) grew notably in recent months, on net, potentially reflecting homeowners using HELOCs as a preferred way of ex- tracting home equity in the presence of high mortgage rates. Consumer credit remained available for most con- sumers through September, with auto loans and credit card debt growing at a robust pace. Bank credit data also indicate that the expansion in credit card balances con- tinued in October before slowing in early November. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid. The volume of speculative-grade corporate bond downgrades slightly exceeded upgrades in October and investment-grade corporate November, while for bonds, the volume of upgrades turned positive, on net, in November. Leveraged loans experienced net down- grades in October, but the pace of net downgrades slowed substantially in recent weeks. Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained at very low levels. However, measures of expected default probabilities for corporate bonds and leveraged loans had increased from their levels at the beginning of the year in recent months. Overall, the credit quality of mu- nicipalities remained robust amid strong revenues at state and local governments. The credit quality of busi- nesses that borrow from banks remained sound on bal- ance. Delinquencies on C&I loans stayed flat, and those on small businesses loans continued to edge up, but de- linquencies remained low relative to historical levels. In addition, the credit quality of non-agency CMBS loan borrowers deteriorated slightly, with average delin- quency rates ticking up in September and October, driven by the office and retail sectors. The credit quality of most households remained solid overall. Delinquencies on conventional mortgages con- tinued to trend down through October, while those on Federal Housing Administration mortgages ticked up a bit from low levels. In contrast, delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise over the third quarter. While delinquency rates on credit cards remained low relative to their historical range, those on auto loans surpassed their pre-pandemic peak. Staff Economic Outlook The forecast for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting was not as weak as the November projection. Recent data suggested that real GDP growth in the second half of 2022 was stronger than previously expected, but economic growth was still forecast to slow markedly in 2023 from its sec- ond-half pace. Broad financial conditions were pro- jected to be somewhat less restrictive than previously as- sumed, as the effects of a higher path for equity values and a lower path for the dollar more than offset a higher medium-term trajectory for interest rates. Nevertheless, the forecast for U.S. real GDP growth through 2025 re- mained subdued. The staff slightly lowered its outlook for potential output, reflecting a lower expected trend in labor force participation. Moreover, the staff assumed a slower pace of decline in the natural rate of unemploy- ment over the near term in response to recent estimates suggesting that job-matching efficiency was not improv- ing as fast as previously anticipated. With all these changes, output was expected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential near the end of 2024—a year later than in the previous forecast—and to remain below po- tential in 2025. Likewise, the unemployment rate was expected to move above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate near the end of 2024 and remain above it in 2025. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.5 percent in 2022, while core infla- tion was expected to be 4.7 percent, both lower than in the November projection. With the effects of supply– demand imbalances in goods markets expected to un- wind further and labor and product markets projected to become less tight, the staff continued to forecast that in- flation would decline markedly over the next two years. Core goods inflation was anticipated to slow further, housing services inflation was expected to peak in 2023 and then move down, while core non-housing services Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation was forecast to move down as wage growth eased. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent. With inflation still elevated, the staff continued to view the risks to the inflation projection as skewed to the up- side. Moreover, the sluggish growth in real private do- mestic spending expected over the next year, a subdued global economic outlook, and persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activ- ity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime over the next year as a plausible alternative to the baseline. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2022 through 2025 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth of spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained el- evated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events were contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Against this background, participants continued to be highly at- tentive to inflation risks. Participants observed that the growth of economic ac- tivity had slowed significantly in 2022 from the previous year’s robust pace, partly in response to the Committee’s policy actions. The effects of those actions were espe- cially notable in interest-sensitive sectors, particularly housing. Participants remarked that, although real GDP appeared to have rebounded moderately in the second half of 2022 after declining somewhat in the first half, economic activity appeared likely to expand in 2023 at a pace well below its trend growth rate. With inflation re- maining unacceptably high, participants expected that a sustained period of below-trend real GDP growth would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate de- mand into better balance and thereby reduce inflationary pressures. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that growth in consumer spending in September and October had been stronger than they had previously expected, likely supported by a strong labor market and households running down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. A couple of participants remarked that excess savings likely would continue to support con- sumption spending for a while. A couple of other par- ticipants, however, commented that excess savings, par- ticularly among low-income households, appeared to be lower and declining more rapidly than previously thought or that the savings, the majority of which ap- peared to be held by higher-income households, might continue to be largely unspent. Several participants re- marked that budgets were stretched for low-to-moder- ate-income households and that many consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives. They also observed that many households were increas- ingly using credit to finance spending. Overall, partici- pants assessed that there was considerable uncertainty around the consumer spending outlook. Participants commented that higher mortgage interest rates had no- tably restrained housing activity and that they expected housing activity to remain weak. A couple of partici- pants remarked on anecdotes or concerns from builder contacts about contract cancellations by purchasers no longer able to qualify for loans at higher interest rates. With regard to the business sector, participants noted that growth in investment spending appeared modest and was being restrained by high borrowing costs and an outlook for slow growth of final demand, although views on investment prospects varied across businesses and Districts. Based on discussions with District con- tacts as well as a survey of firms’ chief financial officers, some participants commented that while businesses were generally optimistic about their own prospects, they expressed increasing concern about the general eco- nomic outlook for 2023. Participants noted signs of continued easing in supply bottlenecks, with a couple cit- ing District contacts’ reports of declines in shipping costs and delivery times. Even so, participants remarked that the improvements in supply chains had not been uniform and supply shortages remained for some types of goods. Participants also discussed the developments Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in energy and agricultural sectors. Several participants commented that they saw diminished risks of severe dis- ruption from the European Union’s embargo and the Group of Seven’s price cap on Russian oil exports. A couple of participants noted that high costs for inputs like diesel, feed, and fertilizer were creating challenges for the agricultural sector. Participants observed that the labor market had re- mained very tight, with the unemployment rate near a historically low level, robust payroll gains, a high level of job vacancies, and elevated nominal wage growth. Sev- eral participants commented that there were tentative signs of labor market imbalances improving, including declines in job openings and quits over the second half of 2022 as well as reports from District contacts that they were seeing more qualified job applicants for open positions than earlier in the year. Some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust even as they slowed in recent months. Nevertheless, they noted that some other measures of employment—such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ house- hold survey and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages—suggested that job growth in 2022 may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment. Participants generally concluded that there remained a large imbalance between labor supply and labor demand, as indicated by the still-large number of job openings and elevated nominal wage growth. Participants com- mented that labor demand had remained strong to date despite the slowdown in economic growth, with a few remarking that some business contacts reported that they would be keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing demand for output because of their recent ex- periences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. With the labor force participation rate little changed since the beginning of 2022, some participants commented that labor supply appeared to be constrained by structural factors such as early retirements, reduced availability or increased cost of childcare, more costly transportation, and reduced immigration. Under an appropriately re- strictive path of monetary policy, participants expected labor market supply and demand to come into better bal- ance over time, easing upward pressures on nominal wages and prices. In the context of achieving the Com- mittee’s broad-based and inclusive maximum-employ- ment goal, a number of participants commented that as the labor market moved into better balance, the unem- ployment rate for some demographic groups—particu- larly African Americans and Hispanics—would likely in- crease by more than the national average. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. Participants concurred that the inflation data received for October and November showed welcome reductions in the monthly pace of price increases, but they stressed that it would take sub- stantially more evidence of progress to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path. Partici- pants noted that core goods prices declined in the Octo- ber and November CPI data, consistent with easing sup- ply bottlenecks. Some participants also noted that, by some measures, firms’ markups were still elevated and that a continued subdued expansion in aggregate de- mand would likely be needed to reduce remaining up- ward pressure on inflation. Regarding housing services inflation, many participants observed that measures of rent based on new leases were indicating a deceleration, which would be reflected in the measures of shelter in- flation with some lag. Participants noted that, in the lat- est inflation data, the pace of increase for prices of core services excluding shelter—which represents the largest component of core PCE price inflation—was high. They also remarked that this component of inflation has tended to be closely linked to nominal wage growth and therefore would likely remain persistently elevated if the labor market remained very tight. Consequently, while there were few signs of adverse wage-price dynamics at present, they assessed that bringing down this compo- nent of inflation to mandate-consistent levels would re- quire some softening in the growth of labor demand to bring the labor market back into better balance. Participants observed that measures from surveys of households and businesses as well as from financial mar- kets generally indicated that longer-term inflation expec- tations remained well anchored, while short-term infla- tion expectations had come down. However, partici- pants stressed that the Committee’s ongoing monetary policy tightening to achieve a stance that will be suffi- ciently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent is es- sential for ensuring that longer-term expectations re- main well anchored. Several participants commented that the longer inflation remained well above the 2 per- cent goal, the greater the risk that longer-term inflation expectations could become unanchored. Such a devel- opment, if it materialized, would make it much more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Commit- tee’s statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Participants noted that since the November meeting, fi- nancial conditions had eased, with the market-implied path for the federal funds rate beyond 2023 and longer- Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ term yields coming down noticeably. A few participants remarked that the current configuration of nominal yields, with longer-term yields lower than shorter-term yields, had historically preceded recessions and hence bore watching. However, a couple of them also noted that the current inversion of the yield curve could reflect, in part, that investors expect the nominal policy rate to decline because of a fall in inflation over time. Participants generally noted that the uncertainty associ- ated with their economic outlooks was high and that the risks to the inflation outlook remained tilted to the up- side. Participants cited the possibility that price pres- sures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated, due to, for example, the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated. Participants saw a number of uncertainties surrounding the outlook for inflation stem- ming from factors abroad, such as China’s relaxation of its zero-COVID policies, Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine, and effects of synchronous policy firm- ing by major central banks. A number of participants judged that the risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside. They noted that sources of such risks included the potential for more persistent inflation inducing more restrictive policy responses, the prospect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the economy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth, and the possibility of households’ and busi- nesses’ concerns about the outlook restraining their spending sufficiently to reduce aggregate output. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy. Even so, participants agreed that infla- tion remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, while the labor market remained very tight, contributing to upward pressures on wages and prices. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting and to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet that the Commit- tee issued in May. Participants observed that a slowing in the pace of rate increases at this meeting would better allow the Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability, as monetary policy approached a stance that was sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. With inflation staying persistently above the Commit- tee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight, all participants had raised their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate relative to their assessment at the time of the September meeting. No participants anticipated that it would be appropriate to begin reducing the federal funds rate target in 2023. Par- ticipants generally observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sus- tained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time. In view of the persistent and unaccept- ably high level of inflation, several participants com- mented that historical experience cautioned against prematurely loosening monetary policy. In light of the heightened uncertainty regarding the out- looks for both inflation and real economic activity, most participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance. Participants generally noted that the Commit- tee’s future decisions regarding policy would continue to be informed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation, and that the Committee would continue to make decisions meeting by meeting. Participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to re- turning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. A number of participants emphasized that it would be important to clearly communicate that a slowing in the pace of rate increases was not an indication of any weak- ening of the Committee’s resolve to achieve its price- stability goal or a judgment that inflation was already on a persistent downward path. Participants noted that, be- cause monetary policy worked importantly through fi- nancial markets, an unwarranted easing in financial con- ditions, especially if driven by a misperception by the public of the Committee’s reaction function, would complicate the Committee’s effort to restore price sta- bility. Several participants commented that the medians of participants’ assessments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Pro- jections, which tracked notably above market-based Minutes of the Meeting of December 13–14, 2022Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ measures of policy rate expectations, underscored the Committee’s strong commitment to returning inflation to its 2 percent goal. Participants discussed a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol- icy. Many participants highlighted that the Committee needed to continue to balance two risks. One risk was that an insufficiently restrictive monetary policy could cause inflation to remain above the Committee’s target for longer than anticipated, leading to unanchored infla- tion expectations and eroding the purchasing power of households, especially for those already facing difficulty making ends meet. The other risk was that the lagged cumulative effect of policy tightening could end up be- ing more restrictive than is necessary to bring down in- flation to 2 percent and lead to an unnecessary reduction in economic activity, potentially placing the largest bur- dens on the most vulnerable groups of the population. Participants generally indicated that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the out- look for policy. A couple of participants noted that risks to the inflation outlook were becoming more balanced. Participants generally observed that maintaining a re- strictive policy stance for a sustained period until infla- tion is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk-management perspective. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod- est growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation had remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Members observed that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. They also agreed that the war and related events were contributing to upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. Members con- curred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¼ to 4½ percent. Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be ap- propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per- cent over time. Members agreed that, in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mort- gage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Re- ducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. All members affirmed that the Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on pub- lic health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and interna- tional developments.

Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbal- ances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are contributing to upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly at- tentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¼ to 4½ percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing in- creases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Com- mittee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Bal- ance Sheet that were issued in May. The Com- mittee is strongly committed to returning infla- tion to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Susan M. Collins, Lisa D. Cook, Esther L. George, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None.
