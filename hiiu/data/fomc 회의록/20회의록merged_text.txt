The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 3 after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C.

SECURITIES LENDING 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and limitations on the iv. Subject to reasonable amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. B. The Selected Bank may: Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- i. cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i, 1.B, 1.C and 1.D shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS In order to ensure the effective conduct of open 4. market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 65 business days or less; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts.

The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur- ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com- mittee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meet- ing of the Committee. The Chairman, whenever feasi- ble, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph 5. The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision the Authorization for Foreign Currency Opera- tions and the Foreign Currency Directive as shown be- low. AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS (As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) IN GENERAL 1.

Undertaken to adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies; or iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be determined by the Committee. C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard- ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur- rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the transaction. WAREHOUSING 4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re- quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza- tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known as warehousing). RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established under the North American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand- ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro- vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com- mittee.

These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s economic and financial policies toward the objective of fostering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability. These obligations also include avoiding manipulating exchange rates or the international monetary system in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competi- tive advantage over other members. FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE (As reaffirmed effective January 28, 2020) 1. The Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to ex- ecute open market transactions, for the System Open Market Account, in accordance with the provisions of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the “Authorization”) and subject to the limits in this Di- rective. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 7 2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to exe- cute warehousing transactions, if so requested by the United States Treasury and if approved by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”), subject to the limitation that the outstanding balance of United States dollars provided to the United States Treasury as a result of these transactions not at any time exceed $5 billion. 3. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to main- tain, for the System Open Market Account: A. Reciprocal currency arrangements with the fol- lowing foreign central banks: Foreign central bank Maximum amount (millions of dollars or equivalent) Bank of Canada Bank of Mexico 2,000 3,000 Standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with B. the following foreign central banks: Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank C. Standing foreign currency liquidity swap arrange- ments with the following foreign central banks: Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank 4. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to hold and to invest foreign currencies in the portfolio in ac- cordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Au- thorization. 5. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to report to the Committee, at each regular meeting of the Com- mittee, on transactions undertaken pursuant to para- graphs 1 and 6 of the Authorization. The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com- mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur- rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori- zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con- duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera- tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. By unanimous vote, the Committee amended its Pro- gram for Security of FOMC Information (Program) with three sets of changes, effective February 1, 2020. These changes consisted of (1) an update to the rules for eligi- bility for access to FOMC information to reflect two new policies approved by the Board; (2) the addition of references to existing Federal Reserve polices that help safeguard FOMC information; and (3) organizational and technical changes to improve the consistency and accuracy of Program language. By unanimous vote, the Committee provided approval for the publication of a Federal Register notice of proposed rulemaking that seeks public comment on minor and technical updates to the FOMC Rules Regarding Avail- ability of Information, which are the Committee’s Free- dom of Information Act rules. Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices Participants continued their discussion related to the on- going review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices. At this meeting, the discussion focused on two topics: the po- tential interactions between monetary policy and finan- cial stability and the potential use of inflation ranges around the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. The staff briefing on the first topic noted that in the cur- rent environment of low neutral rates, achieving the Committee’s dual-mandate goals of maximum employ- ment and price stability would require low policy rates frequently, regardless of the monetary policy strategy and tools chosen. Consequently, policy strategies and tools that help support a stronger economy and anchor inflation expectations at a level consistent with the Com- mittee’s objective in a low-neutral-rate environment can help promote financial stability. In addition, the staff reported that the available empirical evidence suggests that the effects of changes in policy rates on asset prices and risk premiums tend to be modest relative to the his- torical fluctuations in those measures. However, there may be circumstances in which a persistently accommo- dative policy stance that is otherwise consistent with the dual-mandate goals may contribute to an increase in fi- nancial system vulnerabilities, including through in- creased borrowing, financial leverage, and valuation pressures. The staff noted that clear communications of Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the Committee’s ongoing assessments of the interac- tions between monetary policy and financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises that could otherwise contribute to financial vulnerabilities. The briefing concluded with a short review of how other cen- tral banks have approached this issue, including the use of financial instability escape clauses to provide leeway for the central bank to deviate from its usual monetary policy strategy if financial vulnerabilities become signifi- cant. In their discussion of the effects that alternative mone- tary policy strategies and tools might have on financial stability, participants noted that macroeconomic stability and the achievement of the Committee’s dual mandate depended on a stable financial system. An unstable fi- nancial system may amplify shocks to the economy and exacerbate increases in unemployment or drive inflation further away from the Committee’s goal. With respect to the relationship between monetary policy and finan- cial stability, some participants noted that evidence re- garding the link between the policy stance and elevated financial vulnerabilities was limited, with a couple of par- ticipants further observing that there were not many ep- isodes of persistently low interest rates. In addition, some past episodes of heightened financial vulnerabili- ties were associated with excessive risk-taking behavior that did not seem to be very responsive to typical changes in interest rates. A number of participants judged that, under some circumstances, low policy rates might help foster financial stability provided they are needed to support strong economic conditions and price stability. Some participants remarked, however, that keeping policy rates low to achieve both of the Commit- tee’s dual-mandate objectives may contribute to a buildup of financial vulnerabilities, especially at times when the economy is at or above full employment, a de- velopment that could pose future risks to the economy and to the ability of the Committee to achieve its dual mandate. Participants discussed how financial stability considera- tions should be incorporated in the conduct of monetary policy. They generally agreed that supervisory, regula- tory, and macroprudential tools should be the primary means to address financial stability risks. A few partici- pants commented that this is especially the case when addressing risks associated with structural features such as the current low level of neutral interest rates. A num- ber of participants noted that countercyclical macropru- dential tools, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, could be used to address cyclical financial stability risks. However, various participants noted that while these tools could be deployed proactively to lean against the buildup of financial vulnerabilities, they have some limi- tations in the context of the U.S. financial system, where the few available tools are, for the most part, not de- signed to address vulnerabilities outside the banking sec- tor. In addition, these tools are not within the authority of the Committee, and their use requires coordination with other prudential regulators. Recognizing these lim- itations, many participants remarked that the Committee should not rule out the possibility of adjusting the stance of monetary policy to mitigate financial stability risks, particularly when those risks have important implica- tions for the economic outlook and when macropruden- tial tools had been or were likely to be ineffective at mit- igating those risks. Nevertheless, many participants noted that the current knowledge of the interactions be- tween the stance of monetary policy and financial vul- nerabilities is too imprecise to warrant systematically ad- justing monetary policy in response to the evolution of financial stability risks. As a result, monetary policy should be guided primarily by the outlook for employ- ment and inflation, and it should respond to financial stability risks only insofar as such risks significantly threaten the achievement of the Committee’s mandate. Several participants observed that the monetary policy measures needed to curb financial stability risks could be quite large, and the resulting effects on employment and inflation could place a high hurdle for such measures. Some participants remarked that, because financial sta- bility risks are a consideration for achieving the Commit- tee’s dual mandate, a clear communications strategy would be needed to convey the Committee’s assess- ments of financial vulnerabilities and their potential im- plications for the monetary policy outlook. Several par- ticipants noted that a communications strategy could in- clude the possible use of financial instability escape clauses to help explain the rationale for policy actions when a buildup of financial vulnerabilities poses risks to the achievement of the Committee’s goals. The staff’s briefing on considerations regarding the use of an inflation range focused on three different concepts of an inflation range. First, an uncertainty range could communicate the magnitude of the inherent variability of inflation that would still be consistent with achieving the Committee’s symmetric inflation objective. Second, an operational range could signal that, under some condi- tions, the Committee would prefer inflation to be away from its longer-run objective for a time; such a range could potentially be used as part of a makeup policy strategy, including one based on average inflation target- ing, or in other strategies aimed at offsetting the adverse _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 9 effects of a binding effective lower bound on policy rates. Third, an indifference range could communicate that monetary policy would not respond to deviations of in- flation within that range. The briefing also summarized the experiences of foreign central banks that use infla- tion ranges; these ranges were typically put in place many years ago, often in conjunction with adopting an infla- tion target. The staff highlighted the communications challenges that could arise if an inflation range were in- troduced at a time when inflation had been running be- low the central bank’s objective for a number of years. In this environment, the introduction of a symmetric range around the point objective could be misinter- preted as a sign that the central bank was not concerned about inflation remaining below its stated goal, a situa- tion that could lead to inflation expectations drifting down to the lower end of the range. Participants expressed a range of views on the potential benefits and costs of different types of inflation ranges. Most participants expressed concern that introducing a symmetric inflation range around the 2 percent objective following an extended period of inflation mostly running somewhat below 2 percent could be misperceived as a signal that the Committee was comfortable with contin- ued misses below its symmetric inflation objective. Many participants agreed that an uncertainty range could be misinterpreted as an indifference range and hence as a lack of commitment by the Committee to its symmet- ric 2 percent inflation objective. Some participants sug- gested that it was not clear that introducing a range would help much in achieving the Committee’s inflation objective; they noted that introducing a range could make that objective less clear to the public. Instead of establishing a range, the Committee could continue to communicate that its inflation objective was symmetric around 2 percent. While inflation is inherently variable, the Committee then could emphasize its intention for inflation to be centered on the 2 percent objective. Nev- ertheless, in view of the inherent variability of inflation, several participants judged that there could be some ben- efit in communicating the inflation objective with a sym- metric range around the point target. In addition, a few participants suggested that an inflation range could con- vey the uncertainty associated with the available array of inflation measures or that the Committee’s communica- tions could more explicitly reference other measures of inflation. Several participants also stated that employing an asymmetric operational range for a time—with 2 per- cent being at or near the lower end of that range—while still maintaining the longer-run target of 2 percent could help communicate that the Committee intended infla- tion to average 2 percent over time, which in turn could help keep longer-run inflation expectations at levels con- sistent with its objective. Participants expected that, at upcoming meetings, they would continue their deliberations on the Committee’s review of monetary policy strategy, tools, and communi- cation practices. Participants continued to anticipate that the review will likely be completed around the mid- dle of this year. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. For most of the period, risk asset prices rose as market participants fo- cused on a perceived reduction in downside risks to the economic outlook, favorable data on foreign economic activity, and expectations of continued monetary policy accommodation in the United States and other major economies. Some market participants suggested that the Federal Reserve’s actions in the fourth quarter to main- tain ample reserve levels might have contributed to some degree to the rise in equity and other risk asset prices. Over the final few days of the intermeeting period, fi- nancial markets responded to news of the spread of the coronavirus that started in China, which reportedly con- tributed to downward moves in Treasury yields and, to a lesser extent, U.S. equity prices. On balance, U.S. fi- nancial conditions became more accommodative over the intermeeting period, with equity prices rising nota- bly. Despite signs of reduced risks to the outlook and of some stabilization in economic activity abroad, financial market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy appeared to have changed little over the intermeeting period. Market-based indicators continued to point to expectations that the target range for the fed- eral funds rate will be lowered by roughly 30 basis points this year. This was consistent with responses to the Open Market Desk’s survey, which continued to indi- cate that, while market participants viewed no change this year in the target range as the most likely outcome, they placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over the year than on an increase. Market commentary attributed the stability in federal funds rate expectations despite the perceived reduction in down- side risks partly to the Committee’s communications; some market participants reportedly regarded those communications as signaling a relatively high bar for changes to the target range. In addition, results from the Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Desk’s surveys suggested that, notwithstanding the abatement in some risks over recent months, many mar- ket participants continued to see risks to the economic outlook as skewed to the downside. The manager turned next to a review of money market developments and Desk operations. The federal funds rate was stable over the year-end date and remained close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. On- going reserve management purchases of Treasury bills and the Desk’s repurchase agreement (repo) operations kept aggregate reserves above the level that prevailed in early September, contributing to relatively calm money market conditions around year-end. Market participants cited funding from the additional longer-term repo op- erations spanning year-end and increased capacity in daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions in short-term funding markets. In addition, market par- ticipants prepared earlier than usual for year-end, with borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending capacity. Since year-end, money market rates remained stable, with the Desk’s longer-term repos maturing with no dis- cernible effect on market conditions and reserve man- agement purchases of Treasury bills proceeding smoothly. At the current pace of $60 billion per month, the staff’s estimates suggested that after April of this year, the Desk’s reserve management purchases will re- store the permanent base of reserves to levels above those prevailing in early September 2019. Although re- serves are projected to be above $1.5 trillion before April, a surge in the Treasury General Account balance during the April tax season is expected to briefly reduce reserve levels and, in the absence of repo operations, bring reserves down temporarily to around $1.5 trillion. The manager discussed a potential plan for gradually transitioning to an operational approach designed to maintain ample reserve levels without the active use of repo operations to supply reserves. Under this plan, repo operations would be maintained at least through April to ensure ample reserve conditions. However, the Desk would continue the gradual reduction and consol- idation of its repo offerings ahead of April, with the plan of phasing out term repo operations after April. As part of this transition, the minimum bid rate on repo opera- tions could be gradually lifted, and the Committee could consider whether there is a role for repo operations in the implementation framework. In the second quarter, the manager expected reserve conditions to support slowing the pace of Treasury bill purchases, with the goal of eventually aligning growth of the Federal Reserve’s Treasury holdings with trend growth in its liabilities. As that time approaches, the Committee might wish to consider the appropriate ma- turity composition of reserve management purchases of Treasury securities. The manager noted that, although the pace of Treasury purchases would likely continue into the second quarter, the rate of expansion in the Fed- eral Reserve’s balance sheet would moderate during the first half of 2020 as repo outstanding was gradually re- duced. The manager’s briefing addressed the possibility of a small technical adjustment to the Federal Reserve’s ad- ministered rates in light of the stability in money market conditions over recent months. With this adjustment, the Board would lift the interest rates on required and excess reserves by 5 basis points, and the FOMC would implement an equal-sized upward adjustment to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement offer rate. This technical adjustment would reverse the small downward adjustment to administered rates made in September, when money markets were volatile. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available for the January 28–29 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a moderate rate in the fourth quarter of 2019. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in Novem- ber. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation ex- pectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose in December, and the solid pace of job gains over the second half of 2019 was somewhat above that for the first half. How- ever, the rate of increase in payrolls in 2019 was slower than in 2018, whether or not one accounted for the an- ticipated effects of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ bench- mark revision to payroll employment, which was sched- uled for early February. The unemployment rate held steady at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in December, and the labor force participation rate and the employment- to-population ratio were unchanged as well. The unem- ployment rates for African Americans, Asians, Hispan- ics, and whites were below their levels at the end of the _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 11 previous economic expansion. Although persistent dif- ferentials between these rates remained, they have gen- erally narrowed during the expansion. The average share of workers employed part time for economic reasons in November stayed below its level in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings declined, on net, in Octo- ber and November but was still at a fairly high level; the rate of quits, which was also at a high level, edged up. The four-week moving average of initial claims for un- employment insurance benefits through mid-January re- mained near historically low levels. Nominal wage growth was moderate, with average hourly earnings for all employees increasing 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12-month period. Consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation, and consumer energy prices declined. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at 2 per- cent in November. The consumer price index (CPI) and the core CPI both rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in December. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers’ measure for the next 5 to 10 years moved back up in early January after having fallen to its lowest value on record in December. Mean- while, the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Re- serve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expec- tations remained near its historical low in December. Real PCE appeared to have risen more slowly in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Retail sales were soft during the fourth quarter, and sales of light motor vehicles declined in December after a strong gain in No- vember. However, key factors that influence consumer spending—including the low unemployment rate, the upward trend in real disposable income, high levels of households’ net worth, and generally low interest rates— remained supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, recent readings on consumer confidence from both the University of Michigan and the Conference Board surveys were strong. Real residential investment appeared to have increased solidly again in the fourth quarter. Starts for single-fam- ily homes increased sharply over the November and De- cember period, building permit issuance for such homes rose on net, and starts of multifamily units also moved up. Existing home sales increased, on balance, in No- vember and December, while new home sales declined. All told, the data on residential construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 had been boosting housing activity. The available data pointed to another decline in real non- residential private fixed investment in the fourth quarter, with a further contraction in structures investment more than offsetting a modest rise in investment in equipment and intangibles. Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed in the fourth quarter. Although some measures of business sentiment improved, analysts’ expectations of firms’ longer-term profit growth edged down further, concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms’ investment decisions, and reduced deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max were likely restraining investment. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued to decline in November. The total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of busi- ness spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—was little changed, on net, through mid-January, though still below levels seen over the latter part of 2019. Industrial production (IP) increased, on net, in Novem- ber and December, partly because of a pickup in motor vehicle production following the strike at General Mo- tors. Even so, IP was lower than a year earlier, with de- clines in manufacturing production and the output of utilities only partly offset by an increase in mining out- put. Automakers’ schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would increase in the first quar- ter, but that gain appeared likely to be offset by Boeing’s curtailed production of the 737 Max aircraft and, more generally, by mixed readings on new orders from na- tional and regional manufacturing surveys. Total real government purchases appeared to have in- creased moderately in the fourth quarter. Nominal de- fense spending in November and December pointed to only a moderate rise in real federal government pur- chases. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to have risen a little faster than in the third quar- ter; nominal construction spending by these govern- ments increased solidly in November, and state and local payrolls expanded modestly in December. Real net exports were estimated to have provided a sub- stantial boost to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter. Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Available monthly data suggested that imports fell sig- nificantly, led by declines in consumer goods and auto- mobiles, while exports were about flat. implied by overnight index swap quotes, moved down slightly, on net, and implied about a 30 basis point de- cline in the federal funds rate from its current level. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic growth slowed further in the fourth quarter to a very subdued pace. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), growth appeared to have remained weak as the manu- facturing slump continued and a consumption tax hike in Japan led to a sharp contraction in household spend- ing. In the emerging economies, social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in Hong Kong and Chile, while the labor strike at General Motors was a further drag on Mexico’s already weak economy. In contrast, early GDP releases showed a pickup in growth in China and some other Asian economies, though news of the coronavirus outbreak raised questions about the sustain- ability of that pickup. Foreign inflation rose in the wake of temporary factors in India and China, while it re- mained soft in most AFEs, in part reflecting previous declines in energy prices and muted core inflation pres- sures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investor sentiment improved, on balance, over the inter- meeting period, mostly reflecting progress related to the phase-one trade deal between the United States and China and its subsequent signing, the perception that the probability of a disorderly Brexit had declined, signs of stabilization in the global economic outlook, and, report- edly, continued confidence that monetary policy in the United States and other major economies would remain accommodative in the near term. Late in the period, concerns about the spread of the coronavirus and uncer- tainty about its potential economic effect weighed nega- tively on investor sentiment and led to moderate declines in the prices of risky assets. On net, equity prices in- creased notably over the intermeeting period, while cor- porate bond spreads were little changed and yields on nominal Treasury securities declined. Financing condi- tions for businesses and households eased a bit further and generally remained supportive of spending and eco- nomic activity. Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period reportedly reinforced investors’ beliefs that a near-term change to the target range for the federal funds rate was unlikely. Consistent with those reports, a straight read of the probability distributions for the fed- eral funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged over the next few months. Expec- tations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2020, as Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined, on net, across the maturity spectrum over the intermeeting pe- riod, while the spread between the yields on nominal 10- and 2-year Treasury securities was little changed. Measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on Treasury Infla- tion-Protected Securities decreased, on net, but re- mained above their October 2019 lows. Broad stock price indexes increased notably, on balance, over the intermeeting period, with gains largely at- tributed to improved market sentiment about trade ne- gotiations and a perceived lower probability of a disor- derly Brexit. Late in the period, equity prices retraced some of their gains, as concerns about the spread of the coronavirus weighed negatively on risk sentiment. Overall movements in stock prices varied widely across economic sectors, with stocks of firms in the infor- mation technology and utilities sectors significantly out- performing aggregate indexes, while stock prices of firms in the energy sector declined markedly. Option- implied volatility on the S&P 500 index increased a bit, on balance, while corporate credit spreads were little changed. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets, in- cluding in secured financing, were stable over the inter- meeting period, even over year-end. Rates declined slightly, likely reflecting increased liquidity and a higher level of reserves provided by the Desk’s open market operations. The effective federal funds rate remained close to the IOER rate, and spreads for term unsecured commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed substantially, particularly after year-end. The Desk’s open market operations proceeded smoothly. For most of the intermeeting period, foreign equity prices rose amid progress on U.S.–China trade negotia- tions, generally favorable data on global economic activ- ity, and the reduced risk of a disorderly Brexit following the U.K. general election. Late in the period, however, concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China weighed on risk sentiment. On balance, most major for- eign equity indexes increased modestly, and AFE long- term sovereign yields ended the period somewhat lower. U.K. and Canadian yields declined more than elsewhere against the backdrop of central bank communications that were interpreted as increasing the likelihood of pol- icy easing in those countries. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 13 The broad dollar index weakened slightly over the pe- riod, predominantly against emerging market currencies. The Chinese renminbi appreciated notably against the dollar on positive trade policy developments, but this gain was more than undone late in the period by con- cerns about the coronavirus. The Mexican peso strengthened against the dollar, supported by progress on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and Bank of Mexico communications that were perceived as less accommodative than expected. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative, on balance, with corporate borrowing costs staying near historical lows during the intermeeting period. Gross issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds was subdued in January and December after surg- ing in November. Issuance of speculative-grade bonds over the intermeeting period remained about in line with the average pace over December and January in recent years. Institutional leveraged loan issuance continued to be robust in December, reflecting solid refinancing ac- tivity and moderate new money issuance. Meanwhile, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ balance sheets contracted in the fourth quarter. Respondents to the January 2020 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that bor- rower demand weakened for C&I loans over the fourth quarter, and lending standards on such loans were little changed. Gross equity issuance through seasoned offer- ings remained robust in December, while initial public offerings continued to be quite light. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations and the earnings outlook remained generally stable in recent months. Credit con- ditions for both small businesses and municipalities re- mained accommodative on net. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions also remained generally accommodative. The volume of agency and non-agency commercial mort- gage-backed securities issuance grew notably in the fourth quarter, buoyed by lower interest rates, and the growth of CRE loans on banks’ books picked up over this period. Responses to the January 2020 SLOOS sug- gested that lending standards and demand for most CRE loan categories were unchanged in the fourth quarter. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative on balance. Mortgage rates decreased notably during the intermeeting period, reach- ing recent-year lows. Home-purchase originations re- mained around post-crisis highs, and mortgage refinanc- ing activity continued at a strong pace through Decem- ber. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained supportive of growth in consumer spending, al- though the supply of credit remained relatively tight for nonprime borrowers. The growth of credit card bal- ances slowed in the fourth quarter, and, according to the January SLOOS, commercial banks tightened their standards on credit card loans over this period. Auto loan growth maintained a solid pace in recent months amid declining interest rates through year-end. The staff provided an update on its assessments of po- tential risks to financial stability. On balance, the finan- cial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system were char- acterized as moderate. The staff judged that asset valu- ation pressures had increased in recent months to an el- evated level. Asset valuation pressures were character- ized as fairly widespread across a number of markets, similar to the situation in much of 2017 and 2018. In assessing vulnerabilities stemming from borrowing in the household and business sectors, the staff noted that, while the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP was fairly low, the ratio of business debt to nominal GDP was high by historical standards. At the same time, ma- jor financial institutions were viewed as resilient, in part because of high levels of capital at banks. Nonetheless, the staff noted that banks had announced that they in- tend to allow their capital ratios to decline closer to reg- ulatory requirements over the medium term. Vulnera- bilities stemming from funding risk were characterized as moderate. While the money market strains in Sep- tember raised some questions about vulnerabilities in funding markets, the staff assessed that the core of the financial system remains resilient to vulnerabilities from maturity and liquidity transformation. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U.S. real GDP growth prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than in the previous forecast. Data pertaining to the fourth quarter of 2019, particularly on imports, sug- gested output rose faster at the end of the year than was previously projected, and this faster pace seemed con- sistent with the solid employment gains in the fourth quarter. In addition, more supportive financial condi- tions and the anticipated effects of the phase-one trade deal between the United States and China pushed up the staff’s GDP forecast for this year and next. All told, real GDP growth was projected to be about the same in 2020 as in 2019 and then to slow modestly in the coming years, partly because of a fading boost from fiscal policy. Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff’s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2020 and 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ output growth in 2022. The unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further this year and to re- main at that lower level through 2022; the unemploy- ment rate was anticipated to be below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate throughout the forecast pe- riod. The staff’s forecasts for both total and core PCE price inflation over the 2020–22 period were essentially unre- vised. Core inflation was still projected to step up a little in 2020 but to run a bit below 2 percent both this year and over the next two years. Total PCE price inflation was projected to be a little lower than core inflation in 2020 because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices and to be the same as core inflation in 2021 and 2022. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having diminished a bit further since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate. Important factors influencing this assessment were that foreign economic and geopo- litical developments still seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the U.S. economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed. In addition, softness in business investment and manufacturing production last year, as well as the recent weakness in imports, was seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected. The risks to the infla- tion projection were also viewed as having a downward skew, in part because of the downside risks to the fore- cast for economic activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 per- cent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in- flation expectations were little changed. Participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. They expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace, supported by ac- commodative monetary and financial conditions. In ad- dition, some trade uncertainties had diminished recently, and there were some signs of stabilization in global growth. Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remained, including those posed by the outbreak of the coronavirus. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that spending growth had moderated in the fourth quarter. However, they generally expected that, in the period ahead, consumption spending would likely re- main on a firm footing, supported by strong labor mar- ket conditions, rising incomes, and healthy household balance sheets. Some participants noted the upbeat tone of consumer surveys, and a few commented that their District contacts had reported solid retail sales during the holiday shopping season. In addition, many partici- pants were encouraged by the significant pickup since last summer in residential investment, a development that reflected, in part, the effects of lower mortgage rates. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that business investment and exports remained weak and that manufacturing output had declined over the past year. Looking ahead, participants were generally cautiously optimistic about the effects on the business sector of the recent favorable trade developments and the signs of stabilization in global growth. Many partic- ipants expressed the view that these developments might boost business confidence or raise export demand, which would help strengthen or at least stabilize business investment. A few participants remarked that contacts in their Districts had noted that business sentiment was brighter or that companies were intending to expand their capital expenditures this year. Several other partic- ipants, however, judged that the effect of the recent trade agreement with China would be relatively limited, as trade uncertainty would likely remain elevated, with the possibility remaining of the emergence of new ten- sions as well as the reescalation of existing tensions. They noted that the agreement would still leave a large portion of tariffs in place and that many firms had al- ready been making production and supply chain adjust- ments in response to trade tensions. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 15 Participants also commented on ongoing challenges fac- ing the energy and agriculture sectors. A couple of par- ticipants remarked that activity in the energy sector con- tinued to be weak, and a few noted that financial condi- tions in the agricultural sector would likely remain chal- lenging for many despite farm subsidies from the federal government and recent optimism surrounding trade prospects. Participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong, with the unemployment rate at a 50-year low and continued solid job gains, on average. Although the upcoming annual benchmark revision was expected to reduce estimates of recent payroll growth, participants expected payroll employment to expand at a healthy pace this year. Business contacts in many Dis- tricts indicated continued strong labor demand, with several participants mentioning that contacts reported difficulties in finding qualified workers or that observed wage growth might currently understate the degree of tightness in the labor market. However, a number of participants indicated that aggregate measures of nomi- nal wages continued to rise at a moderate pace broadly in line with productivity growth and the rate of inflation. Several participants commented on potential reasons for the absence of stronger broad-based wage pressures, in- cluding technological changes that could substitute for labor, increased willingness of employees to forgo wage gains for greater job stability, adjustments in nonwage portions of compensation packages, and the possibility that the labor market was not as tight as the historically low unemployment rate would suggest. Many partici- pants pointed to the strong performance of labor force participation despite the downward pressures associated with an aging population, and several raised the possibil- ity that there was some room for labor force participa- tion to rise further. In their discussion of inflation developments, partici- pants noted that recent readings on overall and core PCE price inflation, measured on a 12-month basis, had continued to run below 2 percent. Overall, participants described their inflation outlook as having changed little since December. Participants generally expected infla- tion to move closer to 2 percent in the coming months as the unusually low readings in early 2019 drop out of the 12-month calculation. Participants also expected that, as the economic expansion continues and resource utilization remains high, inflation would return to the 2 percent objective on a sustainable basis. A few partic- ipants expressed less confidence in this outlook for in- flation and commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as re- source utilization had increased, or pointed to down- ward pressures from global or technology-related factors that could continue to suppress inflation. A couple of participants, however, noted that some alternative infla- tion indicators, including trimmed mean measures, sug- gested that there had been a modest step-up in underly- ing inflation during 2019 or that underlying inflation could already be at a level consistent with the Commit- tee’s goal. Participants generally saw the distribution of risks to the outlook for economic activity as somewhat more favor- able than at the previous meeting, although a number of downside risks remained prominent. The easing of trade tensions resulting from the recent agreement with China and the passage of the USMCA as well as tentative signs of stabilization in global economic growth helped reduce downside risks and appeared to buoy business senti- ment. The risk of a “hard” Brexit had appeared to re- cede further. In addition, statistical models designed to estimate the probability of recession using financial mar- ket data suggested that the likelihood of a recession oc- curring over the next year had fallen notably in recent months. Still, participants generally expected trade-re- lated uncertainty to remain somewhat elevated, and they were mindful of the possibility that the tentative signs of stabilization in global growth could fade. Geopolitical risks, especially in connection with the Middle East, re- mained. The threat of the coronavirus, in addition to its human toll, had emerged as a new risk to the global growth outlook, which participants agreed warranted close watching. In their discussion of financial stability, participants acknowledged the staff report suggesting that overall fi- nancial vulnerabilities remained moderate and that the financial system remained resilient. Nonetheless, several participants observed that equity, corporate debt, and CRE valuations were elevated and drew attention to high levels of corporate indebtedness and weak underwriting standards in leveraged loan markets. Some participants expressed the concern that financial imbalances—in- cluding overvaluation and excessive indebtedness— could amplify an adverse shock to the economy, that the current conditions of low interest rates and labor market tightness could increase risks to financial stability, or that cyber attacks could affect the U.S. financial system. Sev- eral participants noted that planned increases in dividend payouts by large banks and the associated decline in cap- ital buffers might leave those banks with less capacity to weather adverse shocks—which could have negative im- plications for the economy—or that lower bank capital Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ ratios could be associated with greater tail risks to GDP growth. On the other hand, capital levels at U.S. banks were quite high relative to other sectors of the financial system, raising questions about the potential migration of lending activities away from the U.S. banking sector to areas outside the oversight of federal banking super- visors. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants judged that it would be appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation re- turning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive. With regard to monetary policy beyond this meet- ing, participants viewed the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time, provided that in- coming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with this economic outlook. Of course, if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook, an adjustment to the stance of monetary policy would be appropriate, in order to foster achievement of the Committee’s dual-mandate objectives. In commenting on the monetary policy outlook, partici- pants concurred that maintaining the current stance of policy would give the Committee time for a fuller assess- ment of the ongoing effects on economic activity of last year’s shift to a more accommodative policy stance and would also allow policymakers to accumulate further in- formation bearing on the economic outlook. Partici- pants discussed how maintaining the current policy stance for a time could be helpful in supporting U.S. eco- nomic activity and employment in the face of global de- velopments that have been weighing on spending deci- sions. With regard to the Committee’s price-stability objective, participants observed that the current degree of mone- tary policy accommodation would be useful in facilitat- ing a return of inflation to 2 percent. Several participants noted that inflation returning to 2 percent would help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remained consistent with the Committee’s longer-run inflation ob- jective. A few participants stressed that the Committee should be more explicit about the need to achieve its in- flation goal on a sustained basis. Several participants suggested that inflation modestly exceeding 2 percent for a period would be consistent with the achievement of the Committee’s longer-run inflation objective and that such mild overshooting might underscore the sym- metry of that objective. With regard to the Committee’s maximum employment objective, a few participants ob- served that the actual level of employment might still be below maximum employment and that maintaining the present monetary policy stance would allow the econ- omy to achieve that maximum level. A couple of other participants expressed concern that tight labor markets have in the past been associated with economic and fi- nancial imbalances and that the emergence of such im- balances might jeopardize the longer-run attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming op- erational measures. Participants agreed that the opera- tions undertaken by the Desk since mid-September had been effective in helping to stabilize conditions in money markets and that implementation of the plan that the Committee announced in October to purchase Treasury bills and conduct repo operations had proceeded smoothly. Participants observed that enactment of this plan had succeeded in replenishing reserve balances to levels at or above those prevailing in early September 2019 and in ensuring continued control of the federal funds rate. Many participants stressed that, as reserves approached durably ample levels, the need for sizable Treasury bill purchases and repo operations would di- minish and that such operations could be gradually scaled back or phased out. Beyond that point, regular open market operations would be required over time in order to accommodate the trend growth in the Federal Reserve’s liabilities and maintain an ample level of re- serves. Participants who commented on the Desk’s pro- posal for the transition to the ample-reserves regime in- dicated that they were comfortable with that proposal. They remarked that the details of the Committee’s plans would be adjusted as appropriate to support effective implementation of monetary policy. Participants noted that it would be important to continue to communicate to the public that open market operations now and in the period ahead were technical operations aimed at achieving and maintaining ample reserves and that any adjustments to those operations were not intended to represent a change in the stance of monetary policy. Several participants suggested that the Committee should resume before long its discussion of the role that repo operations might play in an ample-reserves regime, including the possible creation of a standing repo facility. A couple of these participants cited the potential for such a facility to reduce the banking system’s demand for reserves over the longer term. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 28–29, 2020Page 17 Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been ris- ing at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on av- erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Although household spending had been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remained weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and en- ergy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; sur- vey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions were little changed. Members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. Members judged that the current stance of monetary policy was appropri- ate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Members also agreed that, in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the fed- eral funds rate, the Committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent infla- tion objective. And they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed that incoming data warranted a change in the statement’s description of recent rises in household spending from “strong” to “moderate.” They also agreed to describe the current monetary policy stance as consistent with inflation “returning to,” rather than be- ing “near,” their symmetric 2 percent longer-run objec- tive. In commenting on this change in wording, a few members noted that the new language would make the postmeeting statement more consistent with the Com- mittee’s outlook or might usefully affirm the symmetry of the Committee’s inflation goal and indicate that poli- cymakers were not satisfied with inflation outcomes that were persistently below 2 percent. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective January 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent. In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early Sep- tember 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to continue conducting term and over- night repurchase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementa- tion. In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per- counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treas- ury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Page 18Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Although household spending has been rising at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12‑month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are run- ning below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expec- tations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employ- ment and price stability. The Committee de- cided to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. The Com- mittee judges that the current stance of mone- tary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including global devel- opments and muted inflation pressures, as it as- sesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1.60 percent. Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10 basis points above the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve estab- lishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective January 30, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 17–18, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 9:50 a.m. on January 29, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on January 2, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on December 10–11, 2019. _______________________ James A.

Financial markets remained exception- ally volatile amid the global spread of the coronavirus and uncertainty regarding its effects. Since the meeting of the FOMC in late January, the S&P 500 index de- clined 18 percent, nominal U.S. Treasury yields moved 60 to 100 basis points lower, and market-based measures of inflation compensation fell 75 to 100 basis points. Investment-grade and high-yield credit spreads widened about 120 basis points and 360 basis points, respectively. The U.S. dollar appreciated notably against most curren- cies, with the exception of other safe-haven currencies, and crude oil prices dropped 40 percent. Against this backdrop, expectations for the path of the federal funds rate adjusted sharply. Implied rates on federal funds fu- tures contracts suggested the Committee was expected to reduce the target range 1 full percentage point at its upcoming scheduled meeting following the 50 basis point reduction in the target range in early March. In addition, market participants reportedly anticipated that the Committee would announce additional purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securi- ties (MBS). Trading conditions across a range of markets were se- verely strained. In corporate bond markets, trading ac- tivity and liquidity were at very low levels, although not back to the low point reached in 2008. Market partici- pants expected that actions taken to slow the spread of the virus could have significant effects on the credit wor- thiness of certain borrowers, particularly those at the lower end of the credit spectrum. Market participants also increasingly pointed to concerns in other segments of the debt market. In securitized markets, including those for asset-backed securities (ABS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), primary market is- suance slowed, and secondary market trading had be- come less orderly, with money managers selling short- dated liquid products to meet investor redemptions. In the Treasury market, following several consecutive days of deteriorating conditions, market participants re- ported an acute decline in market liquidity. A number of primary dealers found it especially difficult to make markets in off-the-run Treasury securities and reported that this segment of the market had ceased to function effectively. This disruption in intermediation was at- tributed, in part, to sales of off-the-run Treasury securi- ties and flight-to-quality flows into the most liquid, on-the-run Treasury securities. Conditions in short-term funding markets also deterio- rated sharply amid a decline in market liquidity and chal- lenges in dealer intermediation. Over recent days, the premium paid to obtain dollars through the foreign ex- change swap market increased sharply, and the volumes in term repurchase agreement (repo) markets dropped significantly. Issuance of commercial paper (CP) matur- ing beyond one week reportedly almost dried up at the end of the week before the meeting, and primary- and secondary-market liquidity for financial and nonfinancial CP was described as nearly nonexistent at a time when investor concern about issuer credit risk was rising. The manager then summarized actions taken by the Desk to address some of the strains in financial markets. Repo lending operations were greatly expanded to ad- dress the acute worsening in term funding markets; these operations included the addition of large-scale one- and three-month term repo operations. Despite the sizable offering of additional term repo, take-up was well below the offered amounts, and there was little improvement in Treasury market functioning. As a result, the Chair, in consultation with the FOMC, instructed the Desk to conduct purchases of Treasury securities across a range of maturities. The Desk also revised the schedule of Treasury purchases, announcing that $37 billion of the monthly scheduled purchases would be completed on Friday, March 13. These purchases were conducted across the curve. Market participants suggested that the Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ operations had been helpful in addressing some funding pressures, but trading conditions in Treasury, mortgage, and credit markets remained severely strained. The SOMA manager noted that, if the FOMC directed the Desk to conduct additional purchases of MBS and Treasury securities, the Desk could initially conduct such purchases at a more rapid pace to more quickly address liquidity strains. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. No intervention operations occurred in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak was disrupting economic ac- tivity in many countries, including the United States, by the time of the March 15 meeting. There were limited available U.S. economic data, however, that covered the period since the intensification of concerns about the domestic effects of the outbreak. Information that pre- dated that period indicated that labor market conditions had remained strong through February and that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to have been increasing at a moderate pace in the first two months of the year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in January. Survey-based measures of longer- run inflation expectations were little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in January and February, and the unemployment rate was at its 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate and the employment- to-population ratio edged up on net. Initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits—a timely indicator of a deterioration in labor market conditions—remained near historically low levels through early March, which was still before economic shutdowns started to take place in the United States. Nominal wage growth was moderate on balance. Average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3 percent over the 12 months end- ing in February. The employment cost index for private- sector workers increased 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in December, while total labor compensation per hour in the business sector—a highly volatile measure of wage gains—rose 3.6 percent over the four quarters of last year. Total consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) was 1.6 percent over that same 12-month period. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 2.1 percent in January. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in February, and the core CPI increased 2.4 percent over that same period. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months. The Survey of Professional Forecasters measure for the next 10 years was unchanged in the first quarter, as was the longer-run measure from the Blue Chip survey in March. The Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged down in February and re- mained in the lower part of its prevailing range in early March. The three-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Ex- pectations edged up in February and remained in its re- cent range. Real PCE growth was moderate in January. The com- ponents of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE edged down in February, and the pace of sales of light motor vehicles in January and February was above its fourth-quarter average. However, the consumer sen- timent measure from the Michigan survey started to de- cline notably in early March, and other daily and weekly sentiment measures—such as the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, the Morning Consult confidence index, and the Rasmussen Consumer Index—were also deteri- orating. Both starts and building permit issuance for single- family homes increased in January over their fourth- quarter averages, and starts of multifamily units also moved up. New and existing home sales in January were both above their average fourth-quarter levels. Nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense cap- ital goods excluding aircraft increased solidly in January, although the anticipated resumption of deliveries of the Boeing 737 Max was delayed until later in the year. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures outside of the drilling and mining sector increased in January. The total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—was edging up through mid-March and was not yet showing any of the expected falloff from the recent sharp declines in crude oil prices. The available data suggested that manufacturing produc- tion moved up in February after edging down in January, leaving the level of factory output little changed, on net, Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ over the past 12 months. Although output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil extraction—had in- creased in January, available data indicated that output in this sector would decrease in February; the recent sharp declines in crude oil prices pointed to a reduction in min- ing-sector production over at least the near term. Total real government purchases appeared to be increas- ing moderately. Federal defense spending rose in Janu- ary and February, and federal employment was boosted by hiring for the 2020 census. State and local govern- ment payrolls expanded strongly in January and Febru- ary, and nominal construction spending by these govern- ments increased solidly in January. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in January, as a steep fall in imports more than offset a de- cline in exports. The fall in imports, which followed a sizable fourth-quarter decline, was led by lower imports of industrial supplies, automotive products, and capital goods. The decline in exports was driven by lower ex- ports of capital goods and industrial supplies. Available indicators suggested that both exports and imports likely declined in February, in part reflecting disruptions re- lated to the coronavirus outbreak. The pace of economic growth abroad was already sub- dued before the outbreak. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth had slowed sharply at the end of 2019, and indicators pointed to only a modest pickup in economic growth early this year. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), incoming data had been more positive, as indicators for high-tech and manufacturing production in Asian economies outside of China were upbeat, and the effects of social protests in Chile and Hong Kong, along with the effects of the General Motors strike on Mexican economic activity, had faded. By early February, however, the coronavirus outbreak in China brought economic activity in many parts of the country to a standstill. Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak and a manufacturing hub, was put under quarantine, and factories across the country were shut down. Foreign economic indicators for the more recent period, following the spread of the virus to the rest of the world, were generally not yet available. However, widespread shutdowns together with lower commodity prices and tighter financial conditions sug- gested that activity was weakening sharply in most for- eign economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Concerns about the coronavirus outbreak dominated fi- nancial market developments at home and abroad over the intermeeting period. Equity prices, sovereign yields, and the market-implied expected trajectory of the federal funds rate all plummeted, and the volatility of asset prices soared. Late in the intermeeting period, short- term funding markets showed signs of stress, with ele- vated demand for repo funding and increased short-term spreads. Trading conditions for Treasury securities and MBS were impaired. Moreover, primary issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds was sporadic, and that of speculative-grade corporate bonds and leveraged loans virtually stopped after late February. Data from before the escalation of coronavirus concerns in late February suggested that financial conditions for nonfi- nancial businesses and for households had generally re- mained supportive of economic activity and spending, but developments late in the intermeeting period pointed to tightening credit conditions. Expectations for the path of the federal funds rate de- clined sharply over the intermeeting period. Toward the end of the period, a straight read of overnight index swap (OIS) quotes suggested that the federal funds rate would remain below 25 basis points at least until the middle of 2021. After the 50 basis point decrease in the target range on March 3, prices of federal funds futures options suggested that investors assigned a significant probability to the target range decreasing to 0 to 25 basis points at or before the scheduled March meeting. Yields on nominal Treasury securities plummeted across the maturity spectrum, with the 10- and 30-year yields reaching all-time lows at some point. A staff term struc- ture model largely attributed the decline in the 10-year yield to lower expected future short-term rates. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities fell sharply and reached a historical low at the 5-to-10-year horizon late in the in- termeeting period. Uncertainty regarding future interest rates increased sharply over the intermeeting period. At one point, the one-month-ahead swaption-implied volatility of the 10-year swap rate surpassed its highest level seen during the “taper tantrum” episode in mid-2013. Treasury mar- ket functioning was severely impaired late in the inter- meeting period, with some dealers reportedly unwilling to make markets for clients and the normal linkage be- tween cash and futures markets broken. Market depth was extremely thin, and bid-ask spreads widened sharply. Broad stock price indexes plummeted because of a flight to safety amid escalating concerns about global eco- nomic activity. Although the declines were broad based, the airline, energy, and bank sectors were among the worst performers. Stock price indexes were extremely Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ volatile, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index soared, sometimes reaching levels not seen since the fall of 2008. Corporate bond spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened sig- nificantly, and spreads on speculative-grade energy bonds widened especially sharply amid plunging oil prices. The 50 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate announced on March 3 passed through fully to overnight unsecured and secured rates. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets showed signs of funding strains late in the intermeeting period. The rates on unsecured CP and negotiable cer- tificates of deposit with maturities exceeding one month increased sharply relative to OIS rates, with pronounced effects for issuers in the energy and transportation sec- tors. Overnight and term repo rates were elevated late in the intermeeting period, and the take-up of the Fed- eral Reserve’s repo operations increased substantially for both overnight and term operations. Over the intermeeting period, foreign risk asset prices plummeted amid a rapid deterioration of investor senti- ment due to the global spread of the coronavirus. Major foreign equity indexes dropped sharply over the inter- meeting period, while option-implied volatility measures climbed to their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. EME fund outflows accelerated late in the period as emerging market bond spreads widened notably. Most AFE long-term sovereign yields ended the period notably lower. Inflation compensation in the euro area reached new lows. In response to the economic effect of the virus, several central banks cut policy rates and injected liquidity. The broad dollar index strengthened notably over the period, boosted by safe-haven demand, predominantly against EME currencies, and despite a significant decline in U.S. yields. Safe-haven demand also bolstered the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Policy actions by Chinese authorities supported the Chinese renminbi, which de- preciated about 1.5 percent against the dollar on net. Other EME currencies, such as the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, depreciated sharply, as market partici- pants viewed them as particularly vulnerable to a global economic slowdown and declining commodity prices. Oil prices declined over 40 percent on expectations of lower demand due to the virus outbreak and an unex- pected price cut by Saudi Arabia amid a breakdown of negotiations between OPEC and Russia to reduce pro- duction levels. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms were strained over the late part of the intermeeting period. After robust issuance earlier in the first quarter, corpo- rate bond issuance came to a near standstill around late February in the midst of elevated volatility following the escalation of concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. Later in the intermeeting period, investment-grade bond issuance resumed intermittently, but speculative-grade issuance and leveraged loan issuance virtually stopped. In addition, some firms reportedly postponed plans to go public. Commercial and industrial loan growth was modest. Credit quality indicators for nonfinancial cor- porations had been solid earlier in the quarter but dete- riorated following the escalation of the coronavirus out- break, particularly for the speculative-grade and energy segments of the market. Measures of the year-ahead ex- pected default rate increased in March to levels slightly under those observed during the oil price plunge in early 2016, reflecting higher expected default rates among speculative-grade firms as well as energy firms. In addi- tion, the outlook for corporate earnings deteriorated somewhat, as equity analysts revised down their earnings per share estimates a notch, and several firms warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt their earnings and make them difficult to predict. The supply of credit to small businesses over the fourth quarter of last year had remained relatively accommodative, but loan origi- nations ticked down in January, consistent with ongoing reports of weak loan demand. Market turmoil spilled into municipal bond markets late in the intermeeting period, as spreads widened substan- tially and some borrowers became hesitant to come to the market. Credit conditions in the municipal market had been accommodative over the early part of the in- termeeting period, and issuance volumes in late February were reportedly boosted by strong investor demand for low-risk assets. Financing conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector worsened late in the intermeeting period, as issuance of CMBS slowed and spreads widened nota- bly to around levels seen in 2016. Data from before the escalation of concerns over the coronavirus outbreak pointed to accommodative financing conditions. CRE loan growth at banks remained solid through February and CRE debt outstanding increased modestly through mid-February, according to available data. The primary mortgage rate increased sharply toward the end of the period as MBS market liquidity deteriorated, after falling substantially in February and early March. Capacity constraints at mortgage originators reportedly Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ intensified, while borrower interest in refinancing in- creased significantly from already elevated levels. More- over, additional constraints emerged as it became more difficult to conduct operations that usually happen face- to-face. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets wors- ened late in the intermeeting period. Strains began ap- pearing in consumer ABS markets, although less so than in other fixed-income markets. In March, consumer ABS spreads widened sharply, liquidity deteriorated, and new issuance became sporadic. Lenders in consumer credit markets began developing programs to assist bor- rowers whose finances were affected by the outbreak. Earlier in the intermeeting period, financing conditions had been generally supportive of growth. Credit card balances and auto loan balances both appeared to grow solidly through February, according to banks’ data, con- tinuing their growth in the fourth quarter. Conditions for subprime credit card borrowers remained relatively tight but showed some signs of easing. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting was downgraded sig- nificantly from the January meeting forecast in response to news on the spread of the coronavirus at home and abroad and in response to a related substantial mark- down of the staff’s foreign economic outlook, along with recent financial market movements. Real GDP was forecast to decline and the unemployment rate to rise, on net, in the first half of this year. Given the downside risks and the elevated uncertainty about how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover, the staff provided two plausible economic sce- narios that spanned a range of possibilities. Importantly, the future performance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the virus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain it. In one scenario, economic ac- tivity started to rebound in the second half of this year. In a more adverse scenario, the economy entered reces- sion this year, with a recovery much slower to take hold and not materially under way until next year. In both scenarios, inflation was projected to weaken, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer energy prices. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was harming communities and disrupting economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and that global financial conditions had also been significantly af- fected. Participants expressed their deep concern for those whose health had been harmed and observed that the matter was, above all, a public health emergency. They commented that the measures—such as social dis- tancing—taken in response to the pandemic, while needed to contain the outbreak, would nevertheless take a toll on U.S. economic activity in the near term. Participants noted that available economic data showed that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing. Information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor mar- ket remained strong through February and that eco- nomic activity rose at a moderate rate. Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Although household spending had risen at a moderate pace, business fixed investment and exports had remained weak; further- more, in recent weeks the energy sector had come under stress due to the sharp drop in oil prices. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had been running below 2 percent. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expecta- tions had been little changed. However, market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined. All participants viewed the near-term U.S. economic outlook as having deteriorated sharply in recent weeks and as having become profoundly uncertain. Many par- ticipants had repeatedly downgraded their outlook of late in response to the rapidly evolving situation. All saw U.S. economic activity as likely to decline in the coming quarter and viewed downside risks to the economic out- look as having increased significantly. Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U.S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy. With regard to households’ behavior, participants noted that, although consumption spending had been a key driver of growth in economic activity through the first two months of this year, the pandemic was starting to impair consumer confidence and to exert an adverse ef- fect on household balance sheets. Participants reported that wide-ranging social-distancing measures were in op- eration or in prospect in their Districts. These measures—which included temporary closures of some physical locations, such as stores and restaurants, in which consumers purchased goods and services—would have the effect of reducing in-person transactions by households. Online shopping could substitute for some Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ of this activity but was unlikely to replace it fully. The housing market was likely to be disrupted by social dis- tancing, by financial uncertainty—including difficulties that households and businesses would face in meeting mortgage or rental payments—and by volatility in the market for MBS. Participants stressed the major down- side risk that the spread of the virus might intensify in those areas of the country currently less affected, thereby sidelining many more U.S. workers and further damping purchases by consumers. Participants expressed con- cern that households with low incomes had less of a sav- ings buffer with which to meet expenses during the in- terruption to economic activity. This situation made those households more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy and tended to magnify the reduction in aggre- gate demand associated with the nation’s response to the pandemic. Participants relayed reports on business sectors already badly hit by the response to the coronavirus outbreak. These sectors included those affected by the cancellation of many events, decisions by firms and households to reduce travel, government-mandated reductions in entry from abroad, and cutbacks on economic activity that re- quired in-person interaction. Firms directly affected in- cluded those connected to air travel, cruise lines, hotels, tourism services, sports and recreation, entertainment, hospitality, and restaurants. In the past week, pullbacks in purchases at retail stores, except for emergency buy- ing, had reportedly intensified significantly. In addition, the energy sector had come under stress because of re- cent large declines in oil prices. Many U.S. businesses had moved to telework arrangements; other businesses, however, could not readily shift to telework status or had limited telework technology. Participants observed that the coronavirus outbreak had inevitably hurt business confidence and that the expected length and severity of the restrictions on economic activity that involved in- person interaction would importantly affect the size of the response of investment spending to the situation. Participants expressed concern about the financial strain that many U.S. firms were under because of the loss of business and the extraordinary turbulence in financial markets. With regard to supply chains, many contacts had reported that some linkages in China had been re- stored and that they were able to draw on inventory sup- plies and on alternative supply chains; however, in some areas of the country, the construction industry had re- ported continuing disruptions to supply chains from China. Participants indicated that disruptions in the Eu- ropean economy and recent restrictions on travel from Europe to the United States would adversely affect the U.S. economy’s supply chains; so too, if it eventuated, would a large increase in U.S. worker unavailability be- cause of health reasons. Several participants emphasized concern about the capacity of the health care system in the current situation and welcomed measures taken to prevent the system’s overall capacity from being ex- ceeded. Participants noted that foreign economic growth for the first half of this year would be badly hit by the severe disruptions to economic activity abroad associated with the response to the coronavirus outbreak, including the recent measures taken in major European countries. However, some encouraging signs had come from China in recent weeks in the form of indications of increasing production and of more purchases of U.S. goods. With regard to the labor market, participants noted that some firms would likely need to cut employment imme- diately. Other firms, however, were looking for ways to retain employees during the period of reduced economic activity, in order to maintain capacity and be able to ramp up production once the public health crisis abated and demand rebounded. Measures that reportedly helped partially substitute for layoffs included the en- couragement by employers of voluntary leaves of ab- sence, non-replacement of departing workers, and in- creased reliance on the delivery of goods to customers in place of on-site purchases. Participants observed that businesses would be more likely to lay off workers on a major scale if the downturn in economic activity came to be perceived as likely to be protracted. Participants commented that workers most severely affected in the current situation were those who were ill, those with low incomes, those connected to the most hard-hit sectors, and those with irregular or contingent employment. They also noted that many workers had jobs that did not permit working from home. With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run objective before the coronavirus outbreak. They re- marked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed. Participants indicated, however, that imple- menting a more accommodative stance of monetary pol- icy at this meeting could be useful in helping offset these factors over time and in achieving the 2 percent inflation Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ objective over the longer run, by helping prevent cir- cumstances of persistent resource slack or a lasting de- cline in inflation expectations. Participants all agreed that the effects of the pandemic would weigh on economic activity in the near term and that the duration of this period of weakness was uncer- tain. They further concurred that the unpredictable ef- fects of the coronavirus outbreak were a source of major downside risks to the economic outlook. Participants raised several alternative scenarios with regard to the likely behavior of economic activity in the second half of this year. These scenarios differed from one another in the assumed length and severity of disruptions to eco- nomic activity. Several participants emphasized that the temporary nature of the shock to economic activity, the fact that the shock arose in the nonfinancial sector, and the healthy state of the U.S. banking system all implied that the current situation was not directly comparable with the previous decade’s financial crisis and it need not be followed by negative effects on economic activity as long-lasting as those associated with that crisis. Partici- pants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health care policy and fiscal policy, together with actions by the private sector, would be important in shaping the timing and speed of the U.S. economy’s return to normal con- ditions. Participants agreed that the Federal Reserve’s efforts to relieve stress in financial markets would help limit downside near-term outcomes by supporting credit flows to households and businesses, and that a more ac- commodative monetary policy stance would provide support to economic activity beyond the near term. Among the downside risks to this year’s U.S. economic outlook, participants prominently cited the possibility of the virus outbreak becoming more widespread than ex- pected. Such an event could lead to more wide-ranging temporary shutdowns, with adverse implications for the production of goods and services and for aggregate de- mand. With regard to financial developments over the inter- meeting period, participants noted that financial markets had exhibited extraordinary turbulence and stresses. Participants commented on the conditions of high vola- tility and illiquidity characterizing the markets for U.S. Treasury securities, especially off-the-run longer-term securities, and for agency MBS. Participants expressed concern about the disruptions to the functioning of these markets, especially in view of their status as cor- nerstones for the operation of the U.S. and global finan- cial systems and for the transmission of monetary policy. Participants observed that Federal Reserve operations in recent days had provided some relief with regard to the liquidity problems, but they noted that severe illiquidity continued to prevail in key securities markets. Many par- ticipants pointed to other dislocations in funding mar- kets that could impede financial intermediation to households and businesses. They highlighted the acute problems that many firms were facing in issuing CP and corporate bonds. Participants further noted that many businesses were tapping their backup credit lines with commercial banks. Participants also discussed the im- plications of recent financial market turbulence for money market funds and government bond funds and for debt issuance by state and local governments. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, most participants judged that it would be appropriate to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, to 0 to ¼ percent. In discussing the reasons for such a decision, these participants pointed to a likely decline in economic activity in the near term re- lated to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the extremely large degree of uncertainty regarding how long and severe such a decline in activity would be. In light of the sharply increased downside risks to the economic outlook posed by the global coronavirus outbreak, these participants noted that risk-management considerations pointed toward a forceful monetary policy response, with the majority favoring a 100 basis point cut that would bring the target range to its effective lower bound (ELB). With regard to monetary policy beyond this meeting, these participants judged that it would be ap- propriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent until policymakers were con- fident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. A few participants preferred a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and noted that such a decision would provide support to economic activity in the face of the antici- pated effects of the coronavirus. These participants pre- ferred to wait until there was greater assurance that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via financial markets and the supply of credit to households and busi- nesses was working effectively. This would allow fiscal and public health policy responses to the coronavirus outbreak to take hold and preserve the ability of the Committee to lower the target range, which was close to the ELB, in the event of a further deterioration in the economic outlook. In addition, these participants noted that a lowering of the target range by 100 basis points, coming so soon after the reduction of 50 basis points less than two weeks earlier, ran the risk of sending an overly negative signal about the economic outlook. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants also considered open market operations to purchase Treasury securities and agency MBS to support the smooth functioning of these securities markets, which in turn would help support the supply of credit to households and businesses. Participants generally agreed that, over the coming months, it would be appro- priate to increase the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and its hold- ings of agency MBS by at least $200 billion. Addition- ally, all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS would be rein- vested in agency MBS. Those Treasury and agency MBS purchases would be in addition to the recently expanded overnight and term repo operations conducted by the Desk. Participants stressed that it was important to communicate that the Committee would be prepared to increase the size of the securities purchases, as needed, on the basis of its close monitoring of market condi- tions. Some participants noted that it was important to stress in communications that the primary purpose of these asset purchases was to support the smooth func- tioning of Treasury and agency MBS markets rather than to provide further monetary policy accommodation by pushing down longer-term yields. A couple of partici- pants noted that because some of the purchases would be at longer maturities, the purchases could provide some accommodation by lowering longer-term yields. Participants discussed some of the possible communica- tions challenges associated with the Committee’s policy decisions at this meeting. Several participants noted that it would be important to communicate clearly and con- sistently about the rationale for the policy decisions taken at this meeting. Some participants remarked that the Committee’s policy actions regarding the target range and balance sheet could be interpreted as convey- ing negative news about the economic outlook. A few participants also remarked that lowering the target range to the ELB could increase the likelihood that some mar- ket interest rates would turn negative, or foster investor expectations of negative policy rates. Such expectations would run counter to participants’ previously expressed views that they would prefer to use other monetary pol- icy tools to provide further accommodation at the ELB. Additionally, several participants remarked that the pub- lic might view the ability of the Committee to provide further monetary policy accommodation as being lim- ited. However, some participants noted that the Com- mittee would still be able to provide monetary policy ac- commodation even after lowering the target range for the federal funds rate to the ELB. In particular, new forward guidance or balance sheet measures could be in- troduced. Participants also indicated strong support for related ac- tions taken by the Board of Governors to support the credit needs of households and businesses: • • • • to lower the primary credit rate by 150 basis points to ¼ percent and to allow depository in- stitutions to borrow from the discount window for periods as long as 90 days in order to encour- age more active use of the discount window on the part of depository institutions to meet unex- pected funding needs to encourage depository institutions to utilize in- traday credit to support the provision of liquidity to households and businesses and the smooth functioning of payment systems to encourage banks to use their capital and li- quidity buffers as they provide loans to house- holds and businesses affected by the coronavirus and undertake other supportive actions in a safe and sound manner to reduce reserve requirements to 0 percent in light of the shift to an ample-reserves regime and to support lending to households and businesses by depository institutions Participants also indicated support for enhancing, in co- ordination with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Eng- land, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, the provision of liquidity via the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements. The pricing on the standing U.S. dollar swap arrange- ments would be lowered by 25 basis points so that the new rate would be the U.S. dollar OIS rate plus 25 basis points, and U.S. dollars would be offered by foreign cen- tral banks with an 84-day maturity, in addition to the 1-week maturity operations. Following this discussion, the Chair indicated that these changes to the standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap line arrangements would be implemented consistent with the procedures described in the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. Participants generally commented that these additional measures would be helpful in supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. A few participants commented that stigma associated with the discount window may still be present or that further action, such as a relaunch of the Term Auction Facility, might be needed to encourage banks to take up additional fund- ing. A few other participants noted that discount win- Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ dow stigma should be less of a concern than it was pre- viously. In particular, these participants cited the lower- ing of the primary credit rate to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate, offering term funding for up to 90 days, and regulators encouraging banks to use the discount window to continue prudently lending to households and businesses. Several participants com- mented that banks should be discouraged from repur- chasing shares from, or paying dividends to, their equity holders in the wake of the proposed measures. Partici- pants generally noted that other measures to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, including those that relied on section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, might be needed in such an uncertain and rapidly evolving environment and that it would be prudent for the Federal Reserve to develop and remain prepared to implement such measures. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members noted that the coronavirus outbreak had harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States, and that global financial conditions had also been significantly af- fected. Available economic data showed that the U.S. economy came into this challenging period on a strong footing, with a strong labor market, a low unemploy- ment rate, and moderate growth in household spending, although business fixed investment and exports had re- mained weak. More recently, the energy sector had come under stress. On a 12-month basis, overall infla- tion and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had declined, and survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed. Members judged that the effects of the coronavirus would weigh on economic activity in the near term and would pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, almost all members agreed to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ¼ per- cent. These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confi- dent that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and price stability goals. One member pre- ferred to lower the target range by 50 basis points, to ½ to ¾ percent, at this meeting, in support of the actions taken to promote smooth market functioning and the flow of credit to households and businesses and in light of the anticipated effects of the coronavirus on eco- nomic activity and the economic outlook. In this partic- ipant’s view, a 50 basis point cut would preserve space for further cuts in the target range that could be imple- mented when market conditions had improved enough to ensure that the monetary policy transmission mecha- nism was functioning. Members noted that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information related to public health as well as global developments and muted inflation pres- sures, and that the Committee would use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. Members observed that, in determining the timing and size of fu- ture adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, the Committee would assess realized and expected eco- nomic conditions relative to its maximum-employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. They also agreed that those assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and readings on finan- cial and international developments. Members emphasized that the Federal Reserve was pre- pared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby pro- mote its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. To support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS that are central to the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Committee agreed to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $500 billion and its holdings of agency MBS by at least $200 billion. The Committee also agreed to reinvest all principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and MBS in agency MBS. In addition, members noted that the Desk had recently expanded its overnight and term repo operations. Members indicated that they would continue to closely monitor market conditions and that the Committee was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive: “Effective March 16, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee directs the Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Desk to increase over coming months the Sys- tem Open Market Account holdings of Treas- ury securities and agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) by at least $500 billion and by at least $200 billion, respectively. The Committee instructs the Desk to conduct these purchases at a pace appropriate to support the smooth functioning of markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS. The Committee also directs the Desk to con- tinue conducting term and overnight repur- chase agreement operations to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample and to sup- port the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. In addition, the Com- mittee directs the Desk to conduct overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.00 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities re- ceived during each calendar month in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 5:00 p.m.: “The coronavirus outbreak has harmed com- munities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States. Global financial conditions have also been sig- nificantly affected. Available economic data show that the U.S. economy came into this chal- lenging period on a strong footing. Information received since the Federal Open Market Com- mittee met in January indicates that the labor market remained strong through February and economic activity rose at a moderate rate. Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Although household spending rose at a moderate pace, business fixed invest- ment and exports remained weak. More re- cently, the energy sector has come under stress. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and infla- tion for items other than food and energy are Market-based running below 2 percent. measures of inflation compensation have de- clined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The effects of the corona- virus will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the economic outlook. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered re- cent events and is on track to achieve its maxi- mum employment and price stability goals. This action will help support economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation re- turning to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.

Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: Loretta J. Mester President Mester was fully supportive of all of the ac- tions taken to promote the smooth functioning of mar- kets and the flow of credit to households and businesses but voted against the FOMC action because she pre- ferred to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate to ½ to ¾ percent at this meeting. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 0 to ¼ percent, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 0.10 percent and voted unanimously to approve a 1½ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 0.25 percent, effective March 16, 2020. The Board also approved changes to allow Reserve Banks to extend primary credit loans for as long as 90 days and that could be prepaid or renewed on re- quest. In addition, the Board approved a reduction in reserve requirement ratios applicable to net transaction deposits above the exemption threshold to 0 percent ef- fective with the reserve maintenance period beginning on March 26, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, April 28– 29, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 2:40 p.m. on March 15, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on February 18, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 28–29, 2020. Videoconference meeting of March 2 A joint meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee and the Board of Governors was held by videoconfer- ence on March 2, 2020, at 7:30 p.m. to review develop- ments related to the outbreak of the coronavirus and dis- cuss steps that could be taken to provide support to the economy. As background for the Committee’s discus- sion, the staff reviewed recent developments in financial markets and provided an assessment of the evolving risks to the economic outlook. The SOMA manager noted that since mid-February when concerns about the spread of the coronavirus be- yond China had begun to intensify, global risk asset prices and sovereign yields had declined sharply. U.S. and global equity indexes were lower than at the time of the Committee’s meeting in January and implied equity market volatility had risen to levels not seen since 2015. The deterioration in risk sentiment had also been re- flected in a significant widening in U.S. and European corporate credit spreads and in peripheral European spreads. Amid the ongoing market volatility, issuance of investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds and of leveraged loans had generally dried up. Money markets had been resilient during the broader financial market volatility; pricing and trading conditions in offshore U.S. dollar funding markets had also been stable. Market functioning had remained orderly despite deterioration in liquidity conditions in Treasury, equity, and credit markets. Financial market participants’ views on the likely course of U.S. monetary policy had changed since the Commit- tee’s January meeting. The expected path of the federal funds rate embedded in futures prices had shifted down significantly over the period. Market commentary had interpreted Chair Powell’s February 28 statement as in- dicating the FOMC was prepared to lower the target range for the federal funds rate at or before the March meeting to support the achievement of the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Expec- tations for global monetary and fiscal easing had in- Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ creased, with some market commentary noting the pos- sibility of a coordinated effort across central banks or fiscal authorities. The SOMA manager noted that the situation remained highly fluid with key risks, including those associated with funding for corporate borrowers, operational vul- nerabilities associated with the transition to alternative work arrangements, and the potential for impaired mar- ket functioning. The staff then provided an update on current conditions and changes to the economic outlook since the FOMC’s January meeting. Available indicators for China sug- gested that the spread of the coronavirus had been asso- ciated with a collapse in economic activity during the first quarter, with spillovers to the global economy from the drop in Chinese demand and disruption of supply chains. Although there were some tentative signs that the coronavirus in China was being contained and pro- duction was beginning to resume, the outbreak of the virus in other foreign economies was weighing on con- sumer and business sentiment and depressing consump- tion in those countries. All told, foreign economic ac- tivity was expected to be significantly weaker during the first half of 2020 than the staff had anticipated at the time of the January FOMC meeting. The staff noted that the spread of the virus was at an earlier stage in the United States and its effects were not yet visible in monthly economic indicators, although there had been some softening in daily sentiment in- dexes and travel-related transactions. The outlook for real economic activity over the remainder of the year was highly uncertain and depended on the spread of the virus and the measures taken to contain it. Scenarios involv- ing a greater spread of the coronavirus and more severe social-distancing actions would be associated with a greater shutdown of production and disruption of sup- ply chains, larger negative effects on consumer and busi- ness sentiment, more significant increases in unemploy- ment, and worsening financial conditions. Reductions in demand, coupled with a stronger U.S. dollar and weaker commodity prices, were expected to put down- ward pressure on inflation, with the magnitude of the softening in core inflation depending on the severity of the situation. FOMC participants discussed the significant outbreaks of the coronavirus that had emerged recently in a few countries outside China and the likelihood that the virus would spread widely around the world, including in the United States. While the economic outlook at the time of the Committee’s January meeting had been favorable, the potential spread of the virus and the measures needed to protect communities from it represented a material downside risk to the U.S. economy. A forceful monetary policy action could provide a clear signal to the public that policymakers recognized the potential eco- nomic significance of the situation and were willing to move decisively to support the achievement of the Com- mittee’s dual mandate goals and counter the recent tight- ening of financial conditions. Although a reduction in the policy rate would not slow the spread of infection or remedy broken supply chains, it could help shore up the confidence of households, businesses, and financial mar- kets; ease financial strains of consumers and firms; and provide meaningful support to the economy in the face of a large shock to demand. Accordingly, participants supported a reduction of 50 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate. On March 3, 2020, the Committee completed the vote to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: “Effective March 4, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1 to 1¼ percent. In light of recent and ex- pected increases in the Federal Reserve’s non- reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to con- tinue conducting term and overnight repur- chase agreement operations at least through April 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp in- creases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation. In ad- dition, the Committee directs the Desk to con- duct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with matur- ities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trad- ing conventions) at an offering rate of 1.00 per- cent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for Minutes of the Meeting of March 15, 2020Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities received during each calendar month. Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be rein- vested in agency mortgage-backed securities. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” ing risks to economic activity. In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Fed- eral Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by ½ percentage point, to 1 to 1¼ percent. The Committee is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 to 1¼ per- cent, the Board of Governors completed on March 3, 2020, unanimous votes to lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.10 percent and to approve a ½ percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective March 4, 2020.

Lee Smith, Research and Policy Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. Fi- nancial conditions had shown notable improvement over recent weeks. Equity price indexes were up sub- stantially from the lows of late March, safe-haven de- mands for the dollar had receded, and measures of real- ized and implied volatility across markets had dimin- ished. Market participants pointed to swift and forceful actions taken by the Federal Reserve, coupled with strong fiscal measures, and some indications of a slowing in the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in major economies as factors contributing to these develop- ments. That said, market participants remained very uncertain about the economic outlook, and contacts highlighted an array of remaining risks, including those in corporate credit markets, emerging markets, and mortgage mar- kets. In corporate credit markets, concerns about po- tential defaults were rising, and ratings agencies had put on negative watch or downgraded many issuers. In emerging markets, the steep decline in commodity prices was exacerbating financial pressures for some emerging market economies (EMEs), which were also facing strains arising from capital outflows and a reduction in trade activity. And in mortgage markets, the likely in- crease in mortgage delinquencies associated with for- bearance polices and an eventual rise in defaults were sources of concern for bank and nonbank lenders. Open Market Desk surveys suggested that market par- ticipants anticipated a sharp near-term decline in eco- nomic activity, followed by some recovery later this year. Against this backdrop, market participants generally ex- pected the target range for the federal funds rate to re- main at the effective lower bound for the next couple of years. Respondents to Desk surveys attached almost no probability to the FOMC implementing negative policy rates. Some survey respondents indicated that they ex- pected modifications to the Committee’s forward guid- ance, but not at the current meeting. The manager then reviewed recent open market opera- tions. Since mid-March, at the direction of the FOMC, the Desk had purchased very large quantities of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in order to support the smooth functioning of these critical mar- kets. The Desk evaluated a broad array of indicators to assess market functioning. These indicators suggested considerable improvement in market functioning, and the Desk gradually scaled back the pace of purchases ac- cordingly. Market participants anticipated that the pace of purchases would slow after the June meeting, but they expected that outright securities holdings in the SOMA portfolio would continue to expand at least through the end of the year. The SOMA manager expected that, if Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ conditions continued to improve, the pace of purchases could be reduced somewhat further; however, consistent with the directive, the Desk was prepared to increase purchases as needed should market functioning worsen. Conditions in money markets had improved over recent weeks. The intense strains across a range of short-term funding markets that emerged in March had subsided. The expansion of Federal Reserve repurchase agreement (repo) operations, the enhancement and expansion of funding available through the discount window and swap lines, and the funding provided through the Pri- mary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (MMLF), and the Com- mercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) were likely im- portant in relieving pressures across a range of short- term funding markets. The manager noted that, despite these improvements, rates in some term funding mar- kets remained elevated, although forward measures sug- gested the upward pressure on these rates might ease in coming weeks. With conditions in short-term funding markets having improved substantially and with repo operations no longer needed to maintain ample reserve levels, the manager noted that it might be appropriate to position the Federal Reserve’s repurchase operations in a backstop role. For example, the minimum bid rate in repo operations could be increased somewhat relative to the level of the interest rate on excess reserves (the IOER rate). Later in the intermeeting period, short-term interest rates drifted lower and settled at near-zero levels. Al- though rates appeared stable, the manager suggested that circumstances could arise in which temporarily raising the per-counterparty limit on the overnight reverse repo operation would support policy implementation. The manager also noted that some market participants antic- ipated that the Federal Reserve might increase the IOER rate in order to move the federal funds rate closer to the middle of the target range and to address market func- tioning issues that could arise over time with overnight rates at very low levels. However, there appeared to be limited risk that the federal funds rate would move be- low the target range, as the Federal Home Loan Banks— the dominant lenders in the federal funds market—can earn a zero rate on balances maintained in their account at the Federal Reserve. Moreover, there were few signs to date that the low level of overnight funding rates had adversely affected market functioning, and trading vol- umes remained robust. The SOMA manager noted that the staff would continue to monitor developments. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur an- nually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures taken to protect public health were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad. The available information for the April 28–29 meeting indicated that U.S. labor market conditions deteriorated substantially in March and April, and real gross domestic product (GDP) declined sharply in the first quarter of the year. In addition, a variety of economic indicators were al- ready pointing toward an extraordinary contraction in GDP in the second quarter. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent in February. Job losses surged in March, even though the drop in to- tal nonfarm payroll employment reflected only those changes that had occurred through the mid-month ref- erence period of the establishment survey. In addition, the unemployment rate jumped to 4.4 percent in March, and the labor force participation rate decreased notably. After economic shutdowns started to occur on a wide- spread basis, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits skyrocketed in the second half of March through the first half of April, a development that pointed to substantial job losses in April. Nominal wage growth remained moderate, as average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in March. Total PCE price inflation and core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, both increased 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in Feb- ruary. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 3 of Dallas was 2.0 percent in February. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and the core CPI increased 2.1 percent over the same period. The total CPI rose less than the core CPI mostly because of substantial declines in con- sumer energy prices, which were reflecting significantly lower crude oil prices. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. The University of Michigan Sur- veys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in April, and the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con- sumer Expectations edged down in March; both measures remained in their recent ranges. Real PCE declined steeply in the first quarter of the year. The components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE, along with the sales of light motor vehi- cles, fell substantially in March, reflecting the effects of the widespread economic shutdowns. Moreover, the consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan and the Conference Board surveys deteriorated substan- tially over March and April. Real disposable personal income was about flat in the first quarter, so the personal saving rate moved up notably with the decline in spend- ing. In contrast to other sectors of the economy, real resi- dential investment expanded strongly in the first quarter as a whole, although housing-sector activity had started to slow dramatically late in the quarter. Starts and build- ing permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, tumbled in March. In addi- tion, sales of both new and existing homes contracted sharply in March, and survey measures of builders’ sen- timent plunged in April. Real business fixed investment slumped in the first quar- ter following moderate declines over the previous three quarters. Spending for business equipment fell consid- erably in the first quarter, led by a sharp decrease in pur- chases of transportation equipment. Business invest- ment in nonresidential structures also dropped notably. The coronavirus outbreak and the effects on economic activity of measures to contain it, together with the as- sociated elevated level of uncertainty, were likely re- flected in recent downbeat readings on business senti- ment in national and regional surveys and appeared to weigh heavily on business investment. In addition, the effects of substantial further declines in crude oil prices were being seen in the falling number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through late April, an indi- cator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector. Total industrial production fell precipitously in March, as the coronavirus outbreak led many factories to close late in the month. The decline in manufacturing output was led by a pullback in the production of motor vehi- cles and related parts. Output in the mining sector— which includes crude oil extraction—also decreased sig- nificantly in the wake of the recent declines in crude oil prices. Total real government purchases only edged up in the first quarter, led by a modest increase in federal pur- chases. State and local purchases were about flat, reflect- ing the effects of public school closures beginning in mid-March. Real exports declined sharply in the first quarter. How- ever, imports declined at a much faster rate so that net exports made a sizable positive contribution to GDP growth. Much of the quarterly decline in trade volumes reflected a sharp drop in March due to weak demand globally and disruptions related to the coronavirus out- break. The fall in exports was concentrated in services, particularly those parts of the sector held down by travel restrictions. Foreign economic activity fell sharply in the first quarter of the year amid widespread mandatory business shut- downs and strict social-distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. In China, where lockdowns were first implemented, real GDP contracted sharply in the first quarter, and Canada, Korea, and Sin- gapore also saw substantial declines. Monthly indicators suggested that activity also plummeted in March and April in many other economies, particularly in the euro area and the United Kingdom, which both saw purchas- ing managers indexes fall to record-low levels. Many foreign governments announced large fiscal packages to address the sudden loss of income by firms and house- holds. Many foreign central banks cut policy rates, initi- ated or enhanced credit facilities, relaxed capital require- ments for financial institutions, and ramped up asset purchase programs to alleviate liquidity concerns in for- eign capital markets. Foreign inflation fell steeply, re- flecting large drops in energy prices related to plunging oil prices, while core inflation pressures generally re- mained muted. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Staff Review of the Financial Situation In the middle part of March, financial markets experi- enced record declines in the prices of risky assets, wide- spread illiquidity, and elevated volatility, as uncertainty regarding the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the global economy jumped. However, following the an- nouncement and subsequent launching of a number of Federal Reserve emergency liquidity programs, the pas- sage of the Cares Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco- nomic Security Act), and early signs of a decline in out- break intensity in the United States and many major for- eign economies, the extreme volatility and illiquidity sub- sided and prices of most risky assets increased notably. Over the intermeeting period, on net, the S&P 500 index rose, option-implied volatility fell, and Treasury yields declined, while corporate bond spreads widened some- what. Financing conditions for businesses, households, and state and local governments were strained over the intermeeting period. However, the Federal Reserve’s announcements and start-ups of emergency liquidity fa- cilities appeared to improve conditions in many of these markets. These facilities were established with the ap- proval of the Secretary of the Treasury under the author- ity of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and were designed to support the flow of credit to businesses, households, and state and local governments. Treasury markets experienced extreme volatility in mid- March, and market liquidity became substantially im- paired as investors sold large volumes of medium- and long-term Treasury securities. Following a period of ex- traordinarily rapid purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS by the Federal Reserve, Treasury market li- quidity gradually improved through the remainder of the intermeeting period, and Treasury yields became less volatile. Although market depth remained exceptionally low and bid-ask spreads for off-the-run securities and long-term on-the-run securities remained elevated, bid- ask spreads for short-term on-the-run securities fell close to levels seen earlier in the year. Yields on nominal Treasury securities declined across the maturity spec- trum, with the 10- and 30-year yields ending the period near all-time lows. A straight read of market quotes sug- gested that the expected federal funds rate would remain under 25 basis points through 2022. Measures of infla- tion compensation based on Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities (TIPS) ended the period higher, on net, but were still low by historical standards. Inflation compensation fell sharply in the first half of March but subsequently recovered, as overall financial conditions and TIPS liquidity improved. The market for agency MBS also experienced substantial stresses in mid-March, and agency MBS spreads to Treasury yields widened and were volatile. However, market conditions for agency MBS improved significantly in the second half of March, supported by the Federal Reserve’s additional purchases of these securities. Stock price indexes were exceptionally volatile early in the intermeeting period, and one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index reached a record high. Equity market volatility moved down substantially over the remainder of the intermeeting period but remained elevated, and equity prices more than retraced their ear- lier declines to end the intermeeting period notably higher. Broad stock price index increases over the inter- meeting period were led by the energy, consumer discre- tionary, basic materials, and health-care sectors. Broad equity price indexes remained, however, markedly below peaks registered earlier this year. Corporate bond spreads over comparable-maturity Treasury yields wid- ened sharply in the beginning of the intermeeting period, and they subsequently retraced most of their increases to end up only somewhat higher on net. Corporate bond spreads at the end of the intermeeting period still stood significantly above their levels in January. In short-term funding markets, strains intensified in mid-March. Spreads of yields of term money market in- struments over comparable-maturity overnight index swap rates increased sharply, and issuance of unsecured commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit, and short-term municipal debt declined substantially and shifted to very short maturities. Institutional prime money market funds (MMFs) experienced heavy re- demptions and reportedly faced difficulties selling assets amid impaired secondary-market liquidity. The an- nouncements and start-ups of several Federal Reserve emergency liquidity facilities in the second half of March helped stabilize short-term funding markets, and, by the end of the intermeeting period, spreads had narrowed across the board. Repo rates were elevated in mid- March but normalized following the very large inflows of funds into government MMFs, the expansion of the Federal Reserve’s repo operations, and the announce- ment of the PDCF. The effective federal funds rate was at the top of the target range for a few days following the March FOMC meeting and, after declining in the second half of March, stayed at around 5 basis points for most of April. Early in the period, cascading shutdowns in many coun- tries weighed heavily on risk sentiment abroad. Many foreign financial markets experienced severe illiquidity and substantial volatility, and foreign equity indexes _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 5 posted large declines. However, extraordinary monetary and fiscal policy actions in the United States and abroad helped improve market sentiment, and most major for- eign equity indexes subsequently rebounded notably. That said, compared with early this year, foreign equity indexes stayed sharply lower, and option-implied equity volatility abroad remained elevated. Advanced-econ- omy sovereign yields were also volatile, but most sover- eign yields ended the period somewhat lower. By the end of the intermeeting period, policy rates in most ma- jor advanced foreign economies (AFEs) were at or near their effective lower bounds. In mid-March, Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) spreads widened sharply, and capital outflows from EMEs reached record levels. As global sentiment improved somewhat, those capital outflows slowed and EMBI spreads partially retraced earlier increases. Strong demand for dollars amid flight to safety globally, together with disruptions in U.S. short-term funding markets, caused severe strains in funding markets for dollars abroad, especially early in the intermeeting pe- riod. The premiums paid by investors to borrow dollars using the foreign exchange swap market over the costs of directly borrowing dollars widened sharply as the end of the first quarter approached. FOMC actions, includ- ing several changes to the standing central bank liquidity swap lines and a temporary expansion in the number of central bank counterparties, as well as the announce- ment of the FIMA (Foreign and International Monetary Authorities) Repo Facility, notably improved conditions in the foreign exchange swap market. Nonetheless, con- ditions in this market remained strained. Over the period, the staff’s broad dollar index increased, with the dollar appreciating modestly against AFE cur- rencies and notably against EME currencies. Currencies of vulnerable commodity exporters, such as Mexico and Brazil, depreciated sharply. At the end of the intermeet- ing period, the broad dollar index remained significantly higher than at the beginning of the year. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses were strained in March, particularly for lower-rated firms and small businesses. Federal Reserve announcements of fa- cilities to support the flow of credit to businesses, house- holds, and state and local governments appeared to im- prove financing conditions in many markets, although conditions had yet to normalize. Issuance of specula- tive-grade bonds and leveraged loans was extremely low in March but resumed, at a slow pace, in April. Invest- ment-grade issuance, while relatively slow in early March, was robust following the Federal Reserve’s an- nouncements in late March of the Primary Market Cor- porate Credit Facility and the Secondary Market Corpo- rate Credit Facility. Conditions in the market for corpo- rate bonds and loans improved further in response to the Federal Reserve’s announcement in April that it would expand these facilities to include firms that had been recently downgraded to just below investment- grade status. Commercial and industrial (C&I) lending conditions were somewhat tight. Although C&I loans increased strongly, this increase was largely driven by firms draw- ing down existing lines of credit; they reportedly did so to shore up liquidity for precautionary motives and to meet funding needs. In the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported having tightened their C&I lending standards and terms for firms of all sizes. Credit quality and the earnings outlook of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated substantially, and market analysts forecast a large volume of downgrades of nonfinancial corporate bonds, including a substantial volume from triple-B to speculative grade. Credit conditions for small businesses were tight. Concerns about the finances of state and lo- cal governments contributed to a marked deterioration in credit conditions in the municipal bond market in March. Although strains lessened amid Federal Reserve announcements on emergency lending facilities to sup- port the flow of credit and liquidity to state and local governments—specifically, expansions to the MMLF and the CPFF and the establishment of the Municipal Liquidity Facility—spreads remained high and issuance subdued at the end of the intermeeting period. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) were strained. Non-agency commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS) issuance shut down, although secondary-market spreads narrowed following the ex- tension of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facil- ity (TALF) to include non-agency CMBS as eligible col- lateral. Meanwhile, agency CMBS issuance continued, supported by the Federal Reserve’s purchases of these securities. Most April SLOOS respondents reported having tightened lending standards for CRE loans. CRE loans on banks’ books increased in the second half of March, in part because banks were unable to securitize some nonresidential loans. Financing conditions in residential mortgage markets were tight for low-rated borrowers and other borrowers who rely on nonconforming mortgages. Many mortgage originators and warehouse lenders announced tighter Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ underwriting standards on new originations. Despite a considerable widening of the spread between the pri- mary mortgage rate and MBS yields, primary mortgage interest rates were low by historical standards, and avail- able indicators suggested that refinancing activity re- mained elevated. The volume of mortgage rate locks for home-purchase loans dropped materially in early April, reflecting in part declines in homebuyer demand and dis- ruptions in the home search and purchase process. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets tight- ened somewhat on net. Spreads on consumer asset- backed securities jumped in mid-March, and primary- market issuance came to a halt. However, in response to the announcement of the TALF and to diminished broader financial market uncertainty, spreads retraced most of their increase in the early part of the period, and primary-market issuance resumed. Though banks in the April SLOOS reported tightening standards on new consumer loans, respondents also experienced weaker demand for all consumer loan types. Auto loan interest rates dropped sharply in early April as manufacturers in- troduced attractive financing programs to boost sales. The staff assessed the stability of the financial system during the coronavirus outbreak. The banking sector, including the large banks, was resilient coming into this period. Banks were able to meet surging demand for draws on credit lines while also building loan loss re- serves to absorb higher expected defaults. In other parts of the financial system, however, some notable vulnera- bilities that had been identified in previous financial sta- bility assessments exacerbated financial strains. In March, institutional prime MMFs and other institutions relying on unstable funding sources faced significant stress, a situation that put in jeopardy the orderly func- tioning of some financial markets. Federal Reserve ac- tions to enhance the liquidity and functioning of key markets reduced these stresses notably. Open-end mu- tual funds that invest in corporate bonds and loans— institutions that typically face a timing mismatch be- tween investors’ ability to redeem shares and the funds’ ability to sell assets—experienced heavy outflows and li- quidity strains in mid-March. Redemptions later eased, however, amid the general improvement in financial markets. Business debt, which appeared to be high com- pared with fundamentals before the coronavirus out- break, seemed poised to rise further as businesses bor- rowed to maintain their capacity to restart operations. Values of CRE faced the risk of large declines in re- sponse to the coronavirus outbreak, although updated readings were not yet available. The staff provided a pre- liminary reading on potential emerging risks to financial stability in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. This reading highlighted possible vulnerabilities in mort- gage servicers, insurance companies, and large, highly leveraged financial intermediaries. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for the April FOMC meeting was downgraded no- tably from the March meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the coronavirus and the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad. U.S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year. The substantial fiscal policy measures and mone- tary policy support that had been put in place were ex- pected to help mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions and help boost the recovery. The staff noted that, importantly, the future perfor- mance of the economy would depend on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures under- taken to contain it. Under the staff’s baseline assump- tions that the current restrictions on social interactions and business operations would ease gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appreciably and the unem- ployment rate to decline considerably in the second half of the year, although a complete recovery was not ex- pected by year-end. Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deterioration in resource utilization and sizable expected declines in consumer en- ergy prices. Under the baseline assumptions, economic conditions were projected to continue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. The staff observed that uncertainty regarding the eco- nomic effects of the coronavirus outbreak was extremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the U.S. economy in response to past economic shocks pro- vided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve over coming quarters. In light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks as- sociated with the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak, how much the economy would weaken, and how long it would take to recover, the staff judged that a more pes- simistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast. In this scenario, a second wave of the corona- virus outbreak, with another round of strict restrictions on social interactions and business operations, was as- sumed to begin around year-end, inducing a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and re- newed downward pressure on inflation next year. Com- pared with the baseline, the disruption to economic ac- tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 7 with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemploy- ment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projec- tion. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The vi- rus and the measures taken to protect public health were inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad had significantly affected financial conditions and had im- paired the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses. Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis would con- tinue to weigh heavily on economic activity, employ- ment, and inflation in the near term and would pose con- siderable risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. Participants assessed that the second quarter would likely see overall economic activity decline at an unprecedented rate. Participants relayed information from their Districts that the burdens of the present crisis would fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable and financially constrained households in the economy. Participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal programs were delivering valuable direct financial aid to house- holds, businesses, and communities that would provide some relief during the economic shutdown. In addition, economic activity was being supported by actions taken by the Federal Reserve, including lending facilities cre- ated under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, some of which included capital allocated by the U.S. Treasury. These programs had helped maintain the flow of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, while supporting the smooth functioning of financial markets. Regarding the economic activity of households, partici- pants noted that the pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease were having severely adverse ef- fects on aggregate household spending and consumer confidence. Participants reported that consumer spend- ing had plummeted across all parts of the country and in most categories of spending, with especially sharp de- clines in expenditures for categories that had been most affected by social distancing, such as hotel, fuel, air travel, restaurant, theater, and other retail products and services. Participants noted that even after government- imposed social-distancing restrictions came to an end, consumer spending in these categories likely would not return quickly to more normal levels. Survey-based measures of consumer confidence also plunged, a devel- opment that participants and District contacts attributed to households’ concerns regarding the risk of job loss or difficulty in meeting financial obligations. Participants noted that some households experiencing job losses may not immediately face lower total income because of the support from recently enacted fiscal programs. Even in such cases, however, participants observed that house- hold spending would likely be held down by a decrease in confidence and an increase in precautionary saving. Participants noted that business activity and investment spending had also fallen dramatically since the previous meeting as a result of efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Manufacturing output declined sharply in March and was expected by participants to drop even more rapidly in April. In all Districts, some businesses had been forced to close temporarily because of social distancing restrictions. Businesses that were able to re- main open to some degree were also substantially af- fected by the pandemic, with many experiencing either substantial drops in new orders and sales or supply chain disruptions. There were widespread reports from Dis- trict contacts of firms reducing their payrolls and curtail- ing plans for investment spending. Some industries were especially hard hit, including airlines, cruise ships, restau- rants, and tourism. Participants reported that many firms were seeking loans, payment deferrals, or grants to help address critical financial obligations and that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was providing val- uable assistance to small businesses in this respect. Par- ticipants also noted the disproportionate burdens or par- ticular challenges being faced by small businesses; these challenges included lower cash buffers, fewer financing options, and, more recently, tighter lending standards. Participants expressed concerns that a large number of small businesses may not be able to endure a shock that had long-lasting financial effects. Participants were fur- ther concerned that even after social-distancing require- ments were eased, some business models may no longer be economically viable, which could occur, for example, if consumers voluntarily continued to avoid participating in particular forms of economic activity. In addition, participants expressed concern that the possibility of secondary outbreaks of the virus may cause businesses for some time to be reluctant to engage in new projects, rehire workers, or make new capital expenditures. Participants observed that conditions in the energy sec- tor had become especially difficult. A sharp reduction Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ in global demand for petroleum had led to unused sup- ply that was overwhelming storage capacity, resulting in a plunge in oil prices. Some participants expressed con- cern that low energy prices, if they were to persist, had the potential to create a wave of bankruptcies in the en- ergy sector. In addition, the agricultural sector was un- der severe stress due to falling prices for some farm commodities and pandemic-related disruptions, such as the closing of some food processing plants. With regard to the labor market, participants noted that incoming data confirmed that an extreme decline in em- ployment was under way. Nationally, initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had totaled more than 25 million from mid-March to the time of the meeting, and participants expected that the unemployment rate would soon reach the highest levels of the post–World War II period. District contacts reported that a signifi- cant portion of workers had been able to switch to work- ing remotely. Although many employers were trying to keep workers on their payrolls, over time, as conditions persisted, there had begun to be widespread furloughs and layoffs. Participants were concerned that temporary layoffs could become permanent, and that workers who lose employment could face a loss of job-specific skills or may become discouraged and exit the labor force. Participants were additionally concerned that employees who were on low incomes would be the most severely affected by job cuts because they were employed in the industries most affected by the response to the outbreak or because their jobs were not amenable to being carried out remotely. With regard to inflation, participants noted that it had been running below the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run objective before the coronavirus outbreak. While the pandemic had created some supply constraints, which had generated upward pressure on the prices of some goods, the pandemic had also reduced demand, which had exerted downward pressure on prices. The overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as dis- inflationary. In addition, a stronger dollar and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation, and market-based measures of inflation com- pensation remained very low. Participants observed that the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed but that the accommodative stance of monetary policy would be helpful in achieving the 2 percent inflation ob- jective over the longer run. Participants noted that recently enacted fiscal programs were crucial for limiting the severity of the economic downturn. In particular, the Cares Act and other legis- lation, which represented more than $2 trillion in federal spending in total, had provided direct help to house- holds, businesses, and communities. For example, the PPP was providing a financial lifeline to small busi- nesses, the expansion of unemployment benefits was helping restore lost income for laid-off workers, and the Treasury had provided a necessary financial backstop to many Federal Reserve lending facilities. Participants acknowledged that even greater fiscal support may be necessary if the economic downturn persists. Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the eco- nomic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to eco- nomic activity in the medium term. Participants dis- cussed several alternative scenarios with regard to the behavior of economic activity in the medium term that all seemed about equally likely. These scenarios differed in the assumed length of the pandemic and the conse- quent economic disruptions. On the one hand, a num- ber of participants judged that there was a substantial likelihood of additional waves of outbreak in the near or medium term. In such scenarios, it was believed likely that there would be further economic disruptions, in- cluding additional periods of mandatory social distanc- ing, greater supply chain dislocations, and a substantial number of business closures and loss of income; in total, such developments could lead to a protracted period of severely reduced economic activity. On the other hand, economic activity could recover more quickly if the pan- demic subsided enough for households and businesses to become sufficiently confident to relax or modify so- cial-distancing behaviors over the next several months. Beyond these considerations, participants noted the risk that foreign economies, particularly EMEs, could come under extreme pressure as a result of the pandemic and that this strain could spill over to and hamper U.S. eco- nomic activity. Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health-care policy and fiscal policy, to- gether with actions by the private sector, would be im- portant in shaping the timing and speed of the U.S. economy’s return to more normal conditions. In addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve were essential in helping reduce downside risks to the economic outlook. Participants also noted several risks to long-term eco- nomic performance that were posed by the pandemic. One of these risks was that workers who lose employ- ment as a result of the pandemic may experience a loss of skills, lose access to adequate childcare or eldercare, _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 9 or become discouraged and exit the labor force. The longer-term behavior of firms could be affected as well—for instance, if necessary but costly transmission- mitigation strategies lowered firms’ productivity; if busi- ness investment shifted down permanently; if many firms need to adjust their business models in the after- math of the pandemic; or if business closures, particu- larly those of small firms, became widespread. A few participants noted that higher levels of government in- debtedness, which would be exacerbated by fiscal ex- penditures that were necessary to combat the economic effects of the pandemic, could put downward pressure on growth in aggregate potential output. Regarding developments in financial markets, partici- pants agreed that ongoing actions by the Federal Reserve had been instrumental in easing strains in some essential financial markets and supporting the flow of credit. These actions included large-scale purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, measures to reduce strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets, and the launch of programs to support the flow of credit in the economy for households, businesses of all sizes, and state and lo- cal governments. Banks had entered the crisis well cap- italized and had been able to provide necessary credit to businesses and households. A number of participants commented on potential risks to financial stability. Participants were concerned that banks could come under greater stress, particularly if ad- verse scenarios for the spread of the pandemic and eco- nomic activity were realized, and so this sector should be monitored carefully. Participants saw risks to banks and some other financial institutions as exacerbated by high levels of indebtedness among nonfinancial corporations that prevailed before the pandemic; this indebtedness in- creased these firms’ risk of insolvency. The upcoming financial stress tests for banks were seen as important for measuring the ability of large banks to withstand fu- ture downside scenarios. A number of participants em- phasized that regulators should encourage banks to pre- pare for possible downside scenarios by further limiting payouts to shareholders, thereby preserving loss-absorb- ing capital. Indeed, historical loss models might under- state losses in this context. A few participants stressed that the activities of some nonbank financial institutions presented vulnerabilities to the financial system that could worsen in the event of a protracted economic downturn and that these institutions and activities should be monitored closely. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants noted that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term, all participants judged that it would be appropriate to main- tain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Keeping the target range at the effective lower bound, after quickly reducing it by 150 basis points in March, would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and price stability goals. Participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Participants also assessed that it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury secu- rities and agency residential-mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning. These open market pur- chases would continue to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby foster the effec- tive transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk would continue to of- fer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Par- ticipants noted that it was important to continue to mon- itor market conditions closely and that the Committee was prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate to support smooth functioning in the markets for these securities. Participants also commented that the multiple lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and, in some cases, involving capital allocated by the Treasury were supporting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments. In this way, these emergency lending facilities were intended to help sup- port the economy until pandemic-related credit market disruptions had abated. Several participants commented further that it would be important for the Federal Re- serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan- cial market functioning and credit conditions. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ While participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, they noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions. Some participants commented that the Committee could make its forward guidance for the path for the federal funds rate more explicit. For example, the Committee could adopt outcome-based forward guidance that would specify macroeconomic out- comes—such as a certain level of the unemployment rate or of the inflation rate—that must be achieved be- fore the Committee would consider raising the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee could also consider date-based forward guidance that would indicate that the target range could be raised only after a specified amount of time had elapsed. These partici- pants noted that such explicit forms of forward guidance could help ensure that the public’s expectations regard- ing the future conduct of monetary policy continued to reflect the Committee’s intentions. Several participants observed that the completion, most likely later this year, of the monetary policy framework review, together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the review, would help further clarify the Committee’s in- tentions with respect to its future monetary policy ac- tions. Several participants also remarked that the Com- mittee may need to provide further clarity regarding its intentions for purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS; these participants noted that, without fur- ther communication on this matter, uncertainty about the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases could increase over time. Several participants remarked that a program of ongoing Treasury securities purchases could be used in the future to keep longer-term yields low. A few participants also noted that the balance sheet could be used to reinforce the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate through Federal Reserve purchases of Treasury securi- ties on a scale necessary to keep Treasury yields at short- to medium-term maturities capped at specified levels for a period of time. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus- ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health were induc- ing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices. The disruptions to global economic activity had signifi- cantly affected financial conditions and impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Mem- bers agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Members further concurred that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the eco- nomic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, and would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determin- ing the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment ob- jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market condi- tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses, members agreed that it was appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to purchase Treasury secu- rities and agency RMBS and CMBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Members agreed that they would closely monitor market conditions and be prepared to adjust their plans as appropriate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of April 28–29, 2020Page 11 “Effective April 30, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities (CMBS) in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund- ing markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter- party limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. The disruptions to economic activity here and abroad have signifi- cantly affected financial conditions and have impaired the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considera- ble risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weath- ered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the Federal Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury securities and agency resi- dential and commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader fi- nancial conditions. In addition, the Open Mar- ket Desk will continue to offer large-scale over- night and term repurchase agreement opera- tions. The Committee will closely monitor mar- ket conditions and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective April 30, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 9–10, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:10 a.m. on April 29, 2020. Notation Votes To address intensifying strains in global financial mar- kets early in the intermeeting period, the Committee unanimously approved the following measures to help maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses: • By notation vote concluded on March 19, the Com- mittee approved amendments to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (“Foreign Author- ization”) and to the Foreign Currency Directive (“Foreign Directive”).3 The Foreign Authorization amendments authorized the establishment of tem- porary U.S. dollar liquidity arrangements (swap lines). The Foreign Directive was amended to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to establish and maintain temporary dollar liquidity arrange- ments with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Banco Central do Brasil, the Danmarks National- bank (Denmark), the Bank of Korea, the Banco de Mexico, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Norges Bank (Norway), the Monetary Authority of Singapore, and the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden). These arrangements will be in place for at least six months. Like the Federal Reserve’s standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Euro- pean Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank, these temporary arrangements should help lessen heightened strains in global U.S. dollar funding mar- kets, thereby mitigating the effects of these strains on the supply of credit to U.S. households and busi- nesses. 3 Committee organizational documents are available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_au- thorizations.htm. • By notation vote concluded on March 23, the Com- mittee approved a statement indicating that the Fed- eral Reserve will continue to purchase Treasury se- curities and agency MBS in the amounts needed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions and that these purchases will include agency CMBS. In conjunction with approval of the statement, the Committee also authorized and di- rected the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with these planned purchases. Previously, the Com- mittee had announced that it would purchase at least $500 billion of Treasury securities and at least $200 billion of agency MBS. • By notation vote concluded on March 31, the Com- mittee amended the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations to authorize, and adopted a resolution to approve, the establishment of a tem- porary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility).3 The facility will be in place for at least six months and will allow FIMA account holders to temporarily ex- change their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. By providing foreign and international monetary au- thorities with an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market, the facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market. In addi- tion, the FIMA Repo Facility should—along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Re- serve has established with other central banks—help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets. By notation vote completed on April 7, 2020, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on March 15, 2020. _______________________ James A.

Injustice, prejudice, and the callous dis- regard for life had led to social unrest and a sense of des- pair. The Chair noted that it was incumbent upon the leaders of the Federal Reserve System to continue to communicate with force and clarity about the Federal Reserve’s core values, and to reaffirm its unflinching commitment to those values in pursuing the Federal Re- serve’s mandated goals. In that spirit, the Chair noted that he intended to offer the following remarks at the 5 Attended through the discussion of economic developments and the outlook. 6 Attended from the discussion of economic developments and the outlook through the end of Tuesday’s session. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ end of the postmeeting press conference. All partici- pants supported the statement affirming the Federal Re- serve’s core values and its commitment to do everything it can to foster racial equality as well as diversity and in- clusion both within the Federal Reserve System and in society more broadly. I want to acknowledge the tragic events that have again put a spotlight on the pain of racial injustice in this country. The Federal Reserve serves the entire nation. We operate in, and are part of, many of the communities across the country where Americans are grappling with and expressing themselves on issues of racial equality. I speak for my colleagues throughout the Fed- eral Reserve System when I say that there is no place at the Federal Reserve for racism, and there should be no place for it in our society. Everyone deserves the opportunity to partici- pate fully in our society and in our economy. These foundational principles guide us in all we do, from monetary policy to our focus on diver- sity and inclusion in our workplace, and to our work regulating and supervising banks to ensure fair access to credit around the country. We will take this opportunity to renew our steadfast commitment to these principles, making sure that we are playing our part. We understand that the work of the Federal Re- serve touches communities, families, and busi- nesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We are com- mitted to using our full range of tools to support the economy and to help assure that the recov- ery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible. Discussion of Forward Guidance, Asset Purchases, and Yield Curve Caps or Targets Participants discussed tools for conducting monetary policy when the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound (ELB). The discussion addressed two topics: (1) the roles of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchase programs in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals and (2) in light of the foreign and historical expe- rience with approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve, whether such approaches could be used to support forward guidance and complement asset purchase programs. The staff briefing on the first topic focused on outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate—which ties changes in the target range for the federal funds rate to the achievement of specified macroeconomic outcomes, such as reaching a given level of the unemployment rate or inflation—and asset purchase programs of the kind used during and fol- lowing the previous recession. The staff presented re- sults from model simulations that suggested that for- ward guidance and large-scale asset purchases can help support the labor market recovery and the return of in- flation to the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation goal. The simulations suggested that the Committee would have to maintain highly accommodative financial conditions for many years to quicken meaningfully the recovery from the current severe downturn. The brief- ing addressed factors that might alter the potency of for- ward guidance and asset purchase programs, along with a number of considerations for the design of these ac- tions. The staff cautioned that businesses and house- holds might not be as forward looking as assumed in the model simulations, which could reduce the effectiveness of policies that are predicated on influencing expecta- tions about the path of policy several years into the fu- ture. Alternatively, prompt and forceful policy actions by the Committee might help focus the public’s expec- tations around better outcomes or reduce perceived risks of worst-case scenarios, which could generate more im- mediate macroeconomic benefits than those featured in the staff analysis. The second staff briefing reviewed the yield caps or tar- gets (YCT) policies that the Federal Reserve followed during and after World War II and that the Bank of Ja- pan and the Reserve Bank of Australia are currently em- ploying. These three experiences illustrated different types of YCT policies: During World War II, the Fed- eral Reserve capped yields across the curve to keep Treasury borrowing costs low and stable; since 2016, the Bank of Japan has targeted the 10-year yield to continue to provide accommodation while limiting the potential for an excessive flattening of the yield curve; and, since March 2020, the Reserve Bank of Australia has targeted the three-year yield, a target that is intended to reinforce the bank’s forward guidance for its policy rate and to in- fluence funding rates across much of the Australian economy. The staff noted that these three experiences suggested that credible YCT policies can control govern- ment bond yields, pass through to private rates, and, in the absence of exit considerations, may not require large central bank purchases of government debt. But the staff also highlighted the potential for YCT policies to require the central bank to purchase very sizable Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ amounts of government debt under certain circum- stances—a potential that was realized in the U.S. experi- ence in the 1940s—and the possibility that, under YCT policies, monetary policy goals might come in conflict with public debt management goals, which could pose risks to the independence of the central bank. In their discussion of forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, participants agreed that the Committee has had extensive experience with these tools, that they were effective in the wake of the previous recession, that they have become key parts of the monetary policy toolkit, and that, as a result, they have important roles to play in supporting the attainment of the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Vari- ous participants noted that the economy is likely to need support from highly accommodative monetary policy for some time and that it will be important in coming months for the Committee to provide greater clarity re- garding the likely path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases. Participants generally indicated support for outcome-based forward guidance. A number of partici- pants spoke favorably of forward guidance tied to infla- tion outcomes that could possibly entail a modest tem- porary overshooting of the Committee’s longer-run in- flation goal but where inflation fluctuations would be centered on 2 percent over time. They saw this form of forward guidance as helping reinforce the credibility of the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and potentially preventing a premature withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation. A couple of partici- pants signaled a preference for forward guidance tied to the unemployment rate, noting that it would be more credible to focus on labor market outcomes that have been achieved in the recent past or that—given how high the unemployment rate currently is—such guidance would clearly signal a high degree of accommodation for an extended period. A few others suggested that calendar-based guidance—which specifies a date beyond which accommodation could start to be reduced—might be at least as effective as outcome-based guidance. They noted that calendar-based guidance had been very effec- tive when the Committee used it in 2011 and 2012 or that it would be very challenging to provide credible out- come-based guidance in light of the substantial uncer- tainty surrounding the current economic outlook. Re- gardless of the specific form of forward guidance, a cou- ple of participants expressed the concern that policies that effectively committed the Committee to maintain- ing very low interest rates for a long time could ulti- mately pose significant risks to financial stability. Participants agreed that asset purchase programs can promote accommodative financial conditions by putting downward pressure on term premiums and longer-term yields. Several participants remarked that declines in the neutral rate of interest and in term premiums over the past decade and prevailing low levels of longer-term yields would likely act as constraints on the effectiveness of asset purchases in the current environment and noted that these constraints were not as acute when the Com- mittee implemented such programs in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. These participants noted, how- ever, that large-scale asset purchases could still be bene- ficial under current circumstances by offsetting potential upward pressures on longer-term yields or by helping re- inforce the Committee’s commitment to maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions. A few par- ticipants questioned the desirability of large-scale asset purchases following the current purchases to support market functioning, noting that they likely would lead to a further considerable expansion of the Federal Re- serve’s balance sheet or have potentially adverse impli- cations for financial stability. In their discussion of the foreign and historical experi- ence with YCT policies and the potential role for such policies in the United States, nearly all participants indi- cated that they had many questions regarding the costs and benefits of such an approach. Among the three ep- isodes discussed in the staff presentation, participants generally saw the Australian experience as most relevant for current circumstances in the United States. None- theless, many participants remarked that, as long as the Committee’s forward guidance remained credible on its own, it was not clear that there would be a need for the Committee to reinforce its forward guidance with the adoption of a YCT policy. In addition, participants raised a number of concerns related to the implementa- tion of YCT policies, including how to maintain control of the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s bal- ance sheet, particularly as the time to exit from such pol- icies nears; how to combine YCT policies—which at least in the Australian case incorporate aspects of date- based forward guidance—with the types of outcome- based forward guidance that many participants favored; how to mitigate the risks that YCT policies pose to cen- tral bank independence; and how to assess the effects of these policies on financial market functioning and the size and composition of private-sector balance sheets. A number of participants commented on additional chal- lenges associated with YCT policies focused on the longer portion of the yield curve, including how these policies might interact with large-scale asset purchase Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ programs and the extent of additional accommodation they would provide in the current environment of very low interest rates. Some of these participants also noted that longer-term yields are importantly influenced by factors such as longer-run inflation expectations and the longer-run neutral real interest rate and that changes in these factors or difficulties in estimating them could re- sult in the central bank inadvertently setting yield caps or targets at inappropriate levels. A couple of participants remarked that an appropriately designed YCT policy that focused on the short-to-medium part of the yield curve could serve as a powerful commitment device for the Committee. These participants noted that, even if mar- ket participants currently expect the federal funds rate to remain at its ELB through the medium term, the intro- duction of an effective YCT policy could help prevent those expectations from changing prematurely—as hap- pened during the previous recovery—or that the size of a large-scale asset purchase program, which also poses risks to central bank independence, could be reduced by an effective YCT policy. All participants agreed that it would be useful for the staff to conduct further analysis of the design and implementation of YCT policies as well as of their likely economic and financial effects. A number of participants emphasized that, when as- sessing the potential roles that different monetary policy tools might play to support the attainment of the Com- mittee’s goals, it was important to think about how var- ious policy tools could be used in coordination as part of the Committee’s overall strategy to achieve its dual- mandate objectives. In addition, various participants noted that clear communications with the public are cen- tral to the efficacy of all policy tools and that, therefore, the Committee should complete its monetary policy framework review in the near term, including revising the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Pol- icy Strategy. Such a revised statement would communi- cate to the public how the Committee views its policy goals and provide additional context to the Committee’s policy actions. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Risk asset prices were buoyed by optimism about the potential for increased economic activity associated with reopenings as parts of the United States and other countries relaxed lockdown restrictions. That optimism was reinforced by high-frequency data suggesting a pickup in economic activity. Market partic- ipants also pointed to the suite of U.S. and global policy measures taken since mid-March as laying a foundation for the improvement in risk sentiment. Against this backdrop, staff analysis suggested that equity prices had been supported by expectations for a strong rebound in earnings next year, low risk-free rates and positive risk sentiment. Despite this improvement in risk sentiment, market participants expected weak overall growth in 2020, and elevated uncertainties in the outlook re- mained. The manager noted that prospects for adverse developments regarding the coronavirus (COVID-19) and the potential for financial strains to amplify reces- sionary dynamics, and geopolitical developments, in- cluding renewed U.S.–China tensions, presented near term risks to financial markets. Market participants were also attentive to the recent steepening in the Treasury yield curve and noted a range of uncertainties in the out- look for longer-term rates. Regarding expectations for monetary policy, respond- ents to the Open Market Trading Desk’s surveys sug- gested that most market participants did not anticipate policy changes at the June meeting. The target range for the federal funds rate was expected to remain at the ELB for at least the next couple of years, although many sur- vey respondents attached some probability to the target range increasing in 2022. Although the rates implied by federal funds futures contracts settling next year had fallen to slightly negative levels in May, survey respond- ents attached very little probability to the possibility of negative policy rates. The manager turned to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations. Credit facilities, some of which became op- erational over the period, generally experienced modest activity in light of broad improvements in credit market conditions. New usage across many funding operations and facilities had declined over the intermeeting period as conditions in funding markets improved. The man- ager noted that a significant proportion of amounts out- standing under U.S. dollar liquidity swaps and repur- chase agreements (repo) reflected term transactions ini- tiated during the period of funding market strains. In light of the improvement in funding market conditions, the manager noted that it might be appropriate to make a modest adjustment to the minimum bid rates on repo operations in the forthcoming calendar, which would ef- fectively position these operations in a backstop role. These adjustments were not expected to have any signif- icant effects in short-term funding markets. Finally, the manager discussed the near-term plans for purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS). Overall, functioning in the Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ markets for these securities had improved substantially. In light of these improvements, the Desk had gradually reduced the pace of purchases over the intermeeting pe- riod, to their current levels of $4 billion per day in Treas- ury securities and $4.5 billion per day in agency MBS. These purchase amounts were significantly lower than the peak pace in mid-March and roughly corresponded to monthly increases in SOMA holdings of approxi- mately $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in agency MBS. Continuing to increase holdings at this pace would likely help sustain the improvements in mar- ket functioning, and seemed to be roughly in line with market expectations for Treasury purchases, and toward the lower end of expectations for agency MBS pur- chases, net of reinvestments. In addition, principal pay- ments from agency debt and agency MBS held in the SOMA portfolio could continue to be reinvested in agency MBS. Weekly operations in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) would also be con- ducted. The Desk was prepared to increase the size or adjust the composition of Treasury, agency MBS and agency CMBS purchases as needed to sustain smooth market functioning in the markets for these securities. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread were severely disrupting economic activity in the United States and abroad. The available information for the June 9–10 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) would likely post a historically large decline in the second quarter. Labor market conditions improved in May, but these im- provements were modest relative to the substantial de- terioration seen over the previous two months. Con- sumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month per- centage change in the price index for personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE), slowed notably through April, reflecting the effects of both weak aggregate demand and low energy prices. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in May, though by much less than the historic job losses recorded in April. The unemployment rate moved down to 13.3 percent in May after soaring to 14.7 percent in April. As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics, these figures likely understated the extent of un- employment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would have raised the unemploy- ment rate by 5 percentage points in April and 3 percent- age points in May. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increased in May. Initial claims for unemployment insurance ben- efits had declined through the last week of May from their peak in late March, but they still were at a histori- cally elevated level. Average hourly earnings for all em- ployees declined in May after rising sharply in April, but these fluctuations largely reflected the substantial changes in the level and composition of employment, which disproportionately affected lower-wage workers. The employment cost index for total labor compensa- tion in the private sector increased 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March—a period mostly predating the onset of the pandemic—and was the same as its year- earlier pace. Total PCE price inflation was only 0.5 percent over the 12 months ending in April, reflecting both weak aggre- gate demand in recent months and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices. Prices fell in March and April in many categories that were affected the most by social-distancing measures, such as the prices for air travel and hotel accommodations. Core PCE price in- flation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.0 percent over the 12 months end- ing in April. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in April. The consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.1 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI infla- tion was 1.2 percent over the same period. Recent read- ings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. The Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in May, while the 3-year- ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations was un- changed. The 10-year measure for PCE price inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters ticked down in the second quarter. All of these measures of longer- run inflation expectations continued to be near their re- cent ranges. Real PCE slumped in April, with declines widespread across most spending categories. In May, however, light motor vehicle sales and some other high-frequency indi- cators of consumer spending turned up, but the levels of these indicators were mostly still below their levels early in the year. Real disposable personal income increased significantly in April, as a marked decline in wage and Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ salary income was more than offset by a substantial boost from government transfer payments due to recent fiscal policy support; as a result, the personal saving rate soared. The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey crept up in May but remained below their levels early in the year. Real residential investment appeared to be weakening significantly in the second quarter. Starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, dropped sharply in April. Sales of existing homes contracted markedly in April, al- though new home sales edged up. Real business fixed investment continued to tumble in the second quarter. Nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft decreased considerably in April. Nominal business spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min- ing sector also fell in April. In addition, the effects of low crude oil prices were evident in further declines in the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early June, an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector. Total industrial production plunged in April, as many factories slowed or suspended operation in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The decline in manufactur- ing production was widespread across all major indus- tries and was led by a collapse in the output of motor vehicles and related parts. Output in the mining sec- tor—which includes crude oil extraction—also de- creased, reflecting the effects of low crude oil prices. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising moderately in the second quarter. Federal defense spending continued to increase in April, and nondefense purchases were likely to be boosted in the second quar- ter by recent fiscal policy measures related to the coro- navirus. In contrast, state and local purchases looked to be declining, as the payrolls of these governments shrank in April and May, and nominal state and local construc- tion expenditures decreased in April. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in both March and April, as exports of goods and services plunged more than imports. The fall in goods exports was broad based, with particularly sharp declines in au- tomotive products, industrial supplies, and capital goods. Goods imports also contracted significantly in most categories through April, and a near halt of inter- national travel drove a steep decline in exports and im- ports of services. Foreign economic activity contracted in the first quarter, even though most countries abroad introduced strict social-distancing measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus only toward the end of the quarter. In China, where restrictions were largely lifted by the end of the first quarter, data pointed to a relatively quick re- bound in economic activity in the second quarter. Out- side of China, indicators suggested that foreign eco- nomic activity plummeted further in the second quarter, notwithstanding some signs of improvement in May as restrictions started to ease. Inflation rates fell sharply across most foreign economies in April and May. The low level of oil prices relative to a year ago contributed to 12-month inflation rates close to or below zero in many advanced foreign economies (AFEs). Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, risk sentiment improved, on net, as optimism over reopening the economy, po- tential coronavirus treatments, the unexpectedly positive May employment situation report, and other indicators that suggest that economic activity may be rebounding more than offset concerns arising from otherwise dire economic data releases, warnings from health experts that openings may have been premature, and renewed tensions between the United States and China. Equity prices rose, and corporate bond spreads narrowed nota- bly. The Treasury yield curve steepened, and the market- implied expected path of the federal funds rate declined somewhat. Liquidity conditions continued to improve in general, but some stress was still evident in several markets. Financing conditions were still somewhat strained for lower-rated borrowers and small businesses even as announcements and implementation of Federal Reserve facilities during the intermeeting period were supportive of credit flows. The credit quality of busi- nesses and municipal debt weakened. The expected path of the federal funds rate for the next few years, based on a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, declined a bit and remained close to the ELB through late 2023. Market-implied forward rates referring to 2021 and 2022 turned slightly negative for a few days beginning on May 7, though market commen- tary suggested that this development did not reflect in- vestors expecting the FOMC to lower the federal funds rate target range below zero. This view was supported by Federal Reserve communications that negative inter- est rates did not appear to be an attractive policy tool. The Treasury yield curve steepened over the intermeet- ing period, with 2-year yields little changed while 10- and 30-year yields rose. Longer-term yields were likely Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ boosted by expectations of heavy upcoming Treasury se- curity issuance as well as some unwinding of safe-haven demands in connection with improved investor senti- ment. The Treasury’s first 20-year bond offering since 1986 was met with solid demand. Changes in inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities yields were mixed; 5-year inflation compensa- tion rose amid the recent partial rebound in crude oil prices, while the 5-to-10-year measure edged down. At the end of the intermeeting period, both measures stood roughly halfway between their mid-March lows and typ- ical levels seen in recent years. Broad stock price indexes moved higher. One-month implied volatility on the S&P 500 index declined some- what but still stood at the 85th percentile of its distribu- tion since 1990. investment- and Spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds over comparable- maturity Treasury yields narrowed considerably but re- mained at levels similar to those in other periods of no- table economic or bond market stress, though well be- low financial crisis levels. Over the intermeeting period, financial market function- ing appeared to improve in general, although progress was uneven. Liquidity measures improved in the Treas- ury market, but off-the-run Treasury securities of all ten- ors and longer-maturity on-the-run securities remained less liquid than before the onset of the pandemic. Agency MBS market functioning had largely recovered, except for some less liquid parts of the market. Corpo- rate bond market liquidity improved considerably but re- mained somewhat strained, particularly for speculative- grade bonds. Liquidity in the municipal bond markets was still below pre-pandemic levels. Conditions in unsecured short-term funding markets continued to improve over the intermeeting period, and spreads on most types of commercial paper and negotia- ble certificates of deposit narrowed to levels that ap- proached pre-pandemic ranges. Amid better market conditions, take-up in the emergency liquidity facilities declined substantially. Heavy demand for Treasury bills from money market funds held down rates despite an unprecedented pace of issuance. The effective federal funds rate was 5 basis points almost every day over the intermeeting period, and the Secured Overnight Financ- ing Rate averaged 4 basis points. Total outstanding Fed- eral Reserve repos averaged about $170 billion. Amid improving market functioning, Federal Reserve pur- chases of Treasury securities and agency MBS were re- duced from around $10 billion and $8 billion per day, respectively, to $4 billion and $4.5 billion per day, re- spectively, over the intermeeting period. Risk sentiment in foreign financial markets improved over the intermeeting period. Further monetary policy and fiscal policy support in foreign countries, the easing of coronavirus-related restrictions, and a stronger-than- expected U.S. May employment report outweighed con- cerns about otherwise weak global economic data and the resurgence of U.S.–China tensions. Liquidity in global dollar funding markets continued to improve, helped in part by the Federal Reserve’s liquidity pro- grams, and prices of foreign risky assets increased. In the AFEs, option-implied volatility measures declined and long-term sovereign bond yields rose moderately, while fiscal stimulus in Japan and Europe boosted prices in their respective equity markets. Euro-area peripheral bond spreads narrowed after the European Commission proposed that the European Union be given the author- ity to borrow €750 billion to assist the recovery and the European Central Bank (ECB) increased the size of its Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme. In emerg- ing markets, the rise in oil prices since late April and overall improvements in investor sentiment boosted as- set prices, even as the coronavirus outbreak worsened in some countries. Outflows from emerging market funds slowed and then turned into small inflows later in the period. The improving risk sentiment also supported several foreign currencies, and the staff’s broad dollar index fell. The euro appreciated notably over the period, lifted in part by the European fiscal and monetary policy com- munications. The recent rebound in oil prices contrib- uted to a strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased some- what over the intermeeting period, though they re- mained moderately strained for lower-rated borrowers. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance soared to record levels in April and remained robust in May, as is- suers took advantage of more favorable market condi- tions following Federal Reserve announcements of two facilities to support corporate credit markets. Regarding these facilities, the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility began in mid-May to purchase exchange-traded funds whose investment objective is to provide broad exposure to the market for U.S. corporate bonds. Speculative-grade corporate bond issuance picked up considerably toward the end of April from very low lev- els, though it slowed somewhat in May. Commercial and industrial loans on banks’ books surged again in April, Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ largely driven by lending through the Paycheck Protec- tion Program (PPP), especially at smaller banks. Credit- line drawdowns continued in April and May, though drawdowns by large firms slowed considerably from rec- ord levels in March. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin- ued to deteriorate sharply during the intermeeting pe- riod. The volume of nonfinancial corporate bond and leveraged loan downgrades remained very high in April and May. Defaults in corporate bonds and leveraged loans increased as well; market analysts projected de- faults to increase considerably over the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. Financing conditions for small businesses tightened amid widespread continued pandemic-related closures and reduced operations of small businesses. Lenders in- dicated that they had tightened loan standards on small business loans or discontinued lending to such borrow- ers altogether (other than PPP loans). Financing condi- tions for state and local governments improved moder- ately following several Federal Reserve announcements to support the municipal debt market, but conditions re- mained somewhat strained for lower-rated states and municipalities. In the first week of June, the State of Il- linois became the first to use the Municipal Liquidity Fa- cility. Commercial real estate (CRE) lending conditions recov- ered somewhat during the intermeeting period. Spreads on triple-A-rated and triple-B-rated non-agency CMBS declined in May but remained elevated relative to before the pandemic, and issuance showed signs of recovery in late April and early May. Federal Reserve purchases of agency CMBS reportedly helped return spreads on these securities to their pre-pandemic levels, and issuance in that market continued to be strong. However, early signs of credit repayment difficulties emerged in some CRE sectors. The volume of mortgage rate locks for home-purchase loans picked up in mid-May following a material drop in April. Financing conditions remained tight for borrow- ers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages. In addition, options for home equity extraction continued to be restricted, as credit for both home equity lines of credit and cash-out refinances was limited. Servicers were able to handle the liquidity strains imposed by forbearance. The sharp decline in economic activity had also curtailed the demand for consumer credit. On balance, consumer credit financing conditions did not appear to be a major drag on household spending. Issuance of consumer asset-backed securities resumed in mid-April and in early May but remained significantly below pre-pandemic lev- els. Staff Economic Outlook The projection for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting was downgraded, on balance, as compared with the April meeting forecast in response to information on the spread of the corona- virus and changes in the measures undertaken to contain it both at home and abroad, along with incoming eco- nomic data. U.S. real GDP was forecast to show a his- torically large decline in the second quarter of this year, and the unemployment rate was expected to be sharply higher than in the first quarter. The substantial fiscal policy measures and appreciable support from monetary policy, along with the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to help mitigate the de- terioration in current economic conditions and to help boost the recovery. The staff continued to judge that the future performance of the economy would depend importantly on the evo- lution of the coronavirus outbreak and the measures un- dertaken to contain it. Under the staff’s baseline as- sumptions that the current restrictions on social interac- tions and business operations would continue to ease gradually this year, real GDP was forecast to rise appre- ciably and the unemployment rate to decline considera- bly in the second half of the year, although a complete recovery was not expected by year-end. Inflation was projected to weaken this year, reflecting both the deteri- oration in resource utilization and sizable expected de- clines in consumer energy prices. Under the baseline as- sumptions, economic conditions were projected to con- tinue to improve, and inflation to pick back up, over the next two years. The staff still observed that the uncertainty related to the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic was ex- tremely elevated and that the historical behavior of the U.S. economy in response to past economic shocks pro- vided limited guidance for making judgments about how the economy might evolve in the future. In light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the pandemic, including how much the economy would weaken and how long it would take to recover, the staff judged that a more pessimistic projection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast. In this sce- nario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict limitations on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin later this Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year. Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2020 through 2022 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy—including the path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections repre- sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants noted that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The vi- rus and the measures taken to protect public health in- duced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Fi- nancial conditions had improved, in part reflecting pol- icy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that lowering the federal funds rate to its ELB had established more accommodative finan- cial conditions and that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing purchases of sizable quantities of Treasury securities and agency MBS had helped restore smooth market func- tioning to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The fiscal response to economic developments had been large and timely and was providing much needed support for economic activity. Credit flows and economic activity were also being supported by the lending facilities established un- der the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Participants judged that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and the ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and would pose considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. Partici- pants agreed that the data for the second quarter would likely show the largest decline in economic activity in post–World War II history. Based in part on infor- mation from their Districts, participants observed that the burdens of the present crisis were not falling equally on all Americans and noted that the rise in joblessness was especially severe for lower-wage workers, women, African Americans, and Hispanics. Participants agreed that recently enacted fiscal policy programs had been de- livering valuable direct financial aid to households, busi- nesses, and communities, as well as providing relief to disadvantaged groups. Regarding household spending, participants pointed to information from District contacts, to surveys of con- sumer behavior, and to high-frequency indicators—such as credit card transactions, automated teller machine vis- its, and cellphone data tracking—as suggesting that con- sumer expenditures may be stabilizing or rebounding modestly. Limited available sources of standard eco- nomic data, such as retail purchases and motor vehicle sales, also seemed in line with this impression. With sup- portive monetary policy and payments to households under the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act), including enhanced unemploy- ment insurance payments, participants expected per- sonal consumption expenditures to grow strongly in the second half of the year, albeit from very low levels. However, the recovery in consumer spending was not expected to be particularly rapid beyond this year, with voluntary social distancing, precautionary saving, and lower levels of employment and income restraining the pace of expansion over the medium term. Participants noted that levels of uncertainty and risks perceived by businesses remained high and that these factors continued to contribute to restraints on capital expenditures, despite easing in financing conditions stemming in part from recent policy measures. Some business contacts pointed to halting improvements in consumer demand, a dearth in public infrastructure pro- jects due to strained state and local government budget conditions, or the decline in energy prices as factors likely to depress business spending. Some participants also noted reports of firms stating that they have had some challenges in rehiring employees, in part related to temporary enhanced unemployment insurance benefits. Participants generally agreed that practices and develop- ments in public health to address the pandemic would be critical for ensuring a strong and lasting reopening of businesses and reducing the likelihood of an outsized wave of closures, but monetary policy and, especially, Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ fiscal policy would play important roles. Nevertheless, participants concluded that voluntary social distancing and structural shifts stemming from the pandemic would likely mean that some proportion of businesses would close permanently. Noting ongoing changes in the com- position of production and the processes by which pro- duction takes place, participants suggested that some business adaptations were likely to endure long after the coronavirus subsides, resulting in notable dislocation and sectoral reallocation of firms and workers across in- dustries. Participants noted that conditions in the energy sector remained difficult amid still-low oil prices. Several par- ticipants anticipated continued low drilling activity, at least until excess inventories were reduced later this year, and expressed concern that a wave of bankruptcies in the energy sector could be forthcoming. In addition, the agricultural sector continued to be under stress due to low prices for some farm commodities, reduced ethanol production, and pandemic-related limitations on pro- duction for some food processing plants. With regard to the labor market, participants remarked on the surprisingly positive news from the labor market report for May but emphasized that nearly 20 million jobs had been lost, on net, since February. Participants noted that because of misclassification errors in the Cur- rent Population Survey, the official unemployment rate for May likely understated the extent of unemployment; others observed that government reliance on unemploy- ment insurance as a vehicle for income support under the CARES Act complicates the interpretation of the data. Participants also noted that unemployment insur- ance claims continued to run at a historically elevated level, but the proportion of laid-off workers who ex- pected to be recalled was unusually large. Taken to- gether, the data suggested that April could turn out to be the trough of the recession, but participants agreed that it was too early to draw any firm conclusions. Prospects for further substantial improvement in the la- bor market were seen as depending on a sustained reo- pening of the economy, which in turn depended in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the effects of the coronavirus. On this issue, participants judged there to be a great deal of uncertainty and ex- pressed concerns about the possibility that an early reo- pening would contribute to a significant increase of in- fections. Participants also regarded highly accommoda- tive monetary policy and sustained support from fiscal policy as likely to be needed to facilitate a durable recov- ery in labor market conditions. Overall, participants ex- pected that a full recovery in employment would take some time. With regard to inflation, participants reiterated their view that the negative effect from the pandemic on ag- gregate demand was likely to more than offset any up- ward pressure from supply constraints so that the overall effect of the outbreak on prices was seen as disinflation- ary. Consistent with that interpretation, participants ob- served the recent negative readings on the monthly CPI and noted that they anticipated that the 12-month PCE inflation measure would likely run well below the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective for some time. Observing that inflation had been running somewhat below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective before the coronavirus outbreak, some participants noted a risk that long-term inflation expectations might deteriorate. Participants noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective over the longer run. Participants commented that there remained an extraor- dinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to the economic outlook. Participants shared views on possible outcomes for the reopening of the economy, the prospects for effective voluntary social distancing, and the efficacy of public health initiatives for their im- plications for economic activity and employment. A number of participants judged that there was a substan- tial likelihood of additional waves of outbreaks, which, in some scenarios, could result in further economic dis- ruptions and possibly a protracted period of reduced economic activity. Other possibilities included eco- nomic activity that might recover more quickly if sizable, widespread outbreaks could be avoided even as house- holds and businesses relax or modify social-distancing behaviors. Among the other sources of risk noted by participants were that fiscal support for households, businesses, and state and local governments might prove to be insufficient and that foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad. Participants stressed that measures taken in the areas of health-care policy and fiscal policy, together with actions by house- holds and businesses, would shape the prospects for a prompt and timely return of the U.S. economy to more normal conditions. In addition, participants agreed that recent actions taken by the Federal Reserve had helped reduce risks to the economic outlook. Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ As part of their discussions of longer-run risks, partici- pants noted that in some adverse scenarios, more busi- ness closures would occur, and workers would experi- ence longer spells of unemployment that could lead to a loss of skills that could impair their employment pro- spects. In addition, to the extent that transmission- mitigation procedures adopted by firms reduced their productivity, or if the reallocation of industry output re- sulted in a lasting reduction in business investment, the longer-run level of potential output could be reduced. Regarding developments in financial markets, partici- pants agreed that ongoing actions by the Federal Re- serve, including those undertaken in collaboration with the Treasury, had helped ease strains in some financial markets and supported the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. Measures of market func- tioning in the markets for Treasury securities and agency MBS had improved substantially since March. Strains in short-term funding markets had receded as well, and the volume of borrowing at many of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity facilities had moved lower as borrowers re- turned to market sources of funding. Risk spreads across a range of fixed-income markets had narrowed as the intense flight to safety witnessed in financial markets in the spring ebbed further. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promot- ing its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In light of their assessment that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term, all participants judged that it would be ap- propriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Keeping the target range at the ELB would continue to provide support to the economy and promote the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability goals. Participants also judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the tar- get range for the federal funds rate at its present level until policymakers were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Participants also agreed that, to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering ef- fective transmission of monetary policy to broader fi- nancial conditions. In addition, the Desk would con- tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo oper- ations. Participants noted that it would be important to continue to monitor developments closely and that the Committee would be prepared to adjust its plans as ap- propriate. Participants also commented that the lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve under the authority of section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act were sup- porting financial market functioning and the flow of credit to households, businesses of all sizes, and state and local governments. Several participants commented further that it would be important for the Federal Re- serve to remain ready to adjust these emergency lending facilities as appropriate based on its monitoring of finan- cial market functioning and credit conditions. Participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy remained appropriate, but many noted that the Committee could, at upcoming meetings, further clarify its intentions with respect to its future monetary policy decisions as the economic outlook becomes clearer. In particular, most participants commented that the Com- mittee should communicate a more explicit form of for- ward guidance for the path of the federal funds rate and provide more clarity regarding purchases of Treasury se- curities and agency MBS as more information about the trajectory of the economy becomes available. A number of participants judged that it was important for forward guidance and asset purchases to be structured in a way that provides the accommodation necessary to support rapid economic recovery and fosters a durable return of inflation and inflation expectations to levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Many participants remarked that the completion of the monetary policy framework review, together with the announcement of the conclusions arising from the re- view and the release of a revised Committee statement on its goals and policy strategy, would help clarify further how the Committee intends to conduct monetary policy going forward. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus- ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health had induced sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ losses. Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices. Fi- nancial conditions had improved, in part reflecting pol- icy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and communities. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was commit- ted to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Members further concurred that the ongoing public health crisis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable downside risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the eco- nomic outlook, including information related to public health, as well as global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, and would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determin- ing the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment ob- jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market condi- tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS and agency CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Desk would continue to of- fer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Members agreed that they would closely monitor devel- opments and be prepared to adjust their plans as appro- priate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 11, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:   Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.  Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund- ing markets.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter- party limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Minutes of the Meeting of June 9–10, 2020Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. The virus and the measures taken to protect public health have induced sharp declines in economic activ- ity and a surge in job losses. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Financial con- ditions have improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considera- ble risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. In light of these developments, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weath- ered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury se- curities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the cur- rent pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will con- tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term re- purchase agreement operations. The Commit- tee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective June 11, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 28–29, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on June 10, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on May 19, 2020, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on April 28–29, 2020. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 9–10, 2020, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ- ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af- fect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab- sence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out- comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat- isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. The current projections for real activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation were substantially weaker than the pro- jections in the December 2019 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) because participants revised their eco- nomic outlook in light of the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the measures taken to con- tain it.2 Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections; participants’ projections in the cur- rent SEP reflected their assumptions about the course of the pandemic and actions to control its spread. All par- ticipants projected that real GDP will contract sharply in 2020 and that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of the year would be markedly higher than they had pro- jected in December. Almost all participants projected that real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its longer-run normal growth rate in 2021 and 2022 and that the unemployment rate would decline. Participants expected that a full economic recovery would take some time, with almost all participants projecting that the un- employment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their estimates of its level in the longer run. Similarly, almost all participants projected that total in- flation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures (PCE), would be below the FOMC’s 2 percent in- flation objective throughout the forecast period. Projec- tions for core PCE inflation, which excludes food and energy, generally followed a trajectory similar to the pro- jections for total inflation. As shown in figure 2, almost all participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the economy, relative to the Committee’s objectives of max- imum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through at least the end of 2022. The median of partic- ipants’ assessments of the longer-run level for the federal funds rate was unchanged from its value in the Decem- ber SEP. Amid uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and its effects on the economy, all participants regarded the uncertainties around their projections as higher than the average over the past 20 years. In addition, a substantial majority of participants assessed the risks to their out- look for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside. The risks to inflation projections were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of participants; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unem- ployment Rate As illustrated in figure 3.A, which shows the distribu- tions of participants’ projections for real GDP growth from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run, all participants projected that real GDP will decline in 2020, a develop- ment that reflects the coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread. The projec- tions ranged from a decline of 10.0 percent to a decline of 4.2 percent, with the median projection being a de- crease of 6.5 percent. These projections were substan- tially weaker than those from the December SEP when real GDP was expected to expand this year at close to participants’ estimates of its longer-run rate. Current ex- 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. 2 The preceding SEP occurred in December 2019. Because of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the March 2020 FOMC meeting, participants did not submit quarterly eco- nomic projections at that meeting.

PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The December projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on December 10–11, 2019. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 10–11, 2019, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the June 9–10, 2020, meeting. No projections were submitted in conjunction with the March 2020 FOMC meeting. 1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest.

Almost all partic- ipants expected that the rate of real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 would be above their estimates of its longer- run pace, with the median projections being 5.0 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively. The distribution of esti- mates of real GDP growth in the longer run was little changed from the December SEP, although the median projection ticked down to 1.8 percent. The distributions of participants’ projections for the un- employment rate from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run are shown in figure 3.B. Reflecting the effects of the pandemic, the projections for the unemployment rate were revised up considerably throughout the forecast period relative to the December SEP. The projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this year ranged from 7.0 to 14.0 percent, with a median of 9.3 percent. For the final quarter of 2021, the projec- tions for the unemployment rate ranged from 4.5 to 12.0 percent, with the median being 6.5 percent. The width of the ranges of the forecasts for the unemploy- ment rate in the final quarters of this year and next year were 7.0 percentage points and 7.5 percentage points, re- spectively—more than three times the widest ranges for forecasts of similar horizons that were submitted from 2007 to 2009. This unusually wide range of projections highlighted the challenges of assessing the economic damage caused by the pandemic and of forecasting the recovery in the labor market. The median projection for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022, at 5.5 percent, was above the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 percent. Indeed, almost all participants who submitted longer- run projections expected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2022 would still be above their esti- mates of the longer-run value. Participants pointed to a number of factors to explain the persistence of labor market slack, including the continuation of voluntary so- cial distancing, unusual disruptions to labor markets, and the need for businesses to restructure supply chains and other aspects of their operations. The distribution of estimates for the longer-run unemployment rate was lit- tle changed from the December SEP. The Outlook for Inflation Figures 3.C and 3.D show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for total and core PCE inflation from 2020 to 2022 and in the longer run. All participants re- vised down their projections for inflation in 2020 relative to their December projections. Participants expected that, in 2020, total inflation would be between 0.5 and 1.2 percent, while core inflation would be between Table 2.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using His- torical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx. doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020. 1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. 0.7 and 1.3 percent, with median expectations for total and core inflation of 0.8 percent and 1.0 percent, respec- tively. In the December SEP, participants had expected that total inflation would be between 1.7 and 2.3 percent in 2020. In the current SEP, almost all participants ex- pected the inflation rate to rise over the next two years. However, the vast majority of participants expected PCE price inflation in 2022 to fall short of the Commit- tee’s 2 percent inflation objective, with the median pro- jection for total PCE price inflation being 1.7 percent. Appropriate Monetary Policy The distributions of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2020 to 2022 and over the longer run are shown in figure 3.E. With substantial agreement that the unem- ployment rate would remain above its longer-run level throughout the forecast period and that inflation would run below the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, al- most all participants projected that it would be appropri- ate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2022. The median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was unchanged from December at 2.50 percent, although a few participants revised down their estimates.

Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections relative to the average level of uncertainty over the past 20 years are shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4.3 All participants viewed the current uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables—real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE inflation, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over the past 20 years, which is the first time this situation has occurred since the introduction of the SEP in 2007.4 Participants’ assessments of the balance of risks to their current economic projections are shown in the panels on the right side of figure 4. A substantial majority of par- ticipants judged the risks to their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate projections as weighted to the upside. A substantial majority of participants viewed the risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the downside; no participant assessed the risks to his or her inflation outlook as weighted to the upside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, the course of the pandemic was generally mentioned as a key source of uncertainty. The possibilities of second waves of contagion and delays in developing a vaccine were seen as potential downside risks to the economic outlook, and faster-than- anticipated progress in responding to or treating the coronavirus were seen as potential upside risks. Partici- pants also mentioned a number of other unknowns and risk factors related to the outlook, including the extent of supply-side disruptions; possible changes in house- hold behavior; the degree to which business bankrupt- cies might cause dislocations; the extent of fiscal policy support; and possibly depressed foreign demand given the global nature of the pandemic. Several participants also expressed concerns about longer-run issues in the event of a prolonged recession, such as labor market scarring if the unemployment rate remained elevated and inflation persistently undershooting the FOMC’s 2 per- cent inflation objective. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective develop- ments over time in key economic variables—such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation— uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed- eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial. 3 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast un- certainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 through 2019. At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of un- certainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ projections. 4 Previous SEP addendums to the FOMC minutes contained figures showing the median projections, along with confi- dence intervals based on historical forecast errors. Because the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook is cur- rently judged to be higher than its historical average as a result of uncertainty about the course of the coronavirus and its ef- fects on the economy, these “fan charts” have been omitted from this addendum.

Considera- ble uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily im- perfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unfore- seen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic out- come as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Fed- eral Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considera- ble uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those pro- jections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, and 1.0 to 5.0 per- cent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in ta- ble 2. That is, participants judge whether each economic variable is more likely to be above or below their projec- tions of the most likely outcome. These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attending each participant’s projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ views about the most likely outcomes. Forecast uncer- tainty is concerned with the risks associated with a partic- ular projection rather than with divergences across a num- ber of different projections. As with real activity and in- flation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncer- tainty arises primarily because each participant’s assess- ment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy de- pends importantly on the evolution of real activity and in- flation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an un- expected manner, then assessments of the appropriate set- ting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with pro- jections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of par- ticipants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the fore- cast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

At this meeting, they discussed potential changes to the Com- mittee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Participants agreed that, in light of fun- damental changes in the economy over the past dec- ade—including generally lower levels of interest rates and persistent disinflationary pressures in the United States and abroad—and given what has been learned during the monetary policy framework review, refining the statement could be helpful in increasing the trans- parency and accountability of monetary policy. Such re- finements could also facilitate well-informed deci- sionmaking by households and businesses, and, as a re- sult, better position the Committee to meet its maxi- mum-employment and price-stability objectives. Partic- ipants noted that the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy serves as the foundation for the Committee’s policy actions and that it would be important to finalize all changes to the statement in the near future. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager turned first to a review of U.S. financial market develop- ments. Over the intermeeting period, overall financial conditions eased slightly. Broad equity price indexes 6 Attended the discussion of developments in financial mar- kets and open market operations. 7 Attended Tuesday’s session only. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ were roughly flat even as concerns about the resurgence in the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United States grew. At the same time, Treasury yields and other sov- ereign yields declined, and the U.S. dollar weakened. Overall, volatility remained subdued relative to recent periods. While the S&P 500 index was little changed, the effect of renewed outbreaks was evident in the differentiated performance across S&P industry sectors. Virus-sensi- tive sectors and firms with weaker fundamentals under- performed over the period, as they had over the broader pandemic episode. Airline and hotel share prices de- clined sharply, and share prices of banks—which faced earnings pressures from large loan loss provisions and compressed net interest margins—continued to under- perform. As the SOMA manager highlighted, the S&P 500 index has been supported by its significant share of technology firms, many of which have been relatively re- silient to virus containment measures. In contrast, smaller firms not well represented in the S&P 500 may be experiencing greater effects on their businesses due to the virus—a possibility consistent with the underper- formance of the broader Russell 2000 index over the in- termeeting period. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate shifted down modestly over the intermeeting period. The cor- responding path implied by responses to the Open Mar- ket Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants also fell, as the probabilities placed on rate hikes next year and in 2022 declined. Market pricing suggested that the federal funds rate was ex- pected to first rise above the current target range in 2024. That timing was broadly consistent with survey respond- ents’ expectations regarding the timing of the first in- crease in the target range, although the range of survey responses was wide. The SOMA manager noted that survey responses suggested that the dispersion in views about the timing of a rate increase might be related to differing views about the economic conditions that would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target range, as survey respondents’ views about those condi- tions were also dispersed. The SOMA manager reported that market functioning across a number of market segments remained stable at significantly improved levels. In Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) markets, many mar- ket functioning indicators had returned to levels prevail- ing before the pandemic, and, as a result, purchases were conducted at the minimum pace directed by the Com- mittee. Importantly, with conditions in MBS markets continuing to stabilize, primary mortgage rates fell to historically low levels over the intermeeting period. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets were also stable, with overnight rates close to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. In broader dollar funding markets, term unsecured rates and foreign exchange swap spreads were also steady. Federal Reserve repur- chase agreements (repos) outstanding fell from $185 bil- lion to zero over the intermeeting period. With the tim- ing of the overnight operations now having shifted to the afternoon when most trading activity in the repo market is complete and with minimum bid rates above the IOER rate, repo operations had been effectively po- sitioned in a backstop role for the time being. As term U.S. dollar liquidity swaps matured, the amounts out- standing fell to around $120 billion, less than a third of the peak reached in late May. In light of improved conditions across these markets, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet declined over the in- termeeting period from $7.2 trillion to $7.0 trillion. The decline was driven by the reductions in repo and U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding. These reductions more than offset ongoing purchases of Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS. The manager discussed a proposal to extend the tempo- rary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements as well as the temporary FIMA (Foreign and International Mone- tary Authorities) Repo Facility through March of next year. Keeping these arrangements in place would help sustain recent improvements in global dollar funding markets and support smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market. Under the proposal, provided that the Committee had no objections, the Chair would approve the extension of the temporary liquidity swap lines fol- lowing the meeting. The extensions of the swap and FIMA repo arrangements would be announced follow- ing this meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to approve a resolution that extended through March 31, 2021, the expiration of a temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facil- ity).8 8 The approved FIMA Desk Resolution, which updates the March 2020 resolution with a new expiration date, is available with other Committee organizational documents at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_au- thorizations.htm. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020Page 3 Secretary’s note: The Chair subsequently pro- vided approval to the Desk, following the pro- cedures in the Authorization for Foreign Cur- rency Operations, to extend the expiration of the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines through March 31, 2021. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus outbreak and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to have substantial ef- fects on economic activity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the July 28–29 meeting suggested that U.S. economic activ- ity had picked up in May and June following sharp de- clines in March and April. Measured on a quarterly basis, however, it appeared that real gross domestic product (GDP) had decreased at a historically rapid rate in the second quarter. Labor market conditions improved con- siderably in June, but the improvements over May and June were modest relative to the substantial deteriora- tion seen in March and April. Consumer price infla- tion—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures (PCE) through May—remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded robustly in June, as it did in May, but the gains in those two months offset only about one-third of the jobs lost in March and April. The unemployment rate moved down further to 11.1 percent, but it continued to be far above its level at the beginning of the year. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics de- clined, on balance, over the past two months but re- mained well above the national average. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-popula- tion ratio increased further in June. Initial claims for un- employment insurance benefits continued to decrease, on net, through the middle of July, but the pace of de- clines had slowed in recent weeks. In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll proces- sor ADP, along with some other high-frequency measures—such as employment at small businesses and job postings—suggested that employment gains had slowed since mid-June but likely were still strong. Total PCE price inflation was 0.5 percent over the 12 months ending in May, reflecting both weak aggre- gate demand and a considerable drop in consumer en- ergy prices. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.0 percent over the same 12-month period. In contrast, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price in- flation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las was 2.0 percent in May. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 0.6 percent over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 1.2 percent over the same period. On a monthly basis, the available data indicated that consumer prices—as measured by the PCE price index in May and the CPI in June—had turned up after having fallen in March and April; this re- bound was evident in many price categories that were most affected by social-distancing measures. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla- tion expectations were little changed on balance. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years was unchanged, on net, from May to early July; the three-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Con- sumer Expectations edged down in June but remained within its recent range. Real PCE rebounded robustly in May, with particularly strong growth in spending for consumer goods but more moderate gains in expenditures for consumer services. In June, the components of retail sales used by the Bu- reau of Economic Analysis to estimate PCE, along with light motor vehicle sales, increased further. Overall, however, real consumer spending remained well below the levels that prevailed at the beginning of the year. Moreover, recent high-frequency indicators of spending on many consumer services—such as restaurant dining, hotel accommodations, and air travel—remained very subdued. Real disposable personal income fell back in May, primarily reflecting the waning of the substantial boost that federal stimulus payments had provided in April. However, wage and salary income increased strongly in May, though to a level still below its February value, and unemployment insurance benefits continued to be substantial, leaving the personal saving rate quite elevated. The consumer sentiment measures from both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board survey improved notably in June but fell back somewhat in July. Housing-sector activity bounced back strongly in recent months, likely boosted in part by the effects of low in- terest rates. Starts and building permit issuance for sin- gle-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, increased significantly over May and June; however, Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ these construction measures were still below their pre- pandemic levels. Sales of existing homes rose substan- tially over those two months, and new home sales also moved up on net. Indicators of business fixed investment suggested that investment had generally not begun to recover but that the pace of declines had moderated, on balance, in re- cent months. Nominal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in May and June, but they remained below their levels at the beginning of the year, while some measures of busi- ness sentiment improved. Nominal business spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined further in May, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indica- tor of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to decrease through late July. Industrial production expanded briskly in May and June, as many factories reopened or ramped up production. The surge in manufacturing production was led by ap- preciable gains in the output of motor vehicles and re- lated parts following extended automaker shutdowns from mid-March through April. In contrast, output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil extrac- tion—decreased further, reflecting the effects of still- low crude oil prices. Total real government purchases appeared to have in- creased moderately, on balance, in the second quarter. Federal defense spending continued to rise through June, and nondefense purchases were likely boosted in the second quarter by fiscal policy measures taken in re- sponse to the coronavirus. In contrast, state and local purchases looked to have declined markedly, as the pay- rolls of these governments shrank further in June, and nominal state and local construction expenditures de- creased, on net, over April and May. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in May relative to April, as exports decreased more than imports. The fall in exports was broad based across goods categories, while lower imports of automotive products more than offset higher imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies. Following April’s historic plunge, exports and imports of services fell a bit further in May, driven by the continued suspension of most in- ternational travel. Preliminary data for June showed some recovery in nominal goods exports and imports. Altogether, the available data suggested that net exports were a significant drag on the rate of change in real GDP in the second quarter. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the corona- virus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain it. There were also signs that many foreign economies started to recover over the past few months as re- strictions were gradually eased. In China, where eco- nomic activity had collapsed in the first quarter and re- strictions were rolled back earlier than elsewhere, the preliminary GDP release showed that the economy bounced back strongly in the second quarter. In the euro area and other advanced foreign economies, recent data on industrial production and, to a lesser extent, con- sumer spending showed a partial recovery in May and June. However, continued uncertainty about the course of the virus was underscored by the fact that some emerging market economies were struggling to control the pandemic, while some other countries that previ- ously contained the virus were experiencing flare-ups of new infections. Inflation rates continued to fall in most foreign economies through June because of low energy prices and weak demand, and measures of inflation ex- pectations remained subdued. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Amid sizable fluctuations, changes in asset prices over the intermeeting period were mixed on net. Financial market sentiment was boosted by better-than-expected economic data for the United States, China, and Europe. However, the boost to sentiment appeared to have been offset by concerns about the domestic spread of the coronavirus and its uncertain effects on the future course of the economy. On balance, broad equity price indexes were roughly unchanged, Treasury yields de- clined and the yield curve flattened, corporate and mu- nicipal bond spreads narrowed, and the dollar weakened somewhat. Liquidity conditions continued to normalize but had not returned to their pre-pandemic levels in sev- eral markets. Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treas- ury securities fell and the yield curve flattened on net. Yields declined somewhat at the start of the intermeeting period following the more-accommodative-than-ex- pected June FOMC communications. The further de- cline in yields that occurred over subsequent weeks likely reflected concerns about the surge in confirmed corona- virus cases across many parts of the United States. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing over the next few years continued to rebound from their sharp drop in mid-March. The rebound was reportedly driven primar- ily by investors’ interpretation of recent economic data, which suggested that the risk of deflation had abated _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020Page 5 somewhat, as well as by some improvement in market liquidity. Despite the uptick, both the 5-year and 10-year measures of inflation compensation remained below their pre-pandemic levels. The expected path of the fed- eral funds rate based on a straight read of overnight in- dex swap quotes declined modestly and stayed close to the effective lower bound at least through the first half of 2024. Market-implied forward rates referring to 2021 and 2022 remained slightly negative; however, market commentary suggested that investors generally did not expect the FOMC to lower the federal funds target range below zero. Broad stock price indexes fluctuated substantially, largely in reaction to news about the pandemic and eco- nomic activity, and ended the intermeeting period roughly unchanged. Technology stocks continued to outperform the broader market, whereas equity prices in the bank and energy sectors fell notably over the period. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in- dex—the VIX—rose markedly earlier in the period but subsequently declined and ended the period lower. Eq- uity market volatility remained elevated relative to its normal range over the past several years. Spreads of in- vestment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed somewhat and had retraced most of their pandemic-re- lated surge. Conditions in short-term funding markets were generally stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads for nego- tiable certificates of deposit and most types of commer- cial paper were little changed, on net, and spreads and issuance volumes for both types of instruments reached pre-pandemic levels. In light of the stable market con- ditions, there was little activity in the emergency liquidity facilities. Since the June FOMC meeting, assets under management for prime money market funds (MMFs) were little changed, whereas government MMFs experi- enced moderate outflows. Amid heavy issuance of se- curities by the Treasury, government MMFs continued to increase their holdings of Treasury securities while re- ducing their holdings of repos. The effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) increased, on aver- age, 4 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively, from the previous intermeeting period. The EFFR fluctuated between 8 and 10 basis points, and the SOFR fluctuated between 7 and 13 basis points, throughout the inter- meeting period. The decline in total outstanding Federal Reserve repo operations from $185 billion to zero largely reflected an increase in minimum bid rates at the Federal Reserve’s overnight and term repo operations. Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve main- tained the purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the pace prevailing at the end of the previous intermeeting period. Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coro- navirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support. Foreign equity prices generally declined on net. A resurgence of geopolitical tensions between the United States and China weighed on investor senti- ment late in the period and prompted a partial retrace- ment of earlier gains for the Shanghai Composite Index. Long-term sovereign yields in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) ended the period moderately lower. The yield spreads of long-term Italian bonds over their German counterparts narrowed further, reaching the lowest level since March following agreement on the Eu- ropean Union (EU) Recovery Fund. The staff’s broad dollar index declined slightly, on net, with moderate depreciation against AFE currencies. The EU Recovery Fund agreement supported the euro, which appreciated about 3 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period. In contrast, the Brazilian real depreciated about 5 percent against the dollar, amid continued policy rate cuts by the Central Bank of Brazil, escalating coronavirus cases, and political turmoil in Bra- zil. Capital market financing conditions for nonfinancial firms eased somewhat further over the intermeeting pe- riod, with yields on corporate bonds remaining near his- torical lows. Investment-grade corporate bond issuance was solid in June, and speculative-grade issuance re- mained robust. Gross institutional leveraged loan issu- ance picked up in June from its subdued levels in previ- ous months. Gross equity issuance hit a record level in June, as the volume of seasoned equity offerings reached a new record, while initial public offerings rebounded from their very low levels of the previous three months. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported a notable tightening of lending standards on commercial and in- dustrial (C&I) loans to firms of all sizes in the second quarter. Standards were reported to be at the tighter end of their range since 2005, a marked change from a year ago. C&I loans on banks’ balance sheets contracted sig- nificantly in June, reflecting paydowns of the record draws on credit lines seen in previous months, as well as low originations. Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated further over the intermeeting period, with a sizable vol- ume of speculative-grade debt downgraded in June. De- faults in May reached their highest single-month volume since 2009, and June defaults were high as well. Market indicators of future default expectations also deterio- rated somewhat. Municipal market financing conditions remained accommodative, although the credit quality of municipal debt continued to show signs of weakness. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight. Banks reported in the July SLOOS that the level of standards for small businesses was at the tighter end of the range since 2005. At the same time, the credit needs of small businesses remained high, as the prospect arose of many businesses having to shut down opera- tions again in response to rising coronavirus cases. Small business loan performance deteriorated significantly; short-term delinquencies were comparable with levels seen in early 2008. Amid tighter lending standards and high credit demand, advances via the Paycheck Protec- tion Program Lending Facility continued to grow over the intermeeting period. In early July, the Main Street Lending Program became fully operational. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE), particularly those in capital markets, recovered further over the intermeeting period. Spreads on non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) contin- ued to decline in June, while issuance of non-agency CMBS continued to show signs of moderate recovery in May and June. Spreads on agency CMBS remained at pre-pandemic levels, and agency CMBS issuance was strong. In contrast, bank lending standards for CRE loans tightened further, according to the July SLOOS, and CRE loan growth at banks slowed. The credit qual- ity of existing CRE loans continued to deteriorate as fur- ther signs of repayment difficulties emerged, most nota- bly in the lodging and retail sectors. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were generally unchanged over the intermeeting period. The spread between the primary mortgage rate and MBS yields remained wide, reflecting capacity constraints at loan originators, increased origination costs, and de- creases in the value of servicing rights. Credit continued to flow to borrowers with higher credit scores seeking mortgages that met standard conforming loan criteria, and low mortgage interest rates supported elevated refi- nancing activity. Financing conditions remained tight, however, for borrowers with relatively low credit scores and for those seeking nonconforming mortgages. The July SLOOS and other surveys of mortgage market con- ditions suggested that both bank and nonbank lenders tightened standards in the second quarter. The credit quality of mortgages did not appear to deteriorate fur- ther over the period. Financing conditions for consumer credit tightened a bit further during the intermeeting period. In the credit card market, lending standards at commercial banks tightened further according to the July SLOOS. In con- trast, conditions in the auto loan market appeared to be little changed, on balance, with those for subprime bor- rowers remaining tight. Conditions in the consumer as- set-backed securities (ABS) markets were stable during the intermeeting period. Yield spreads for certain highly rated credit card and auto loan ABS stabilized at pre- pandemic levels, while student and auto loan ABS issu- ance recovered to a pre-pandemic pace. Consumer credit quality remained stable, partly due to forbearance programs. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system, and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable, while noting an unusually high level of uncertainty associated with this assessment. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures were notable. In particular, high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond spreads were within historical norms, and com- mercial real estate prices were continuing to increase de- spite rising vacancy rates. The staff assessed vulnerabil- ities due to nonfinancial leverage to have risen from moderate to notable, reflecting declines in household in- comes and business profits; such declines implied less resilient borrowers. The expected sharp decline in sec- ond-quarter real GDP would likely result in a rise in the ratio of household debt to nominal GDP. The ratio of business debt to nominal GDP rose in the first quarter from levels that were already historically high—amid de- clining profits and deteriorating credit quality—although low interest rates had helped ease firms’ debt servicing burdens. The staff assessed vulnerabilities arising from financial leverage to have increased from low to moder- ate, citing uncertainty about losses connected to business loans for banks and a higher weight on vulnerabilities connected to leverage at nonbank financial institutions. Vulnerabilities associated with maturity and liquidity transformation were characterized as moderate, and the staff noted that Federal Reserve facilities reduced these vulnerabilities at nonbanks. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020Page 7 Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting, the estimated level of real GDP in the second quarter was marked up compared with the June meeting forecast, reflecting the better- than-expected data through June. Nevertheless, eco- nomic activity still appeared to have declined at a histor- ically rapid rate in the second quarter. The projected rate of recovery in real GDP, and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate, over the second half of this year were expected to be somewhat less robust than in the previous forecast. Although the staff assumed that ad- ditional fiscal stimulus measures would be enacted be- yond those anticipated in the June forecast, the positive effect on the economic outlook was outweighed some- what by the staff’s assessment of the likely effects of sev- eral other factors. Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid- June; the reactions of many states and localities in slow- ing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, es- pecially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a decel- eration in economic activity. Substantial fiscal policy measures—both enacted and anticipated—along with appreciable support from monetary policy and the Fed- eral Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities were ex- pected to continue bolstering the economic recovery, although a complete recovery was not expected by year- end. Inflation was projected to remain subdued this year, reflecting the substantial amount of slack in re- source utilization and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year. The staff’s baseline as- sumptions were that the current restrictions on social in- teractions and business operations, along with voluntary social distancing by individuals, would ease gradually through next year. As a result, the rate of real GDP growth was projected to exceed potential output growth, the unemployment rate was expected to decline consid- erably, and inflation was forecast to pick back up over 2021 and 2022. The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re- lated to the economic effects of the pandemic was ex- tremely elevated and that the unusual nature of the pan- demic-related shock made assessments about how the economy might evolve in the future more challenging than usual. In light of the significant uncertainty and downside risks associated with the course of the pan- demic and how long it would take the economy to re- cover, the staff still judged that a more pessimistic pro- jection was no less plausible than the baseline forecast. In this alternative scenario, an acceleration of the coro- navirus outbreak, with another round of strict limita- tions on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin later this year, leading to a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and re- newed downward pressure on inflation next year. Com- pared with the baseline, the disruption to economic ac- tivity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemploy- ment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projec- tion. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the coronavirus pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Follow- ing sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall financial condi- tions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus, which was seen as highly uncer- tain. Participants noted that the rebound in consumer spend- ing from its trough in April had been particularly strong. Resumption in economic activity, as well as payments to households under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Eco- nomic Security (CARES) Act, had supported household income and consumer expenditures. Participants ob- served that with this rebound, household spending likely had recovered about half of its previous decline. Con- sumers’ purchases of goods—including motor vehicles, other durables, and especially goods sold online—had bounced back much more than their purchases of ser- vices, such as air travel, hotel accommodations, and res- taurant meals, which were disrupted significantly by so- cial distancing and other effects of the virus. With re- gard to the behavior of household spending in recent weeks, participants pointed to information from District contacts and high-frequency indicators (such as credit and debit card transactions and mobility indicators based on cellphone location tracking) as suggesting that in- creases in some consumer expenditures had likely slowed in reaction to the further spread of the virus. Participants noted that households’ spending on discre- Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ tionary services—such as leisure, travel, and hospital- ity—would likely be subdued for some time and thus would be a factor restraining the pace of recovery. turn, such a reopening would depend in large part on the efficacy of health measures taken to limit the spread of the virus. In contrast to the sizable rebound in consumer spend- ing, participants saw less improvement in the business sector in recent months, and they noted that their Dis- trict business contacts continued to report extraordinar- ily high levels of uncertainty and risks. Several partici- pants relayed examples of some operational difficulties their business contacts were reportedly facing in the cur- rent environment. These difficulties included managing disruptions in supply chains, challenges associated with closure and reopening, and elevated employee absentee- ism in some cases. Furthermore, some participants noted that small businesses were under significant strain. Also, further near-term fiscal support was uncertain. Participants noted that, in light of conditions in the busi- ness sector, business investment spending continued to be subdued. Participants generally agreed that actions of consumers and businesses in taking steps to slow the spread of the virus, along with developments in public health, would be critical in ensuring a durable reopening of businesses. In addition, monetary policy and particu- larly fiscal policy would also play important roles in sup- porting business activity. Several participants also commented on ongoing chal- lenges facing the energy or farm sector despite recent improvements. In the energy sector, these challenges in- cluded still-low oil demand, excess inventories, and low oil prices, while in the farm sector they included low prices of some farm commodities, pandemic-related dis- ruptions in some food processing plants, and a signifi- cant decline in demand for ethanol. Regarding the labor market, many participants com- mented that the pace of employment gains, which was quite strong in May and June, had likely slowed. The increasing number of virus cases in many parts of the country had led to delays in some business reopenings and to some reclosures as well. The pace of declines in initial unemployment insurance claims had slowed in re- cent weeks, and claims remained at an elevated level. In addition, participants emphasized that the labor market was a long way from a full recovery even after the posi- tive May and June employment reports; these reports in- dicated that, through June, only about one-third of the roughly 22 million loss in jobs that occurred over March and April had been offset by subsequent gains. Partici- pants generally agreed that prospects for further sub- stantial improvement in the labor market would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses. In Participants also discussed the nature of the current sit- uation in the labor market. They noted that the down- turn in employment was concentrated among lower- wage and service-sector workers, many of whom were employed in industries most adversely affected by social- distancing measures. And with lower-wage and service- sector jobs disproportionately held by African Ameri- cans, Hispanics, and women, these portions of the pop- ulation were bearing a disproportionate share of the eco- nomic hardship caused by the pandemic. Participants noted that the fiscal support initiated in the spring through the CARES Act had been very important in granting some financial relief to millions of families. A number of participants observed that, with some provi- sions of the CARES Act set to expire shortly against the backdrop of a still-weak labor market, additional fiscal aid would likely be important for supporting vulnerable families, and thus the economy more broadly, in the pe- riod ahead. In their comments about inflation, participants generally judged that the negative effect of the pandemic on ag- gregate demand was more than offsetting upward pres- sures on some prices stemming from supply constraints or from higher demand for certain products, so that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was seen as dis- inflationary. Recent low monthly readings of PCE prices suggested that the 12-month change measure of PCE price inflation would likely continue to run well below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for some time. Against this backdrop, a few participants noted a risk that longer-term inflation expectations might move be- low levels consistent with the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective. Participants also noted that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy would likely be needed for some time to support aggregate demand and achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run. Participants observed that many measures of financial market functioning were indicating that improvements achieved since the extreme turbulence in March had been sustained. Actions by the Federal Reserve, includ- ing emergency lending facilities established with ap- proval of (and, in many cases, financial support from) the Treasury, had helped ease the strains in some finan- cial markets seen earlier in the year and were supporting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and com- munities. Participants observed that the volume of bor- _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020Page 9 rowing in recent months at many of the Federal Re- serve’s liquidity facilities had stayed low, reflecting im- proved availability of funding from market sources. And participants agreed that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing provision of backstop credit in various forms continued to be important to sustain the market improvements al- ready achieved. Participants observed that uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook remained very elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus and the public sector’s response to it. Several risks to the outlook were noted, including the possibility that additional waves of virus outbreaks could result in ex- tended economic disruptions and a protracted period of reduced economic activity. In such scenarios, banks and other lenders could tighten conditions in credit markets appreciably and restrain the availability of credit to households and businesses. Other risks cited included the possibility that fiscal support for households, busi- nesses, and state and local governments might not pro- vide sufficient relief of financial strains in these sectors and that some foreign economies could come under greater pressure than anticipated as a result of the spread of the pandemic abroad. Several participants noted po- tential longer-run effects of the pandemic associated with possible restructuring in some sectors of the econ- omy that could slow the growth of the economy’s pro- ductive capacity for some time. A number of participants commented on various poten- tial risks to financial stability. Banks and other financial institutions could come under significant stress, particu- larly if one of the more adverse scenarios regarding the spread of the virus and its effects on economic activity was realized. Nonfinancial corporations had carried high levels of indebtedness into the pandemic, increas- ing their risk of insolvency. There were also concerns that the anticipated increase in Treasury debt over the next few years could have implications for market func- tioning. There was general agreement that these institu- tions, activities, and markets should be monitored closely, and a few participants noted that improved data would be helpful for doing so. Several participants ob- served that the Federal Reserve had recently taken steps to help ensure that banks remain resilient through the pandemic, including by conducting additional sensitivity analysis in conjunction with the most recent bank stress tests and imposing temporary restrictions on share- holder payouts to preserve banks’ capital. A couple of participants noted that they believed that restrictions on shareholder payouts should be extended, while another judged that such a step would be premature. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed their commitment to using the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing its maximum employment and price stability goals. They noted that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the on- going public health crisis would weigh heavily on eco- nomic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic out- look over the medium term. In light of this assessment, all participants considered it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Furthermore, participants continued to judge that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered re- cent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Participants also judged that, in order to continue to sup- port the flow of credit to households and businesses, it would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed- eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and CMBS at least at the current pace. These actions would be helpful in sustaining smooth market functioning, thereby fostering the effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, participants noted that it was appropriate that the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Participants observed that it would be important to continue to monitor develop- ments closely and that the Committee would be pre- pared to adjust its plans as appropriate. Participants discussed the current stance of monetary policy and the circumstances under which they might in- crease monetary policy accommodation or clarify their intentions regarding policy. Participants generally judged that the Committee’s policy actions over the past several months had provided substantial accommoda- tion; several of them observed that the Committee’s as- set purchases, which were designed to support financial market functioning and the smooth flow of credit, were likely also providing a degree of policy accommodation. Noting the increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook over the intermeeting period, several partici- pants suggested that additional accommodation could be required to promote economic recovery and return in- flation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Some participants observed that, due to the nature of the shock that the U.S. economy was experiencing, strong Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ fiscal policy support would be necessary to encourage expeditious improvements in labor market conditions. With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, a number of participants noted that provid- ing greater clarity regarding the likely path of the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate at some point. Concerning the possible form that revised policy communications might take, these participants commented on outcome-based forward guidance—un- der which the Committee would undertake to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at least until one or more specified economic outcomes was achieved—and also touched on calendar-based forward guidance—under which the current target range would be maintained at least until a particular calendar date. In the context of outcome-based forward guidance, various participants mentioned using thresholds calibrated to in- flation outcomes, unemployment rate outcomes, or combinations of the two, as well as combinations with calendar-based guidance. In addition, many participants commented that it might become appropriate to frame communications regarding the Committee’s ongoing as- set purchases more in terms of their role in fostering ac- commodative financial conditions and supporting eco- nomic recovery. More broadly, in discussing the policy outlook, a number of participants observed that com- pleting a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy would be very helpful in providing an overarching framework that would help guide the Committee’s future policy actions and com- munications. A majority of participants commented on yield caps and targets—approaches that cap or target interest rates along the yield curve—as a monetary policy tool. Of those participants who discussed this option, most judged that yield caps and targets would likely provide only modest benefits in the current environment, as the Committee’s forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate already appeared highly credible and longer-term interest rates were already low. Many of these participants also pointed to potential costs associ- ated with yield caps and targets. Among these costs, par- ticipants noted the possibility of an excessively rapid ex- pansion of the balance sheet and difficulties in the design and communication of the conditions under which such a policy would be terminated, especially in conjunction with forward guidance regarding the policy rate. In light of these concerns, many participants judged that yield caps and targets were not warranted in the current envi- ronment but should remain an option that the Commit- tee could reassess in the future if circumstances changed markedly. A couple of participants remarked on the value of yield caps and targets as a means of reinforcing forward guidance on asset purchases, thereby providing insurance against adverse movements in market expec- tations regarding the path of monetary policy, and as a tool that could help limit the amount of asset purchases that the Committee would need to make in pursuing its dual-mandate goals. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was caus- ing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employment had picked up somewhat in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Con- sumer price inflation was being held down by weaker de- mand and significantly lower oil prices. Overall financial conditions had improved, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households, businesses, and communities. Mem- bers agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. Members stated that the path of the economy would de- pend significantly on the course of the virus. In addi- tion, members agreed that the ongoing public health cri- sis would weigh heavily on economic activity, employ- ment, and inflation in the near term and was posing con- siderable risks to the economic outlook over the me- dium term. In light of these developments, members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Members stated that they ex- pected to maintain this target range until they were con- fident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Members agreed that they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the eco- nomic outlook—including information related to public health—as well as global developments and muted infla- tion pressures, and that they would use the Committee’s tools and act as appropriate to support the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of monetary policy, members noted that they would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment ob- jective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment would take into account a wide range of _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 28–29, 2020Page 11 information, including measures of labor market condi- tions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and readings on financial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and busi- nesses, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency RMBS and CMBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar- ket functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, members agreed that the Desk would continue to offer large-scale overnight and term repo operations. Members noted that they would closely monitor devel- opments and be prepared to adjust their plans as appro- priate. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective July 30, 2020, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed secu- rities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar fund- ing markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-counter- party limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and all principal payments from holdings of agency CMBS in agency CMBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The coronavirus outbreak is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Following sharp declines, economic activity and employ- ment have picked up somewhat in recent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and sig- nificantly lower oil prices are holding down con- sumer price inflation. Overall financial condi- tions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the econ- omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on eco- nomic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of these developments, the Committee de- cided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered re- cent events and is on track to achieve its maxi- mum employment and price stability goals. The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook, including information re- lated to public health, as well as global develop- ments and muted inflation pressures, and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the economy. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the stance of mon- etary policy, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments. To support the flow of credit to households and businesses, over coming months the Federal Reserve will increase its holdings of Treasury se- curities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities at least at the cur- rent pace to sustain smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions. In addition, the Open Market Desk will con- tinue to offer large-scale overnight and term re- purchase agreement operations. The Commit- tee will closely monitor developments and is prepared to adjust its plans as appropriate.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Neel Kashkari, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective July 30, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, Septem- ber 15–16, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:55 a.m. on July 29, 2020. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on June 30, 2020, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on June 9–10, 2020. _______________________ James A.

Chair Powell: “Thomas was unquestionably one of the great economic minds of his generation, and his re- search has been central to some of our biggest discussions and policy actions over the past sev- eral years. He had a rare and underappreciated gift for translating arcane and academic theory into real world practice. That ability made a real difference in the conduct and communication of monetary policy. From his work on r*, to the balance sheet, to leading the steering committee for our monetary policy review, Thomas Lau- bach’s intellectual fingerprints are all over the Committee’s decisions that will define this era of the Federal Reserve. Thomas was also an exceptional colleague, leader, and friend. No one here will be sur- prised to know that as condolences pour in, the admiration for his kindness and equanimity match, if not exceed, the esteem for his intellect. Thomas was a model of leadership who fiercely believed that every member of his team is criti- cal to our collective success, and he made cer- tain they knew it. Even as he battled his own health problems, working through treatment to help fight the economic fallout of a global pan- demic, his concern lay with others. Amid a del- uge of emergency work to fight a historic down- turn and the upending of daily life, Thomas urged people to take care of themselves and their families first. It is a testament to the mu- tual respect and amity that it was Thomas’s team who proposed the Tealbook dedication in his memory. As friends, colleagues, and collaborators, we all grieve his loss. His absence leaves a space that cannot truly be filled. We will miss Thomas Laubach’s intellect and his insight. More im- portantly, we will miss Thomas Laubach.” Vice Chair Williams: “Thomas and I started working together 20 years ago. He had just arrived at the Board from the Kansas City Fed, and I had returned from my stint at the Council of Economic Ad- visers. And it was truly serendipitous. We im- mediately recognized the shared interest in fig- uring out how to estimate this thing called the Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ natural rate of interest. And more importantly, Thomas was an expert in Kalman filtering. So we were off to the races on that project. Ironi- cally, given subsequent events, the question of the time was whether the productivity boom had driven r* higher. In fact, if you go back to our December 2000 memo, our first memo to the Board on r*, our original estimates had r* at 4¼ percent, and that’s real, not nominal. So that’s a 6¼ percent nominal r*. Those were the days. Jumping ahead 15 years, following his appoint- ment as Director of Monetary Affairs, Thomas would frequently, and very earnestly, ask me how he could be most effective in his role as an adviser to the FOMC. And I’d remind him that the Committee has at times been compared to a herd of cats. But he was always looking for ways to raise his game, and hopefully ours, and help the Committee grapple with issues and de- cisions before us. Sometimes that effort led to briefings with a labyrinth of charts and figures, where Thomas heroically tried to make sense of our Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projections and the implicit policy rule that must be embedded in them if you only looked hard enough. Or it goes without saying how everything makes more sense once you factor in r*. His role as trusted adviser was never more on display or important than during the framework just commented. review as Chair Powell Thomas focused on making sure the Commit- tee was prepared with the very best information and analysis. He consistently moved us towards the goal line, even as he engaged in a complex range of issues and dealt with the effects of the pandemic. And he scrupulously played the role of honest broker throughout. Indeed, he per- fected the formula for herding cats. It’s one part keen intellect, a dollop of understated hu- mor, and a big helping of patience and persever- ance.” Governor Clarida: “Thomas Laubach was a remarkable human be- ing who just happened to be a world class econ- omist. His passing last week represents of course an incalculable loss for his family, but is also a devastating blow felt by each and every one of us in the Federal Reserve System, and indeed, in major central banks around the world that he frequently visited. Before I arrived at the Board, I knew Thomas primarily through his research. His book on in- flation targeting with Ben Bernanke, Rick Mish- kin, and Adam Posen is a classic reference on the subject, as is his work with President Wil- liams on r*. I would say Thomas had a talent for picking co-authors. Thomas and I first met when he was a Ph.D. student working on the book and we were both visiting the New York Fed. I remember well our first meeting 25 years ago, and I was struck then by Thomas’s enthusiasm that he brought to economics as a graduate stu- dent. Thomas of course never lost that spark and joy for the practice of monetary policy, and we are all fortunate that he did not. I—and I’m sure Chair Powell, and before him, Chair Yellen—trusted him implicitly. And speaking for myself, I always sought his insight and ad- vice privately in my office and counsel on all of the big policy decisions I’ve had to consider in my two years as Vice Chair. Thomas made everyone that he worked with better and inspired to put forth their best energy and effort to achieve larger goals. That was most certainly the case in the framework review, and I’ll second what Vice Chair Williams and Chair Powell said. Thomas brought peerless leadership, energy, and a commitment to the en- tire framework review. We simply would not have achieved the evolution of our framework and strategy without Thomas and the insight, inspiration, and good judgment he brought to the project and the ambitious process that he designed and worked with us to implement. I understand that in Thomas’s last days, he was able to watch the Chair’s speech at Jackson Hole rolling out the new framework, and that he was so proud to have been part of what the Wall Street Journal called a landmark change in U.S. monetary policy. I’m sure I speak for all of us when I conclude by saying that it is we who are proud to have had the privilege of working with Thomas Laubach during his 20 years at the Fed. He is and will be deeply missed, but his spirit and inspiration to us all will endure.” Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The System Open Market Account (SOMA) manager first discussed developments in financial markets. On net, financial conditions eased over the intermeeting pe- riod. Equity prices rose and the broad dollar continued to depreciate from its crisis-driven peak in March. Yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities fell, while longer-dated nominal Treasury yields increased modestly. Market participants attributed these developments to a stronger economic outlook, better news on the COVID- 19 trajectory, better-than-feared corporate earnings re- ports, and accommodative policy. Against this back- drop, most respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Sur- vey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partici- pants perceived downside risks to U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth this year as having declined no- tably since the July survey, and their forecasts for overall growth for 2020 were revised up significantly. While the economic outlook had brightened, market participants continued to see significant risks ahead. Some noted concerns about elevated asset valuations in certain sectors. Many also cited geopolitical events as heightening uncertainty. In addition, most forecasters were assuming that an additional pandemic-related fiscal package would be approved this year, and noted that, absent a new package, growth could decelerate at a faster-than-expected pace in the fourth quarter. In light of these and other risks, as well as the ongoing pan- demic, market participants continued to suggest that the supportive policy environment and the backstops to market functioning remained important stabilizers. The release of the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (consensus state- ment) elicited relatively modest immediate reaction across markets. However, market participants generally viewed the completion of the review as an important milestone; many indicated that growing expectations for the Committee to adopt a flexible average-inflation- targeting regime had influenced asset prices over recent months. In particular, these expectations were viewed as contributing to the recent rise in far-forward measures of inflation compensation, though market participants noted that these measures were still somewhat low by historical standards. Market participants continued to anticipate that the Committee would update its forward guidance for the federal funds rate. Most respondents to the Desk’s sur- veys continued to indicate that they expected the FOMC to adopt outcome-based forward guidance linked to in- flation; some noted that employment measures could be part of the forward guidance as well. Survey respond- ents’ expectations for the economic conditions that would prevail when the FOMC first lifted the target range had shifted notably since the previous survey, with many respondents projecting somewhat higher inflation and lower unemployment than in July. Expectations for asset purchases this year remained tightly centered around the current pace; however, many survey re- spondents revised up the amount of asset purchases ex- pected in 2021 and 2022. The manager turned next to a discussion of funding mar- ket conditions and open market operations over the pe- riod. Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets remained stable over the period. Overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade in narrow ranges near the interest on excess reserves rate. Forward measures of funding rates implied that conditions were expected to remain stable in coming months. to (MBS) continued Markets for Treasury securities and agency mortgage- backed securities function smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other in- dicators remaining near pre-pandemic levels. Indicators of functioning in the market for agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) also remained sta- ble. In light of the improved conditions, the staff pro- posed that the Desk no longer be required to increase agency CMBS holdings or reinvest principal payments for agency CMBS. For the time being, the Desk would continue to conduct regular agency CMBS operations to maintain backstop capacity. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the September 15–16 meeting suggested that U.S. real GDP was rebounding at a rapid rate in the third quarter. Labor market conditions con- tinued to improve markedly in July and August, but em- ployment was still below its level at the beginning of the year. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE) through July— Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ remained well below the rates that prevailed early in the year. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in July and August, although payrolls had retraced only about half of the jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate moved down further to 8.4 per- cent in August. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics declined over the past two months but remained well above the national aver- age. The labor force participation rate rose, on net, and the employment-to-population ratio increased further in July and August. Initial claims for unemployment insur- ance benefits continued to move down, on net, through early September, but the pace of declines had slowed. In addition, weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con- structed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains likely were still solid from mid-August to early Septem- ber. index (CPI) Total PCE price inflation was 1.0 percent over the 12 months ending in July, reflecting both weak aggregate demand and a considerable drop in consumer energy prices early this year. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.3 percent over the same 12-month period. By comparison, the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.8 percent in July. The consumer price increased 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 1.7 percent over the same period. On a monthly basis, recent inflation readings were bolstered by in- creases in durable goods prices, largely reflecting the strong demand for consumer goods as household pur- chases shifted away from many consumer services. The latest readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations moved up a bit but remained within their ranges in recent years. The University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years edged up in July and August, and the three- year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations also crept up over the past two months. Real PCE expanded strongly in July and continued to be bolstered by supportive fiscal and monetary policy ac- tions. In August, the components of retail sales used to estimate PCE, along with sales of light motor vehicles, increased further. However, recent high-frequency indi- cators of spending on some consumer services—such as restaurant dining, hotel accommodations, and air travel—were still subdued. Real disposable personal in- come was roughly flat in July, primarily reflecting further gains in wage and salary income that were largely offset by the waning of government transfer payments from their peak in the spring. Nevertheless, the personal sav- ing rate remained quite elevated. The consumer senti- ment measure from the Michigan survey edged up in August, while the Conference Board survey measure moved down; both measures continued to be below their levels at the beginning of the year. Housing-sector activity continued to expand, likely sup- ported by the effects of low interest rates. Starts and building permit issuance for single-family homes, along with starts of multifamily units, increased further in July. Sales of both new and existing homes also rose substan- tially further. These measures of construction and sales were generally at or near their pre-pandemic levels. Indicators of business fixed investment suggested that this sector was beginning to recover on balance. Nomi- nal new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased in July, the third con- secutive monthly increase in these indicators of business equipment spending. Many measures of business senti- ment also improved somewhat in July and August. In addition, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation through early September—an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and min- ing sector—had flattened out recently following its de- clines since the spring. In contrast, nominal business spending on nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined over June and July. Industrial production expanded further in July and Au- gust, although at a less rapid pace than over the preced- ing two months. The increase in factory output was broad based, but the gains for most manufacturing in- dustries had slowed gradually since June. Production in the mining sector—which includes crude oil and natural gas drilling and extraction—increased in July but fell in August, as Tropical Storm Marco and Hurricane Laura caused sharp but temporary decreases in extraction and drilling. Total real government purchases appeared to be increas- ing modestly, on balance, in the third quarter. Federal defense spending continued to rise through August, and federal employment was boosted markedly by temporary census-related hiring. State and local government pay- rolls expanded in July and August, although nominal state and local construction expenditures decreased in June and July. Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ After declining sharply earlier this year, exports and im- ports of goods and services increased strongly in June and July. On net, over these two months, the nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened, as imports rose more than exports. Exports and imports of goods rose in June and July in most major product categories, while exports and imports of services rose modestly following previous historic declines. Foreign economic activity plunged in the second quarter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associ- ated restrictive measures to contain it. With some of these measures having been rolled back in recent months, economic indicators pointed to a large, but par- tial, rebound in most foreign economies in the third quarter. Recent indicators of household and business spending were strong in several economies (including Canada, the euro area, and Brazil), reflecting in part a boost from substantial government support programs. In China, economic indicators showed a continued moderate expansion after a sharp rebound in the second quarter, though gains in consumption continued to lag those in production and exports. Similarly, in Mexico, a strong rebound in manufacturing production contrasted with weak services activity. Despite the widespread re- bound in foreign activity indicators, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in parts of Europe and Asia added un- certainty to the outlook for those economies. Recent readings of headline and core inflation abroad remained quite low, particularly in the advanced foreign econo- mies (AFEs), amid subdued demand pressures and lower energy prices from earlier this year. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment improved over the inter- meeting period, boosted by declines in the number of new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger- than-anticipated corporate earnings reports and domes- tic economic data releases. Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, despite notable declines late in the inter- meeting period. Inflation compensation increased fur- ther, reaching pre-pandemic levels. Changes in other as- set prices were generally more modest but were con- sistent with improved sentiment: The Treasury yield curve steepened a little, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately, and the ex- change value of the dollar depreciated modestly. Mean- while, financing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores remained broadly accommodative, although conditions remained tight for other borrowers. Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed since the July FOMC meeting, while 10- and 30-year yields rose moderately. Market commentary at- tributed the increases in longer-term yields to improved investor sentiment. This improved sentiment partly re- flected the decline in new COVID-19 cases in the United States and stronger-than-expected economic data, al- though market reactions to economic data releases were limited. The near-dated implied volatility on 10-year Treasury securities was little changed over the intermeet- ing period and remained near the bottom of its historical range. Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS maturing over the next few years continued to in- crease, likely reflecting the general improvement in in- vestor sentiment accompanying the improvement in the economic outlook, some further improvements in TIPS market liquidity, and the higher-than-expected July CPI data release. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation compensation were close to their pre-pandemic levels but were still in the lower end of their historical ranges. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the July FOMC meeting and remained close to the effective lower bound (ELB) through the first half of 2024. Com- munications about monetary policy over the intermeet- ing period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate. However, market participants suggested that building expectations that the Committee would move to a form of flexible average inflation targeting under the revised consensus statement had been a factor boosting TIPS inflation compensation over recent months. Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, during the inter- meeting period, consistent with generally better-than-ex- pected news on both the economy and second-quarter corporate earnings. One-month option-implied volatil- ity on the S&P 500—the VIX—was roughly unchanged, on net, although measures of longer-term downside risks in equity markets, such as the option-implied cost of in- suring against a 10 percent decline in the S&P 500 index in three months, increased somewhat. Spreads of invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed some- what and remained near their historical medians. Conditions in short-term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors changed little, on net, and remained Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ around levels observed before the pandemic. Total gross CP issuance also remained within pre-pandemic normal ranges, although outstanding volumes of nonfi- nancial CP declined moderately since the July FOMC meeting. Assets under management of prime and gov- ernment money market funds (MMFs) declined mod- estly on net. Partly reversing changes observed between April and July, institutional government MMFs, on net, decreased their holdings of Treasury securities and in- creased their holdings of repurchase agreements (repos) in August. The reversal was driven in part by a tighter spread between Treasury bill yields and repo rates. Amid normalizing market conditions, there was little activity in the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility or the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. The effective federal funds rate and the Secured Over- night Financing Rate averaged 9 basis points over the intermeeting period. The amount of Federal Reserve repo outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period due to more attractive rates in the private market. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as during the previous intermeeting period. Foreign asset price movements were generally muted, with market participants likely weighing concerns over rising infection rates in some countries against the pro- spect of a COVID-19 vaccine. In emerging market economies (EMEs), Asian equity markets significantly outperformed Latin American counterparts, with Chi- nese equities showing particular strength. In most AFEs, equity indexes rose modestly and long-term sov- ereign yields edged higher. In line with the modest improvement in risk sentiment, the staff’s broad dollar index declined moderately, on net, with the dollar depreciating more against EME cur- rencies. The Chinese renminbi was boosted by better- than-expected Chinese economic data and was the most notable contributor to the decline in the staff’s trade- weighted dollar index, along with the Mexican peso. Among AFE currencies, the euro appreciated further and reached its highest level against the dollar since 2018. The pound was little changed, as some of its ear- lier appreciation against the dollar unwound amid a re- surgence of Brexit-related uncertainty. Financing conditions in capital markets remained ac- commodative over the intermeeting period. Amid his- torically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds was strong in July and August. Much of this recent issu- ance was intended to refinance existing debt. Gross in- stitutional leveraged loan issuance picked up slightly in July but remained below the levels observed during the same period last year. Amid notable equity market gains in August, gross equity issuance was robust, as seasoned offerings strengthened to about double their typical pace. Commercial and industrial loans outstanding de- clined in July and August, but at a slower pace than in June, with declines in large part reflecting continued credit-line repayment. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations showed tentative signs of stabilization over the intermeeting pe- riod. The dollar volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades continued to exceed upgrades, albeit only modestly, representing a sizable reduction in net down- grades since the spring. The pace of nonfinancial cor- porate bond defaults in July was also notably lower than in April and May but was still elevated relative to pre- pandemic levels. Default volumes fell further in August, reaching a level below the 2019 monthly average. Mar- ket indicators of future default expectations also im- proved somewhat. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, although some indicators pointed to a slight im- provement. Thirty-day delinquency rates fell modestly between May and July but remained comparable with early 2008 levels. The credit needs of small businesses remained high, with significant shares of respondents to the Census Bureau’s Small Business Pulse Survey report- ing scarce cash availability and anticipating a need for fi- nancial assistance in the next six months. Municipal market financing conditions remained accom- modative since the July FOMC meeting. However, the credit quality of municipal debt deteriorated somewhat, driven by a relatively large volume of credit rating down- grades of revenue bonds. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) intermediated through capital markets recovered further over the intermeeting period. Spreads on triple-B non- agency CMBS remained wide, though they continued to narrow through August, while triple-A spreads remained close to pre-pandemic levels. Issuance of non-agency CMBS was steady but subdued relative to pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on agency CMBS were tight and issuance was very strong, setting a new single-month record in July. In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks was weak in July and August, likely partly driven by the recovery of CMBS markets. Delinquency rates on mortgages backing CMBS fell a bit in July but remained high in the hotel and retail sectors. Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. While mortgage rates hovered near historical lows, the spread between primary mortgage rates and MBS yields re- mained quite wide. Credit continued to flow to higher- score borrowers who met standard conforming loan cri- teria, while it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products. Nonetheless, low mortgage rates were supporting both home-purchase originations and refinancing. The credit quality of mortgages improved slightly, with the rate of transition remaining near pre- pandemic levels and forbearance continuing to slowly decline. into delinquency Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit scores but continued to be tight for sub- prime borrowers. Auto loan balances increased solidly overall but declined for borrowers with low credit scores. Credit card balances contracted at a slower rate in June and July than in the spring. However, offered interest rates rose and credit limits edged down for credit cards to nonprime borrowers. Conditions in the asset- backed securities (ABS) market were stable during the intermeeting period. ABS spreads edged down, and auto and student loan issuance was robust. Consumer credit performance remained stable, and the share of auto and credit card balances in forbearance declined. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate were faster over the second half of this year than in the July forecast, primarily reflecting recent better-than- expected data. In addition, the inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly, as some recent consumer goods prices were stronger than expected. Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to be subdued this year, reflecting substantial slack in resource utiliza- tion and the sizable declines in consumer energy prices earlier this year. Fiscal policy measures, along with the support from monetary policy and the Federal Reserve’s liquidity and lending facilities, were expected to continue supporting the second-half recovery, although the re- covery was forecast to be far from complete by year-end. The staff’s forecast assumed the enactment of some ad- ditional fiscal policy support this year; without that addi- tional policy action, the pace of the economic recovery would likely be slower. In the staff’s medium-term projection, the baseline as- sumptions included that the current restrictions on so- cial interactions and business operations, along with vol- untary social distancing by individuals and firms, would ease gradually through next year. In addition, the staff projection assumed that monetary policy would be even more accommodative than in the previous forecast in order to more fully reflect the revised consensus state- ment. Altogether, the rate of real GDP growth was pro- jected to exceed potential output growth, the unemploy- ment rate was expected to decline considerably further, and inflation was forecast to pick back up in 2021 through 2023. With the more-accommodative monetary policy assumed in the current forecast, which reflected the recent consensus statement, inflation was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023. The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty re- lated to the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic effects was extremely elevated and that the risks to the outlook were still tilted to the down- side. Given the apparent resilience of the U.S. economy to the acceleration in the spread of the pandemic during the summer, the staff judged that a significantly more pessimistic economic outcome, which the staff had pre- viously viewed as no less plausible than the baseline fore- cast and had featured a renewed downturn in economic activity, was now less likely than the baseline forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy—including the path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections repre- sented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the SEP, which is an addendum to these minutes. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Eco- nomic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the be- ginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ lower oil prices were holding down consumer price in- flation. Overall financial conditions had improved in re- cent months, in part reflecting policy measures to sup- port the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and infla- tion in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy’s medium-term outlook. Participants observed that the incoming data indicated that economic activity was recovering faster than ex- pected from its depressed second-quarter level, when much of the economy was shut down to stem the spread of the virus. In particular, with the reopening of many businesses and fewer people withdrawing from social in- teractions, consumer spending was rebounding sharply and appeared to have recovered about three-fourths of its earlier decline. Prior fiscal policy actions were seen as having supported the ability and willingness of house- holds to spend, although most participants expressed concern about the expiration of the enhanced unem- ployment insurance benefits from the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) and judged that additional fiscal relief would help sustain the recovery in household spending. Indeed, many par- ticipants noted that their economic outlook assumed ad- ditional fiscal support and that if future fiscal support was significantly smaller or arrived significantly later than they expected, the pace of the recovery could be slower than anticipated. Participants also viewed accom- modative monetary policy as contributing to gains in res- idential investment as well as consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durable goods. While partici- pants pointed to strength in consumers’ purchases of goods, especially those sold online, they noted that out- lays for services had been slower to recover, particularly for items such as air travel, hotel accommodations, and restaurant meals, which had been significantly disrupted by social-distancing measures. Participants generally ex- pected spending on these services to remain subdued for some time and thus to be a restraining factor on the pace of the recovery. A few participants raised the possibility that the unwinding of the large pool of household sav- ings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greater-than-anticipated momentum to consumption going forward. However, a couple of other participants judged that if this savings reflected reduced spending on in-person services by high-income consumers, it was un- likely to provide much momentum to future consump- tion. Participants noted that business investment, which had plummeted in the second quarter, appeared to have be- gun to turn around. They pointed to data showing gains in capital goods orders and shipments as well as im- proved business sentiment. A number of participants judged that low interest rates were supporting business investment. However, the recovery was viewed as une- venly distributed across industries. While many business contacts reported progress on adapting to the pandemic, others noted that industries that relied more on person- to-person interactions continued to struggle. Business contacts with ties to the motor vehicle or housing indus- tries indicated increased activity, while those closer to the aviation, hospitality, and nonresidential construction industries were not seeing much of a recovery. Contacts continued to report ongoing stresses in the energy sec- tor, as well as challenges in the agricultural sector even though some crop prices had risen recently as sales to China increased. Although business contacts indicated that overall busi- ness activity had been stronger than they expected, it re- mained well below pre-pandemic levels. Business con- tacts pointed to several factors that could restrain further recovery, including high levels of uncertainty that were reportedly still holding back hiring and capital spending. Some contacts reported difficulties in managing disrup- tions in supply chains as well as elevated levels of em- ployee absenteeism because of the pandemic. Addition- ally, District contacts indicated that fiscal policy had helped support small businesses, while federal aid pay- ments had helped support farm incomes. Participants observed that labor market conditions con- tinued to improve in recent months and that the econ- omy through August had regained roughly half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in March and April. The gains in employment over July and August were gener- ally seen as larger than anticipated. Participants judged, however, that the labor market was a long way from be- ing fully recovered. They generally agreed that prospects for a further substantial improvement in the labor mar- ket would depend on a broad and sustained reopening of businesses, which in turn would depend importantly on how safe individuals felt to reengage in a wide range of activities. Some participants noted that the majority of gains in employment so far reflected workers on tem- porary layoffs returning to work. These participants judged it as less likely for future job gains to continue at their recent pace, because a greater share of the remain- ing layoffs might become permanent. Workers facing permanent layoffs were seen as more likely to need to find new jobs in different industries, and this process Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ could take time, especially to the extent that these work- ers needed to be retrained. Participants observed that lower-paid workers had been disproportionally affected by the economic effects of the pandemic. Many of these workers were employed in the service sector or other industries most adversely affected by social-distancing measures. With a disproportionate share of service-sector jobs held by African Americans, Hispanics, and women, these groups were seen as being especially hard hit by the economic hardships caused by the pandemic. Participants viewed fiscal support from the CARES Act as having been very important in bol- stering the financial situations of millions of families, and a number of participants judged that the absence of fur- ther fiscal support would exacerbate economic hard- ships in minority and lower-income communities. In ad- dition, several participants observed that the effects of the pandemic were disrupting the supply of labor be- cause of the need to care for children, many of whom were attending school virtually from home. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months and that market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased mod- erately over the intermeeting period, although they re- mained low. The upturn in consumer prices was primar- ily attributed to price increases in sectors such as con- sumer durables in which demand had risen after experi- encing a large decline earlier this spring. Nevertheless, inflation remained subdued, and participants still gener- ally judged that the overall effect of the pandemic on prices was disinflationary. While the outlook for infla- tion was viewed as highly uncertain, a number of partic- ipants projected that inflation would run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective for a signif- icant period before moving moderately above 2 percent for some time—consistent with the Committee’s revised consensus statement. Participants noted that financial conditions were gener- ally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Re- serve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities in conjunction with the Treasury, were support- ing the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. While these actions as well as prompt and forceful monetary policy measures in response to the pandemic were viewed as contributing to accommoda- tive financial conditions, participants noted important differences in credit quality and credit availability across borrowers. While the pace of corporate downgrades was seen as having decreased significantly in recent months, the delinquency rates on business loans had risen notice- ably. Bank contacts reported ample capacity to lend to creditworthy borrowers; however, surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending was tight. Fur- thermore, several participants noted the stress that small- and medium-sized banks could face from defaults on loans to small businesses and CRE properties if peo- ple continued to withdraw from travel and shopping ac- tivities. Additionally, a couple of participants indicated that highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking and to a buildup of financial imbalances. Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround- ing the economic outlook as very elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it. Participants cited several down- side risks that could threaten the recovery. While the risk of another broad economic shutdown was seen as having receded, participants remained concerned about the possibility of additional virus outbreaks that could undermine the recovery. Such scenarios could result in increases in bankruptcies and defaults, put stress on the financial system, and lead to disruptions in the flow of credit to households and businesses. Most participants raised the concern that fiscal support so far for house- holds, businesses, and state and local governments might not provide sufficient relief to these sectors. A couple of participants saw an upside risk that further fiscal stim- ulus could be larger than anticipated, though it might come later than had been expected. Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employ- ment growth or could accelerate technological disrup- tion that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that they were committed to us- ing the Federal Reserve’s full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. They also noted that the path of the economy would depend sig- nificantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on eco- nomic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic out- look over the medium term. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ All participants agreed that the completion of the frame- work review and the publication of the revised consen- sus statement provided a strong foundation for mone- tary policy decisions and communications going for- ward. Accordingly, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to incorporate some key elements of the re- vised consensus statement into the FOMC statement to be released following this meeting. In particular, partic- ipants reiterated their commitment to achieve maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below its longer-run goal, participants judged that it would be ap- propriate to aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation would average 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions would remain well anchored at 2 percent. Against this backdrop, participants discussed a range of issues associated with providing greater clarity about the likely path of the federal funds rate in the years ahead. Most participants supported providing more explicit outcome-based forward guidance for the federal funds rate that included establishing criteria for lifting the fed- eral funds rate above the ELB in terms of the paths for employment or inflation or both. Among the partici- pants who favored providing more explicit forward guidance at this meeting, all but a couple supported a formulation in which the forward guidance included lan- guage indicating that it would likely be appropriate to maintain the current target range until labor market con- ditions were judged to be consistent with the Commit- tee’s assessments of maximum employment and infla- tion had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moder- ately exceed 2 percent for some time. These participants noted that communicating that the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at the ELB until these criteria were achieved would provide appropriately clear and strong policy guidance. Doing so at this meeting was viewed as an especially important way of affirming the Committee’s commitment to achieving the eco- nomic outcomes articulated in the consensus statement. Participants generally noted that outcome-based for- ward guidance for the federal funds rate of this type was not an unconditional commitment to a particular path. Indeed, outcome-based guidance of this type would al- low the public to infer changes in the Committee’s as- sessment of how long the target range for the federal funds rate would remain at its current setting. Infor- mation pointing to a weaker outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to public expectations for a longer period at the current setting of the target range while information suggesting a stronger outlook for the economy and inflation would tend to lead to ex- pectations for a shorter period at the current setting. In addition, circumstances could arise in which the Com- mittee judged that it would be appropriate to change its guidance, particularly if risks emerged that could impede the attainment of its economic objectives. A couple of participants preferred even stronger, and less qualified, outcome-based forward guidance that they judged would more clearly convey the Committee’s commitment to its objectives and to the strategic ap- proach that was articulated in the revised consensus statement. In particular, these participants preferred for- ward guidance in which the target range for the federal funds rate remained at the ELB until inflation had moved above 2 percent for some time. Especially in light of the lengthy period in which inflation has run be- low the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, these participants judged that it was critical to demon- strate the Committee’s commitment to achieve out- comes in which inflation averages 2 percent over time. Several participants noted that while they agreed it was appropriate to incorporate key elements of the consen- sus statement into the postmeeting statement, they pre- ferred to retain forward guidance similar to that pro- vided in recent FOMC statements. These participants judged that it would likely be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of policy for some time in order to foster outcomes consistent with the Committee’s re- vised consensus statement. However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields. Moreover, these partici- pants were concerned that forward guidance that in- volved the target range for the federal funds rate remain- ing at the ELB until employment and inflation criteria were achieved could limit the Committee’s flexibility for years. Furthermore, by influencing expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, such guidance could contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances that would make it more difficult for the Committee to achieve its objectives in the future. Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed- eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS at least at the current pace. These actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and would continue to help foster accom- modative financial conditions, thereby supporting the Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ flow of credit to households and businesses. Some par- ticipants also noted that in future meetings it would be appropriate to further assess and communicate how the Committee’s asset purchase program could best support the Committee’s maximum- the achievement of employment and price-stability goals. Participants widely echoed the remarks at the opening of the meeting in memory of Thomas Laubach. Partici- pants universally recognized his great leadership and in- tellectual contributions to the work of the Committee as well as his warm and generous spirit. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had picked up in recent months but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation. Overall, financial con- ditions had improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-em- ployment and price-stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. All members agreed to incorporate into the postmeeting statement key elements of the Committee’s revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Members judged that this action would under- score the Committee’s strong commitment to the goals and strategy articulated in the new consensus statement in pursuit of the Committee’s statutory objectives. Ac- cordingly, members agreed that the FOMC statement should note that the Committee seeks to achieve maxi- mum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and that, with inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well an- chored at 2 percent. Members generally expected that it would be appropriate to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. Almost all members viewed this meeting as the appropriate time to modify forward guidance to provide greater clarity regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate. To this end, almost all members agreed on a specification for out- come-based forward guidance that indicated that the Committee expects that it will be appropriate to main- tain the current setting of the target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions had reached lev- els consistent with the Committee’s assessments of max- imum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to run moderately in excess of 2 per- cent for some time. Two members dissented from the policy decision. One of these dissenting members pre- ferred that the Committee retain greater policy rate flex- ibility by retaining the language in the forward guidance provided in the July postmeeting statement; that lan- guage noted that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee was confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. The other dissenting member preferred a stronger formulation for the forward guidance—one in which the Committee would indicate that it expected to maintain the current target range until core inflation had reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members generally agreed that the Committee’s policy guidance expressed its assessment about the path for the federal funds rate most likely to be consistent with achievement of the Committee’s goals, but that it was not an unconditional commitment. They stated that the appropriate rate path would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook. Accordingly, they agreed that the Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in assessing the appro- priate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pres- sures and inflation expectations, and financial and inter- national developments. Members noted that the Committee’s asset purchases had helped foster significant improvements in market functioning over recent months. In addition, purchases Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ of securities were contributing to accommodative finan- cial conditions in a way that supported economic recov- ery. Consistent with these observations, members agreed that it would be appropriate to acknowledge in the postmeeting statement the role of asset purchases in supporting accommodative financial conditions. The Committee’s statement thus indicated that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar- ket functioning and to help foster accommodative finan- cial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members considered the staff proposal to eliminate the requirement in the directive to increase the holdings of agency CMBS in the SOMA portfolio. In light of the substantial improvement in market functioning in the agency CMBS market, the Committee judged that it would be appropriate for the Desk to purchase agency CMBS only as needed to sustain smooth market func- tioning, rather than seek to steadily increase agency CMBS holdings, and to cease reinvestments of agency CMBS principal payments. Members also concluded that, in light of ongoing low take-up at Desk repo oper- ations, it was not necessary to include a sentence on these operations in the FOMC statement. However, the directive adopted by the Committee continued to direct the Desk to conduct overnight and term repo operations to support effective policy implementation and smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 17, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the current pace. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by ad- ditional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth func- tioning of markets for these securities. • Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set- tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have picked up in re- cent months but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions have improved in recent months, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. house- holds and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. Minutes of the Meeting of September 15–16, 2020Page 13_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Com- mittee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and in- flation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, over coming months the Federal Re- serve will increase its holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency mortgage-backed securities at least at the current pace to sustain smooth mar- ket functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international de- velopments.” Voting against this action: Robert S. Kaplan and Neel Kashkari. President Kaplan dissented because he expects that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range until the Committee is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals as artic- ulated in its new policy strategy statement, but prefers that the Committee retain greater policy rate flexibility beyond that point. President Kashkari dissented be- cause he prefers that the Committee indicate that it ex- pects to maintain the current target range until core in- flation has reached 2 percent on a sustained basis. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective Sep- tember 17, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, November 4– 5, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m. on Sep- tember 16, 2020. Notation Votes By notation vote completed on August 18, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 28–29, 2020. By notation vote completed on August 27, 2020, the Committee unanimously approved updates to its State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy. In conjunction with the notation vote, all non- voting participants also expressed support for the up- dated statement. Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Patrick Harker, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary Page 14Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 15–16, 2020, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2020 to 2023 and over the longer run. Each participant’s projections were based on infor- mation available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy— including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer- run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projec- tions represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to con- verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.1 “Ap- propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos- ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. The current projections for real activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation were notably stronger than the projec- tions in the June 2020 Summary of Economic Projec- tions (SEP) for the overlapping years from 2020 to 2022. Participants revised up their economic outlook in light of the stronger-than-expected rebound in economic ac- tivity over recent months, although they noted that they remained attentive to the effects of the COVID-19 pan- demic and the measures taken to contain it. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. Almost all participants projected that real GDP will con- tract in 2020, with the median participant seeing a milder contraction relative to the median projection in the June SEP. Additionally, almost all participants projected that real GDP would grow faster than their estimates of its longer-run normal growth rate from 2021 to 2023. All participants projected that the unemployment rate in the final quarter of 2020 would be notably lower than they had projected in June and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually during the forecast period. Most participants expected that a full economic recovery would take some time, and many projected that the un- employment rate in the final quarter of 2023 would be 1 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate. slightly below its estimated longer-run level. A vast ma- jority of participants projected that total inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would be at or below the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run inflation objective throughout the forecast period. Pro- jections for core PCE price inflation, which excludes consumer food and energy prices, generally followed a similar trajectory. to relative As shown in figure 2, most participants indicated that their expectations regarding the evolution of the econ- omy, the Committee’s maximum- employment and price-stability objectives, would likely warrant keeping the federal funds rate at its current level through at least the end of 2023. The median of partic- ipants’ assessments of the longer-run level for the federal funds rate was unchanged from its value in the June SEP. Amid uncertainty about the course of the pandemic and its effects on the economy, all participants continued to regard the uncertainties surrounding the economic out- look as higher than the average over the past 20 years. In addition, a substantial majority of participants as- sessed the risks to their outlook for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unem- ployment rate projections as weighted to the upside. The risks to inflation projections were judged as weighted to the downside by a substantial majority of participants. The Outlook for Real GDP Growth and the Unem- ployment Rate As shown in figure 3.A, almost all participants continued to project that real GDP would decline in 2020, with the median projection anticipating a decrease of 3.7 percent. Nevertheless, these projections were substantially stronger than those from the June SEP, when the me- dian participant expected real GDP to contract 6.5 per- cent. These revisions, in part, reflect the stronger-than- expected incoming data since June. Almost all partici- pants expected that the rate of real GDP growth from 2021 to 2023 would be above their estimates of its longer-run pace, with the median projections being 4.0 percent, 3.0 percent, and 2.5 percent in these years, respectively.

PCE inﬂation and core PCE inﬂation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant’s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the speciﬁed calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 9–10, 2020. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the June 9–10, 2020, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the September 15–16, 2020, meeting. 1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections. 2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year. 3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants’ projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year. 4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inﬂation are not collected.

Reflecting better-than-expected incoming data since June, participants revised down their projections for the unemployment rate considerably through 2022, the fore- cast period in the June SEP (figure 3.B). The projections for the unemployment rate in the final quarter of this year ranged from 6.5 to 8.0 percent, with a median of 7.6 percent, and the ranges for projections from 2020 to 2022 all narrowed considerably since June. The median projected levels of the unemployment rate in the final quarters of 2021 and 2022—at 5.5 percent and 4.6 per- cent, respectively—were above the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment of 4.1 per- cent. However, the median projection of the unemploy- ment rate in the final quarter of 2023, at 4.0 percent, was slightly below the median estimate of its longer-run value. The distribution of estimates for the longer-run unem- ployment rate was unchanged from the June SEP. Many participants indicated that they were still assessing whether the sharp contraction in economic activity dur- ing the first half of this year was likely to leave a lasting imprint on the labor market or the productive capacity of the economy. The Outlook for Inflation As shown in figures 3.C and 3.D, almost all participants revised up their projections for inflation in 2020 relative to their June projections, with the median projections for total and core inflation at 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. Most participants expected inflation to rise over the next three years, although about half of them expected PCE price inflation to still fall short of the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective by the end of the forecast horizon. A few participants pro- jected inflation to move above 2 percent before return- ing to 2 percent by 2023. A few participants expected inflation to move above its longer-run level in 2023, and several participants mentioned that they would expect inflation to rise above 2 percent in the years after. Appropriate Monetary Policy As shown in figure 3.E, most participants projected that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent through at least the end of 2023. Most participants noted that their as- sessment of appropriate monetary policy took into ac- count the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. In particular, because infla- tion has been running persistently below 2 percent, par- ticipants mentioned that they linked their assessment of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate to their assessment of shortfalls of employment from the Com- mittee’s maximum-employment objective and to a mod- erate rise in inflation above 2 percent to help anchor in- flation expectations at the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run goal. The median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was unchanged from June at 2.50 percent. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path for monetary policy, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur. As shown in the panels on the left side of figure 4, almost all participants continued to view the current uncertainty surrounding each of the four economic variables—real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total PCE infla- tion, and core PCE inflation—as being greater than the average over the past 20 years.2 A substantial majority of participants judged the risks to their projections for real GDP growth as weighted to the downside and the risks to their unemployment rate pro- jections as weighted to the upside (figure 4). A substan- tial majority of participants viewed the risks to their in- flation projections as weighted to the downside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, the course of the pandemic con- tinued to be mentioned as a key source of uncertainty. The possibility of another wave of contagion and delays in developing a vaccine were seen as potential downside risks to the economic outlook. As for upside risks, par- ticipants mentioned the possibility of faster-than- 2 As a reference, table 2 provides estimates of the forecast un- certainty for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, and total consumer price inflation over the period from 2000 through 2019. At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of un- certainty in the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending participants’ projections. Previous SEP addendums to the FOMC minutes contained figures showing the median projections along with confidence intervals based on historical forecast errors. As the level of uncertainty about the economic outlook is currently judged to be higher than its historical average because of uncertainty about the course of the coronavirus and its effects on the economy, these “fan charts” have been omitted from this ad- dendum.

Partic- ipants also pointed to a number of other risks, including the extent and timing of additional fiscal support, the magnitude of supply-side disruptions associated with postponements of in-class school openings and small business closings, the likelihood of elevated levels of business bankruptcies, and credit quality problems that could potentially curtail lending. Several participants also expressed concerns about global geopolitical devel- opments and related tensions as well as prolonged reces- sionary dynamics such as labor market scarring or infla- tion persistently undershooting the Committee’s longer- run goal. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts monetary policy in response to actual and prospective develop- ments over time in key economic variables—such as real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation— uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the fed- eral funds rate importantly reflects the uncertainties about the paths for these economic variables, along with other factors. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial. Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presi- dents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discus- sions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce eco- nomic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descrip- tions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen de- velopments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic out- come as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the econ- omy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accu- racy of a range of forecasts, including those re- ported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those pre- pared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in ad- vance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross do- mestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attend- ing those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.9 to 4.1 percent in the current year, 1.3 to 4.7 percent in the second year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the third year, and 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the fourth year. The cor- responding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the fourth year. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty at- tached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typ- ical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2. That is, participants judge whether each eco- nomic variable is more likely to be above or below their projections of the most likely outcome. These judgments about the uncertainty and the risks attend- ing each participant’s projections are distinct from the diversity of participants’ views about the most likely outcomes. Forecast uncertainty is concerned with the risks associated with a particular projection rather than with divergences across a number of different projections. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncer- tainty arises primarily because each participant’s as- sessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in ta- ble 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short- term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the fed- eral funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of- year basis. However, the forecast errors should pro- vide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as addi- tional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

Fi- nancial conditions were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period and remained accommodative. Market participants suggested that evolving expectations for U.S. fiscal policy as well as stronger-than-expected economic data and corporate earnings reports helped support equity prices. Later in the intermeeting period, however, rising COVID-19 cases in Europe and the United States weighed on the outlook, and equity prices reversed some of their earlier gains. Implied volatility in the equity market moved higher during the intermeeting period, reflecting uncertainties associated with the U.S. election and the future path of fiscal policy as well as concerns about the trajectory of COVID-19 cases. Market participants’ expectations for the path of the fed- eral funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period. In the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, respondents’ views on when the Committee will most likely start rais- ing the target range for the federal funds rate were cen- tered around 2024. Expectations for the economic con- ditions that will prevail when the FOMC first lifts the target range were little changed since the September sur- veys. Respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally expected the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to con- tinue at the current pace through the end of 2021 and then to slow in subsequent years, although there was a wide range of views about purchase amounts for 2022 and 2023. Market participants appeared increasingly fo- cused on how the Committee’s communications on as- set purchases might evolve. They expected those com- munications to place a greater emphasis on fostering ac- commodative financial conditions, and many noted the possibility that at some point the Committee might con- vey additional guidance about the future path of asset purchases. Some market participants expected the Com- mittee to eventually lengthen the weighted average ma- turity of the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury se- curities. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The manager turned next to a discussion of financial market functioning, open market operations, and condi- tions in short-term funding markets. Markets for Treas- ury securities and agency MBS continued to function smoothly, with bid-ask spreads and a range of other mar- ket functioning indicators remaining near pre-pandemic levels. Weekly operations continued for agency com- mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), with the Desk purchasing only modest amounts. Short-term dol- lar funding markets also continued to function smoothly over the period, and forward measures of funding rates were consistent with expectations for calm conditions over year-end. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased modestly over the intermeeting period to $7.2 trillion, as growth in securities holdings was partially offset by a decline in U.S. dollar liquidity swaps outstanding. Outstanding balances for credit and liquidity facilities were little changed. The manager noted that market participants continued to view these facilities as important backstops that would support market functioning and the flow of credit should stresses reemerge. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Discussion on Asset Purchases Participants discussed the FOMC’s asset purchases, in- cluding the role they are playing in supporting the Com- mittee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In their discussions, participants focused on the objec- tives of these purchases; considerations for assessing the appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases over time; communications regarding the future path of asset purchases; and the potential effects of higher levels of reserves, associated with the ongoing expansion in Federal Reserve asset holdings, on banks’ balance sheets and money market rates. Participants agreed that this discussion would be helpful for future assessments of the appropriate structure of the Committee’s asset pur- chases. While participants judged that immediate adjust- ments to the pace and composition of asset purchases were not necessary, they recognized that circumstances could shift to warrant such adjustments. Accordingly, participants saw the ongoing careful consideration of potential next steps for enhancing the Committee’s guid- ance for its asset purchases as appropriate. The participants’ discussion was preceded by staff presentations. The staff reviewed some key considera- tions relevant for conducting asset purchases in the cur- rent environment. The staff judged that the Commit- tee’s forward guidance on the federal funds rate, the ex- pansion of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings since March, and expectations for a further expansion all had contributed to a very low level of longer-term yields despite substantial Treasury debt issuance. The staff noted that financial market participants generally ex- pected the Committee to continue its net asset purchases at the current pace through next year and at a reduced pace in subsequent years. The staff discussed various changes the Committee could make to the structure of its purchases, including to their pace and composition as well as to the guidance the Committee has been provid- ing to the public about its future asset purchases. The staff discussed the structure of asset purchase programs of several foreign central banks and how they have evolved during the pandemic. Finally, the staff evaluated how higher levels of reserves associated with the ongo- ing expansion in the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings might influence banks’ balance sheets and money market rates and discussed the various tools that the Federal Re- serve has for managing money market rates in an envi- ronment with very high levels of reserves. In their discussion regarding the role of the Committee’s asset purchases, participants noted that these purchases have supported and sustained smooth market function- ing and helped foster accommodative financial condi- tions. With market functioning seen as having largely recovered, many participants indicated that the role of asset purchases had shifted more toward fostering ac- commodative financial conditions for households and businesses to support the Committee’s employment and inflation goals. Still, participants generally judged that asset purchases would continue to support smooth mar- ket functioning, and many judged that asset purchases helped provide insurance against risks that might reemerge in financial markets in an environment of high uncertainty. A few participants indicated that asset pur- chases could also help guard against undesirable upward pressure on longer-term rates that could arise, for exam- ple, from higher-than-expected Treasury debt issuance. Several participants noted the possibility that there may be limits to the amount of additional accommodation that could be provided through increases in the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings in light of the low level of longer-term yields, and they expressed concerns that a significant expansion in asset holdings could have unin- tended consequences. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 3 Participants commented on considerations related to the appropriate pace and composition of asset purchases. Participants generally saw the current pace and compo- sition as effective in fostering accommodative financial conditions. Participants noted that the Committee could provide more accommodation, if appropriate, by in- creasing the pace of purchases or by shifting its Treasury purchases to those with a longer maturity without in- creasing the size of its purchases. Alternatively, the Committee could provide more accommodation, if ap- propriate, by conducting purchases of the same pace and composition over a longer horizon. Pointing to the re- cently announced change in the Bank of Canada’s asset purchase program, several participants judged that the Committee could maintain its current degree of accom- modation by lengthening the maturity of the Commit- tee’s Treasury purchases while reducing the pace of pur- chases somewhat. In their view, such a change in the Committee’s purchase structure would have to be care- fully communicated to the public to avoid the misper- ception that the reduced pace of purchases represented a decline in the degree of accommodation. A few par- ticipants expressed concern that maintaining the current pace of agency MBS purchases could contribute to po- tential valuation pressures in housing markets. The September FOMC statement indicated that asset purchases will continue “over coming months,” and par- ticipants viewed this guidance for asset purchases as hav- ing served the Committee well so far. Most participants judged that the Committee should update this guidance at some point and implement qualitative outcome-based guidance that links the horizon over which the Commit- tee anticipates it would be conducting asset purchases to economic conditions. These participants indicated that updating the Committee’s guidance for asset purchases in this manner would help keep the market’s expectation for future asset purchases aligned with the Committee’s intentions. Some of these participants also saw such up- dated guidance as reinforcing the Committee’s commit- ment to fostering outcomes consistent with maximum employment and inflation that averages 2 percent over time. A few participants were hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guidance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable uncertainty about the economic outlook and the appropriate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty. Participants noted that it would be important for the Committee’s guidance for future asset purchases to be consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance for the federal funds rate so that the use of these tools would be well coordinated in terms of achieving the Commit- tee’s objectives. Most participants judged that the guid- ance for asset purchases should imply that increases in the Committee’s securities holdings would taper and cease sometime before the Committee would begin to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. A num- ber of participants highlighted the view that after net purchases cease there would likely be a period of time in which maturing assets would be reinvested to roughly maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings. Participants commented on how a higher level of re- serves associated with the expansion in the Federal Re- serve’s asset holdings might affect the banking sector and money markets. A few participants raised concerns about the possibility that much higher levels of reserves might create pressure on banks’ balance sheets, includ- ing on regulatory ratios, or could potentially put undue downward pressure on money market rates. Most par- ticipants judged that the Federal Reserve had effective tools to address these circumstances. Some participants noted that, if needed, the Federal Reserve could consider various steps to manage the levels of short-term interest rates and the quantity of reserves, such as adjusting ad- ministered rates, expanding the overnight reverse repur- chase agreement program, or implementing a maturity extension program. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The coronavirus pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activity The in the United States and abroad. information available at the time of the November 4–5 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) had rebounded at a rapid rate in the third quarter but remained well below its level at the start of the year. in Labor market conditions September, although the pace of gains eased and employment continued to be well below its level at the beginning of the year. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) through September—had returned to its year- earlier pace but remained noticeably below the rates that were posted in January and February. improved further Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded strongly in September, but the gain was markedly below the even larger increases seen in previous months. Through Sep- tember, payroll employment had retraced only about half of the decline seen at the onset of the pandemic. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The unemployment rate moved down further to 7.9 per- cent in September. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Asians both decreased, but the unem- ployment rate for Hispanics was little changed, and each group’s rate remained well above the national average. In addition, the overall labor force participation rate de- clined, and the employment-to-population ratio rose only slightly. Initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to move lower, on net, through late October, and weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls con- structed by the Board’s staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that employment gains from mid-September to mid-October remained solid. The employment cost index (ECI) for total hourly labor compensation in the private sector, which likely had been less influenced than other hourly compensation measures by the concentration of recent job losses among lower-wage workers, rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September. This gain was a little smaller than the index’s year-earlier 12-month change; in addition, the 3-month changes in the ECI in June and September were noticeably below the average pace seen over the period from 2017 through 2019. Total PCE price inflation was 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in September and continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.5 percent over the same period, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.9 percent in September. On a monthly basis, in- flation was a little lower in September, largely reflecting slower goods price inflation. The latest readings on sur- vey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations moved lower, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in October, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years fell back to the level that pre- vailed in early 2020, while in September the 3-year-ahead measure from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York retraced its August increase. Real PCE rose strongly in the third quarter, though the increase was not sufficient to return consumer spending to its pre-pandemic level. Real disposable personal in- come declined, reflecting a large reduction in govern- ment transfer payments. As a result, the personal saving rate moved sharply lower, though it was still elevated rel- ative to its 2019 average. The consumer sentiment measures from the Michigan survey and the Conference Board had moved higher, on net, since August; although both indexes stood above their April troughs, they re- mained well below their levels at the start of the year. Housing-sector activity advanced in the third quarter, with real residential investment and home sales both moving above their first-quarter levels. Activity in this sector was likely being supported by low interest rates, the sector’s ability to adjust business practices in re- sponse to social distancing, and pent-up demand follow- ing the widespread shutdowns earlier in the year. Business fixed investment expanded strongly, led by an outsized increase in third-quarter equipment spending. By contrast, spending on nonresidential structures con- tinued to move lower and was likely restrained by firms’ hesitation to commit to projects with lengthy times to completion and uncertain future returns as well as by the effect of lower oil prices on drilling investment. Growth in both total industrial production and manu- facturing output turned negative in September after hav- ing slowed markedly in August. Part of the softness in manufacturing production appeared to be attributable to pandemic-related delays in the motor vehicle industry’s model-year changeover, though subdued foreign de- mand and weaker demand from domestic energy pro- ducers were also likely acting to restrain factory output. As of September, manufacturing output had recovered roughly two-thirds of the drop seen earlier in the year. Total real government purchases declined in the third quarter. Federal nondefense purchases fell especially sharply, largely reflecting a step-down in lender pro- cessing fees associated with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). In addition, real purchases by state and local governments declined further. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in September after widening in August. Both exports and imports continued to rebound from their collapse in the first half of the year. Goods imports fully recovered to their January level, with broad-based increases in August and September. In contrast, goods exports by Septem- ber recovered only two-thirds of their decline since Jan- uary despite brisk growth in exports of agricultural prod- ucts and industrial supplies. Services trade remained de- pressed, driven by the continued suspension of most in- ternational travel. Altogether, net exports made a sub- stantial negative contribution to real GDP growth in the third quarter. Economic activity abroad rebounded sharply in the third quarter following a rollback of pandemic-related re- strictions. GDP levels, however, generally remained well _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 5 below their pre-pandemic peaks, with China being a no- table exception. Domestic demand supported the re- covery, and in Asia there was also a strong rebound of exports, especially of electronics and, more recently, au- tos. Third-quarter growth was particularly rapid in those economies that experienced some of the deepest con- tractions in the second quarter, including France, Italy, and Spain among the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and Mexico among the emerging market econo- mies. After falling through the end of the summer in many countries, inflation rates started to rise over the past two months but remained well below rates from early in the year. The rapid increase over recent weeks of new COVID-19 cases in several AFEs, especially in Europe, prompted governments to reintroduce restrictions to rein in this renewed wave of infections. In late October, the gov- ernments of several European countries—including England, France, and Germany—announced new na- tionwide restrictions (including the closures of bars and restaurants) and, in some cases, restrictions to the mo- bility of individuals within and across regions. Still, rel- ative to the spring, restrictions were noticeably less se- vere; factories, most businesses, and schools generally remained open. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment was little changed over the intermeeting period against the backdrop of evolving U.S. election and fiscal outlooks, as well as rising COVID-19 cases in the United States and Europe. On net, the Treasury yield curve steepened modestly, corpo- rate bond spreads narrowed somewhat, and broad equity price indexes increased. Inflation compensation in- creased a little further, remaining close to pre-pandemic levels. Financing conditions for businesses with access to capital markets and households with high credit scores remained generally accommodative, although conditions remained tight or tightened somewhat for other borrowers. Yields on two-year nominal Treasury securities were lit- tle changed over the intermeeting period, while longer- term yields increased modestly, on net, reportedly re- flecting market participants’ reassessments of the elec- tion outcome and the outlook for fiscal policy. FOMC communications and macroeconomic data releases did not elicit material yield reactions. Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels. This development reflected in part the recovery of TIPS market liquidity conditions from their stressed levels in the spring. However, both the 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of inflation com- pensation remained near the lower ends of their histori- cal ranges. The expected path for the federal funds rate over the next few years, as implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes, was little changed, on net, since the September FOMC meeting and remained close to the effective lower bound (ELB) until the end of 2023. Sur- vey-based expectations favored the first increase in the federal funds rate to occur in 2024. Broad stock price indexes increased, on balance, over the intermeeting period amid volatility associated with market participants’ reactions to news on the U.S. elec- tion, the pandemic’s trajectory, and the fiscal policy out- look. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—the VIX—increased some, on net, after briefly ris- ing sharply late in the intermeeting period. Spreads on corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treas- ury yields narrowed across the credit spectrum and stood somewhat below their historical median levels at the end of the intermeeting period. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commer- cial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed and remained at pre-pandemic levels. The outstanding level of nonfi- nancial CP continued to move down over the intermeet- ing period, reportedly driven by issuers’ relatively low appetite for CP funding in light of the availability of longer-term financing on attractive terms. September quarter-end effects were muted, and there was no credit outstanding through the Commercial Paper Funding Fa- cility by the end of the intermeeting period. Conditions in money market funds (MMFs) were also generally calm over the intermeeting period, and net yields of MMFs remained stable near historical lows. The effective federal funds rate stood at 9 basis points, unchanged from the average over the previous inter- meeting period. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate averaged 8 basis points, edging down from the previous intermeeting period amid a modest net decrease in Treasury bill issuance. The amount of Federal Reserve repurchase agreements outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period, as dealers were able to ob- tain more attractive rates in the private market. The Fed- eral Reserve increased holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at the same pace as over the previous intermeeting period. Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Investor sentiment abroad turned negative over the in- termeeting period amid rising COVID-19 case counts, newly adopted restrictions aimed at containing the spread of the virus, and indicators pointing to a slowing recovery in several foreign economies, particularly in the euro area. Uncertainty about additional U.S. fiscal stim- ulus and the outcome of the U.S. presidential election also caused some asset price volatility abroad. On net, most foreign equity indexes declined, option-implied volatility in the euro area increased a bit, and most AFE long-term sovereign yields fell. Overall, the broad dollar index was little changed over the intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated mod- estly against most AFE currencies except the Japanese yen and the British pound. Several Asian currencies, in- cluding the Chinese renminbi, the South Korean won, and the Taiwanese dollar, appreciated against the U.S. dollar amid improving growth prospects and low COVID-19 case counts. Most Latin American curren- cies (especially the Brazilian real) and the Turkish lira de- preciated against the U.S. dollar on concerns about fiscal and political prospects in Latin America and Turkey. Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative over the intermeeting period, supported by low interest rates and high equity valua- tions. With historically low corporate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade cor- porate bonds remained solid in September, moderating from robust readings in August but staying close to the averages seen in recent years. Most of this issuance was reportedly intended to refinance existing debt. Gross in- stitutional leveraged loan issuance continued to pick up in September but remained below its average pace in 2019. Collateralized loan obligation issuance was strong in September, likely supporting robust investor demand for newly issued leveraged loans in the coming months. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin- ued to show signs of stabilization. The volume of down- grades to corporate bonds and leveraged loans fell to pre-pandemic levels through September. Corporate bond and leveraged loan defaults were low in August and September relative to their elevated readings in July. Market indicators of expected corporate bond and lev- eraged loan defaults remained somewhat elevated at above pre-pandemic levels, especially for lower-rated leveraged loan issuers. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ bal- ance sheets continued to decline through September, re- flecting a mix of weak origination activity and the repay- ment of credit-line draws from earlier in the year. In the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported that stand- ards for C&I loans continued to tighten during the third quarter, although fewer banks reported tightening than in previous quarters. In addition, demand for C&I loans reportedly weakened in the third quarter. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight as a result of the pandemic. Small business loan origina- tions dropped off sharply in August after a temporary boost from PPP distributions over the summer. At the same time, small businesses’ liquidity needs were high and appeared likely to increase further, with the most re- cent Census Bureau Small Business Pulse Survey point- ing to a majority of small businesses having no more than two months of cash on hand and many small busi- nesses anticipating some need for additional financial as- sistance in the next six months. However, the uncer- tainty surrounding earning prospects was reportedly making many business owners less willing to take on debt at prevailing terms. Small business loan perfor- mance generally deteriorated further over the intermeet- ing period. For commercial real estate (CRE) financed through cap- ital markets, financing conditions remained accommo- dative over the intermeeting period. Spreads on agency CMBS were narrow, and issuance was very strong in September. Spreads on triple-A non-agency CMBS, which were already within their pre-pandemic range in August, moved down further in September and early October, while non-agency issuance remained relatively subdued in September. In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks decelerated in the third quarter, while standards for CRE loans tightened further, according to the Octo- ber SLOOS. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market were little changed over the intermeeting period. Mort- gage rates remained near historical lows, supporting high volumes of both home-purchase and refinancing origi- nations. Credit continued to flow to higher-score bor- rowers meeting standard conforming loan criteria, while it remained tight for borrowers with lower credit scores and for nonstandard mortgage products. Residential real estate loans on banks’ balance sheets declined, and the October SLOOS suggested that lending standards tightened for all mortgage types. Mortgage forbearance rates continued their downward trend, and the rate of new delinquencies remained low. In consumer credit markets, conditions remained ac- commodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 7 scores but continued to be tight for borrowers with sub- prime credit scores. Banks in the October SLOOS indi- cated that standards tightened and demand was little changed, on balance, across consumer loan types follow- ing a sharp contraction in demand in the second quarter. Credit card balances continued to decline through the third quarter, with gains in balances for account holders with prime credit scores offset by declines in those for nonprime accounts. Interest rates on existing accounts were little changed and remained below pre-crisis levels, while interest rates on new accounts to nonprime bor- rowers remained elevated. Auto loan balances increased solidly for prime and near-prime borrowers but declined for subprime borrowers. Auto loan interest rates in- creased but stayed below pre-pandemic levels. Condi- tions in the asset-backed securities market remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff judged that, accounting for low interest rates, asset valuations ap- peared moderate, with measures of compensation for risk generally in the middle of their historical ranges. However, uncertainty regarding the pandemic and eco- nomic outlook has been high, and the risk of sizable de- clines in asset prices, should adverse shocks materialize, has remained significant. CRE prices had started to de- cline in some sectors, while market conditions, including rising vacancies and declining rents, pointed to a risk of further drops, especially in severely affected sectors. The staff assessed vulnerabilities associated with house- hold and business borrowing as notable. Household fi- nances had weakened with the economic downturn, and some households could find debt levels burdensome go- ing forward. Business debt levels were high before the pandemic, and the ability of some businesses to service these obligations will depend on the course of the eco- nomic recovery. The staff assessed vulnerabilities aris- ing from financial leverage as moderate. While the bank- ing sector has been resilient to recent developments, banks’ profitability, as well as that of a range of financial institutions, could be affected by future losses, the weak- ening of the economic outlook relative to pre-pandemic conditions, and low interest rates. With regard to fund- ing risks, the staff highlighted that structural vulnerabili- ties in markets for short-term funding and corporate bonds remained present. Emergency facilities were viewed as critical in restoring market functioning and continued to serve as important backstops. The staff also summarized near-term risks to financial stability identified in outreach to the public in recent months, in- cluding concerns associated with the outlook for the pandemic and business defaults. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the November FOMC meeting, the rate of real GDP growth and the pace of declines in the unemployment rate over the second half of this year were similar to in the September forecast despite material those revisions to several assumptions influencing the outlook along with incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected. In particular, in the absence of clear progress toward an agreement on further fiscal stimulus, the staff removed the assumption that an additional tranche of fiscal policy support would be enacted. Although this lack of additional fiscal support was expected to cause significant hardships for a number of households, the staff now assessed that the savings cushion accumulated by other households would be enough to allow total consumption to be largely maintained through year-end. Hence, as in the September projection, the staff continued to expect a rapid but partial rebound in activity over the second half of the year following the unprecedented contraction in the spring. The inflation forecast for the rest of the year was revised up slightly in response to incoming readings on inflation that were, on balance, higher than expected. Nevertheless, inflation was still projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of slack in labor and product markets and the large declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in the year. In the staff’s medium-term projection, the assumption that significant additional fiscal support would not be enacted pointed to a lower trajectory for aggregate demand going forward. However, recent data on tax receipts also suggested that the fiscal positions of states and localities had deteriorated less than expected, which led the staff to boost the projected path of state and local government purchases. Hence, with monetary policy remain highly accommodative and assumed social-distancing measures expected to ease further, the staff continued to project that real GDP over the medium term would outpace potential, leading to a considerable further decline in the unemployment rate. The resulting take-up of economic slack was in turn expected to cause inflation to increase gradually, and the inflation rate was projected to moderately overshoot 2 percent for some time in the years beyond 2023 as monetary policy remained accommodative. to Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The staff continued to observe that the uncertainty related to the future course of the pandemic and its consequences for the economy was high. The staff also continued to view the risks to the economic outlook as tilted to the downside, with the latest data suggesting an increased probability of a resurgence in the disease. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Eco- nomic activity and employment had continued to re- cover but remained well below their levels at the begin- ning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla- tion. Overall financial conditions remained accommo- dative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economy’s medium-term outlook. Participants observed that the economy had registered a rapid though incomplete rebound, with third-quarter real GDP rising at an annual rate of 33 percent, reflect- ing gains across consumer spending, housing-sector ac- tivity, and business equipment investment. In recent months, however, the pace of improvement had moder- ated, with slower growth expected for the fourth quarter. Participants noted that economic activity thus far had re- covered faster than had been expected earlier in the year. Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, had been strong and had moved above its pre-pandemic level. Participants commented that the rebound in con- sumer spending was due in part to federal stimulus pay- ments and expanded unemployment benefits, which provided essential support to many households. Partic- ipants viewed accommodative monetary policy as also contributing to gains in durable goods and residential in- vestment as well as the surge in home sales. In contrast, participants noted that consumer outlays for services were increasing more slowly than for durable goods, par- ticularly for items such as air travel, hotel accommoda- tions, and restaurant meals, which had been significantly disrupted by voluntary and mandated social-distancing measures. Participants generally expected the strength in household spending to continue, especially for dura- ble goods and residential investment. A few participants noted that households’ balance sheets generally ap- peared healthy and an unwinding of the large pool of household savings accumulated during the pandemic could provide greater-than-anticipated momentum to consumer spending over coming months. However, several participants expressed concern that, in the ab- sence of additional fiscal support, lower- and moderate- income households might need to reduce their spending sharply when their savings were exhausted. A couple of these participants noted reports from their banking con- tacts that households appeared to be rapidly exhausting funds they received from fiscal relief programs. Participants noted that business equipment investment had also picked up. A few participants expected the mo- mentum in investment to extend into next year as the economic recovery continued, while a couple of other participants noted that many businesses in their Districts were deferring longer-term commitments because of heighted uncertainty about the economic outlook. The recovery was viewed as unevenly distributed across in- dustries. While many business contacts, particularly those in the durable goods or housing industries, re- ported progress in adapting to the pandemic or im- proved business conditions, others—especially those with ties to small businesses and the hospitality, aviation, and nonresidential construction industries—were still seeing very difficult circumstances. Contacts reported improved conditions in the agricultural sector, boosted by strong demand from China as well as domestic etha- nol production, higher crop prices, and federal aid pay- ments. Looking ahead, some business contacts ex- pressed concerns that many households and businesses were currently in a weaker position to weather additional economic shocks than they had been at the beginning of the pandemic. Participants observed that labor market conditions had continued to improve in recent months, with roughly half of the 22 million jobs lost over March and April having been regained. The unemployment rate had de- clined further, and the employment gains since the spring were generally seen as larger than anticipated. Business contacts in a couple of Districts—particularly those in the manufacturing, health-care, and technology sectors—reported having trouble hiring workers for rea- sons likely related to virus cases or workers’ need to pro- vide childcare. Several participants noted that the de- cline in the unemployment rate in recent months had been accompanied by a fall in the labor force participa- tion rate, particularly among those with a high school education or lower and among women. Although the number of workers on temporary layoff had fallen _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 9 sharply, the number of permanent job losers had contin- ued to rise. Most participants commented that the pace of labor market improvement was likely to moderate go- ing forward. A couple of them noted that many busi- nesses in industries severely affected by the pandemic were downsizing or that some businesses were focused on cutting costs or increasing productivity, including through automation. Many participants observed that high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent among lower-wage workers, particularly in the services sector, and among women, African Americans, and His- panics. A few participants noted that these trends, if slow to reverse, could exacerbate racial, gender, and other social-economic disparities. In addition, a slow job market recovery would cause particular hardship for those with less educational attainment, less access to childcare or broadband, or greater need for retraining. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that some consumer prices had increased more quickly than expected in recent months but that broader price trends were still quite soft. The upturn in consumer price inflation was primarily attributed to price increases in sectors where the pandemic had induced stronger de- mand, such as consumer durables. In contrast, services price inflation remained softer than pre-pandemic rates, as prices for the categories most affected by social dis- tancing, such as accommodations and airfares, contin- ued to be very depressed and housing services inflation moderated. Several participants commented on the un- usually large relative price movements caused by the pandemic and the considerable uncertainty as to how long these price changes would persist. Participants noted that financial conditions were gener- ally accommodative and that actions by the Federal Re- serve, including the establishment of emergency lending facilities with the approval of and, in some cases, provi- sion of equity investments by the Treasury, were sup- porting the flow of credit to households, businesses, and communities. While these actions were viewed as con- tributing to accommodative financial conditions, partic- ipants noted important differences in credit availability across borrowers. In particular, financing conditions eased further for residential mortgage borrowers and for large corporations that were able to access capital mar- kets, but surveys of credit availability indicated that bank lending conditions tightened further. A few participants noted that the financing conditions for small businesses were especially worrisome, as the PPP had ended and the prospect for additional fiscal support remained un- certain. They pointed to the most recent Census Bureau Small Business Pulse Survey, in which more than half of the respondents reported having no more than two months of cash on hand. Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround- ing the economic outlook as quite elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the virus; on how individuals, businesses, and public officials responded to it; and on the effectiveness of public health measures to address it. Participants cited several down- side risks that could threaten the recovery. While an- other broad economic shutdown was seen as unlikely, participants remained concerned about the possibility of a further resurgence of the virus that could undermine the recovery. The majority of participants also saw the risk that current and expected fiscal support for house- holds, businesses, and state and local governments might not be sufficient to sustain activity levels in those sectors, while a few participants noted that additional fiscal stim- ulus that was larger than anticipated could be an upside risk. Some participants commented that the recent surge in virus cases in Europe and the reimposition of re- strictions there could lead to a slowdown in economic activity in the euro area and have negative spillover ef- fects on the U.S. recovery. Some participants raised con- cerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including sectoral restructurings that could slow employ- ment growth or an acceleration of technological disrup- tions that could be limiting the pricing power of some firms. A number of participants commented on various poten- tial risks to financial stability. A few participants noted that the banking system showed considerable resilience through the end of the third quarter, and a few observed that this resilience partly reflected stronger-than-ex- pected balance sheets of their customers, with delin- quency rates declining or showing only moderate in- creases. Moreover, capital positions and loan loss re- serves for large banks were higher than before the pan- demic. Several participants emphasized the need to en- sure that banks continue to maintain strong capital lev- els, as lower levels of capital are typically associated with tighter credit availability from banks. Several partici- pants commented on the vulnerabilities witnessed dur- ing the March selloff in the Treasury market. The sub- stantial maturity and liquidity transformations under- taken by some nonbank financial institutions—such as prime MMFs and corporate bond and bank loan mutual funds—were also discussed. A couple of participants expressed concerns that a prolonged period of low in- terest rates and highly accommodative financial market conditions could lead to excessive risk-taking, which in Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ turn could result in elevated firm bankruptcies and sig- nificant employment losses in the next economic down- turn. A few participants noted that climate change poses important challenges to financial stability and welcomed analysis of climate change as both a source of shocks and an underlying vulnerability. A couple of participants commented that the actions taken by the Federal Re- serve to support the economy and achieve its mandated goals also supported financial stability. Relatedly, several participants emphasized the important roles various sec- tion 13(3) facilities played in restoring financial market confidence and supporting financial stability; they noted that these facilities were still serving as an important backstop in financial markets. A few participants noted that it was important to extend them beyond year-end. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools in order to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promoting the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic ac- tivity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. In light of this assessment, all partic- ipants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic re- covery and to achieve the Committee’s long-run 2 per- cent inflation objective. Participants remarked that the Committee’s action in September to provide more explicit outcome-based for- ward guidance for the federal funds rate had been an im- portant step to affirm the Committee’s strong commit- ment to the goals and strategy articulated in its revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. Several participants noted that they were en- couraged by evidence that suggested that market partic- ipants’ expectations of the economic conditions that would likely prevail at the time of liftoff seemed broadly consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance and revised consensus statement. Participants agreed that monetary policy was providing substantial accommodation, and most concurred that, with the federal funds rate at the ELB, much of that ac- commodation was due to the Committee’s forward guid- ance and increases in securities holdings. They judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained ap- propriate, as both employment and inflation remained well short of the Committee’s goals and the uncertainty about the course of the virus and the outlook for the economy continued to be very elevated. Participants viewed the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the United States and abroad as a downside risk to the recovery; a few participants noted that diminished odds for further significant fiscal support also increased downside risks and added to uncertainty about the economic outlook. Regarding asset purchases, participants judged that it would be appropriate over coming months for the Fed- eral Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency MBS at least at the current pace. These actions would continue to help sustain smooth market functioning and help foster accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Many participants judged that the Committee might want to enhance its guidance for asset purchases fairly soon. Most participants fa- vored moving to qualitative outcome-based guidance for asset purchases that links the horizon over which the Committee anticipates it would be conducting asset pur- chases to economic conditions. A few participants were hesitant to make changes in the near term to the guid- ance for asset purchases and pointed to considerable un- certainty about the economic outlook and the appropri- ate use of balance sheet policies given that uncertainty. Discussion on Recommended Changes to the Sum- mary of Economic Projections Participants considered two recommendations from the subcommittee on communications for changes to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) that would enhance the information provided to the public. These recommendations included accelerating the release of the full set of SEP exhibits from three weeks after the corresponding FOMC meeting, when the minutes of that meeting are released, to the day of the policy deci- sion and adding new charts that display a time series of diffusion indexes for participants’ judgments of uncer- tainty and risks. With these recommendations, the writ- ten summary of the projections that has been included as an addendum to the minutes of the corresponding FOMC meeting would be discontinued. Most of the participants who commented noted that re- leasing all SEP materials at the time of the postmeeting statement would provide greater context for the policy decision, highlight the risk-management factors relevant for the decision, or further emphasize the degree of un- certainty around participants’ modal projections. Some who commented noted that the SEP serves a valuable role in illustrating how participants’ policy assessments _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 4–5, 2020Page 11 respond to changes in the economic outlook. Most par- ticipants who commented suggested that it would be useful to continue thinking about options for refining the SEP. Participants unanimously supported the rec- ommended changes and agreed that they should be im- plemented beginning in December. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had con- tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con- sumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions re- in part reflecting policy mained accommodative, measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this chal- lenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employ- ment and price-stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range un- til labor market conditions had reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employ- ment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that over coming months it would be appropriate for the Federal Reserve to increase its holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS at least at the current pace to sustain smooth market func- tioning and help foster accommodative financial condi- tions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to house- holds and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective November 6, 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:   Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 0 to ¼ percent. Increase the System Open Market Ac- count holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the current pace. Increase holdings of Treasury securities and agency MBS by ad- ditional amounts and purchase agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) as needed to sustain smooth func- tioning of markets for these securities.  Conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations to support effective policy implementation and the smooth functioning of short-term U.S. dollar funding markets.  Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 0.00 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair.  Roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and reinvest all princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for purchases and reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate set- tlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “The Federal Reserve is committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employment and price stability goals. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to re- cover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and ear- lier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation.

Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Patrick Harker, Robert S. Kaplan, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Ms. Daly voted as alternate member at this meeting. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.10 percent. The Board of Governors also voted unan- imously to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 0.25 percent, effective No- vember 6, 2020. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, December 15– 16, 2020. The meeting adjourned at 10:05 a.m. on No- vember 5, 2020.

Market sentiment improved over the pe- riod, as reduced uncertainty related to the U.S. election and positive vaccine news outweighed the anticipated ef- fect of the ongoing surge in the pandemic. U.S. equity price indexes reached all-time highs, with the largest gains registered in sectors that have underperformed during the pandemic. Corporate credit spreads tight- ened, most notably among lower-rated firms and in sec- tors most affected by social distancing measures result- ing from the pandemic. Longer-term Treasury yields rose modestly, driven by increases in inflation compen- sation. The positive vaccine news also supported risk sentiment abroad, leading many global equity price in- dexes to advance and the U.S. dollar to depreciate fur- ther. Market participants had highlighted that uncertainty nevertheless remained high and had pointed to several prominent risks to the economic outlook. These risks included the possibility that the vaccine rollout might not proceed as smoothly as anticipated, the potential for adverse developments in negotiations concerning the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Un- ion, and the potential for deterioration in already strained sectors, such as those involving small businesses and certain segments of commercial real estate (CRE). With regard to market expectations concerning the pol- icy outlook, responses to the Open Market Desk surveys of dealers and market participants suggested that views on the most likely timing of the next increase in the tar- get range for the federal funds rate coalesced further around the first half of 2024. Survey responses contin- ued to indicate median expectations of headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation above 2 per- cent and an unemployment rate of around 4 percent at Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the time of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. A majority of Desk survey respond- ents indicated that they expected the Committee to re- vise its guidance on asset purchases at the current meet- ing, with many noting that they anticipated the an- nouncement of some form of qualitative, outcome- based guidance tied to inflation, the unemployment rate, or both. Median Desk survey responses continued to suggest expectations that purchases would begin to slow in the first half of 2022 and cease altogether in 2023. The size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased to around $7.3 trillion over the intermeeting period, driven by growth in securities holdings. The Desk con- ducted purchases to increase holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at the minimum pace directed by the FOMC, as markets for these securities continued to function smoothly. News that CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) funding would not be available to support new activity in section 13(3) facilities after the end of the year had only a modest effect on financial markets. New activity remained limited across most Federal Reserve funding operations and section 13(3) fa- cilities, although the Municipal Liquidity Facility and the Main Street Lending Program saw growing usage over the period, with more take-up expected before their scheduled year-end termination. The manager discussed a proposal to extend the tempo- rary U.S. dollar liquidity swap arrangements as well as the temporary FIMA (Foreign and International Mone- tary Authorities) Repo Facility through September 2021. The path to a complete economic recovery remained un- certain across the globe, particularly for many emerging market countries, underscoring the need for backstops that could address potential market stresses and prevent spillovers from reemerging. Keeping these arrange- ments in place would contribute to sustaining improve- ments in global dollar funding markets and to the con- tinued smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury securi- ties market. Under the proposal, provided that the Com- mittee had no objections, the Chair would approve the extension of the temporary liquidity swap lines following the meeting. The extensions of the swap and FIMA re- purchase agreement (repo) arrangements would be an- nounced following this meeting. Market participants generally anticipated calm money market conditions through year-end, and the premiums paid for dollar funding crossing year-end generally were below those observed in recent years. Money market fu- tures also indicated expectations of short-term rates moving down modestly in coming months, in light of anticipated further increases in aggregate reserve bal- ances and a moderation in Treasury bill supply. The manager anticipated that administered rates and the overnight reverse repo program would be effective tools for maintaining control of overnight money market rates. By unanimous vote, the Committee voted to approve a resolution that extended through September 30, 2021, the expiration of a temporary repo facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Fa- cility).5 Secretary’s note: The Chair subsequently pro- vided approval to the Desk, following the pro- cedures in the Authorization for Foreign Cur- rency Operations, to extend the expiration of the temporary U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines through September 30, 2021. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain its spread continued to affect economic activ- ity in the United States and abroad. The information available at the time of the December 15–16 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was continuing to recover in the fourth quarter, but at a more moderate pace than its rapid third-quarter rate, and that the level of real GDP remained well below its level at the start of 2020. Labor market conditions improved further over October and November, although employ- ment continued to be well below its level at the begin- ning of the year. Consumer price inflation through Oc- tober—as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the PCE price index—remained notably below the rates seen in early 2020. Total nonfarm payroll employment continued to in- crease solidly over October and November, though the rate of monthly job gains was more moderate than the substantial third-quarter pace. Through November, 5 The approved FIMA Desk Resolution, which updates the July 2020 resolution with a new expiration date, is available along with other Committee organizational documents at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/rules_au- thorizations.htm. Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ payroll employment had regained somewhat more than half of the losses seen at the onset of the pandemic. The unemployment rate moved down further and stood at 6.7 percent in November. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispanics each declined but re- mained well above the national average. Both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio in November were above their levels of two months earlier. The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance was only slightly lower in early December than it had been in late October. Weekly estimates of private-sector payrolls constructed by Federal Reserve Board staff using data provided by the payroll processor ADP suggested that the four-week average of private employment gains in early December was lower than it was in mid-November. Both the 12-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees through November and the four- quarter change in total labor compensation per hour in the business sector through the third quarter continued to be dominated by changes in the composition of the workforce. The substantial employment losses over the past year were most significant among lower-wage work- ers—a situation that had led to outsized increases in these average measures of earnings and compensation that were not indicative of tight labor market conditions. Total PCE price inflation was 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in October, and it continued to be held down by relatively weak aggregate demand and the declines in consumer energy prices seen earlier in 2020. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 1.4 percent over the same period, while the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 1.7 percent in October. In November, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 1.2 percent, while core CPI inflation was 1.6 percent over the same period. The latest readings on survey- based measures of longer-run inflation expectations edged up, though each remained within the range in which it has fluctuated in recent years; in November and early December, the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure for the next 5 to 10 years was slightly above its level in October, while the 3-year-ahead measure produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York rose a bit in November. Real PCE rose strongly in October, though at a more moderate pace than in the third quarter. Real disposable personal income declined in October, reflecting a large in government transfer payments, even reduction though wage and salary income continued to climb. As a result, the personal saving rate moved lower, though it continued to be notably above its 2019 average. In No- vember, the components of the nominal retail sales data used to estimate PCE, along with the rate of light motor vehicle sales, stepped down, possibly reflecting the ef- fects on consumer spending of renewed social- distancing measures and concerns about the resurgent pandemic. Consumer sentiment, as measured by both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board, moved somewhat lower, on net, since October, although both indexes were still above their April troughs. Housing-sector activity advanced further, on balance, in October, supported in part by low interest rates. Starts and construction permits for single-family homes con- tinued to rise, while starts of multi-family units moved sideways. Sales of existing homes increased solidly, though new home sales were roughly flat. Business fixed investment appeared to be expanding fur- ther, on net, in the fourth quarter following an outsized third-quarter increase. Nominal shipments of nonde- fense capital goods excluding aircraft rose strongly in October, and new orders for these capital goods contin- ued to advance. By contrast, nominal spending on non- residential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined further in October. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending on structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to move up somewhat through early December, although the number of rigs in operation was still subdued, reflecting the effect of low oil prices on drilling investment. Industrial production rose strongly over October and November, led by gains in manufacturing output, but production was still below its February pre-pandemic level. The pickup in the production of motor vehicles and related parts was particularly strong in November. Output in the mining sector—which includes crude oil and natural gas drilling and extraction—increased, on net, over October and November. Total real government purchases appeared to be declin- ing moderately, on balance, in the fourth quarter. Fed- eral defense spending continued to rise in October and November, although federal employment declined with the layoff of temporary census workers. State and local government payrolls decreased in October and Novem- ber, and nominal state and local construction expendi- tures in October were somewhat below their third-quar- ter level. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in October. Both imports and exports continued to re- bound from their collapse in the first half of the year. Goods imports in October rose above their January level after several months of strong growth. Goods exports, however, had only recovered three-fourths of their de- cline since January despite brisk growth in agricultural exports. Services trade remained depressed, driven by the continued suspension of most international travel. After a strong rebound in the third quarter, foreign eco- nomic growth appeared to slow sharply in recent months. The resurgence of coronavirus infections in Europe and Canada prompted governments to reintro- duce social-distancing restrictions, leading to a fall in measures of mobility and services activity. Even so, with restrictions less severe and more targeted than in the spring, the hit to economic activity looked to be more limited. Economic growth appeared to hold up better in several emerging Asian economies. In these econo- mies, effective virus control was supporting domestic demand, while strong external demand boosted exports. Inflationary pressures remained subdued in most foreign economies amid substantial economic slack. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial market sentiment improved over the inter- meeting period, boosted by news of forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines and reduced uncertainty following the U.S. election that outweighed concerns regarding the continued rise in COVID-19 cases and the potential ef- fects of ensuing restrictions. Corporate bond spreads narrowed, and major global equity price indexes rose on net. The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve, in- creased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depre- ciation. Financing conditions for businesses able to ac- cess capital markets and households possessing high credit scores remained accommodative and eased a bit further in some sectors, but conditions for borrowers dependent on bank financing remained tight. Yields on 2-year nominal Treasury securities were little changed since the November FOMC meeting, while 10- and 30-year yields rose moderately. Market partici- pants attributed the increases in longer-term yields pri- marily to greater optimism about the economic outlook, due to the forthcoming availability of effective vaccines and renewed fiscal stimulus negotiations. Near-dated option-implied volatility on the 10-year Treasury futures contract declined to historic lows. The rise in longer- term Treasury yields was concentrated in inflation com- pensation. The 5-year and 5-to-10-year measures of in- flation compensation based on Treasury Inflation Pro- tected Securities rose above their pre-pandemic levels. The expected path of the federal funds rate, based on a straight read of overnight index swap rates, remained close to the effective lower bound through mid-2023. Survey-based measures indicated that market expecta- tions regarding the federal funds rate target range did not show a tightening until 2024. Broad stock price indexes increased over the intermeet- ing period, led by steep stock price gains in cyclical sec- tors and buoyed by the prospect of successful vaccines and lower post-election uncertainty. One-month S&P 500 option-implied volatility—the VIX—declined, re- versing a pre-election increase. Consistent with the op- timism driving stock prices, spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields nar- rowed markedly across the credit spectrum, most nota- bly for debt securities of the lowest credit quality firms. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period. Spreads on commer- cial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit across different tenors were little changed, on net, and remained around pre-pandemic levels despite continued outflows from prime money market funds (MMFs) and the coming year-end. CP issuance was robust over the intermeeting period across the different tenors. With the yields of prime MMFs approaching those of government MMFs, assets under management (AUM) of prime MMFs declined moderately, while AUM of government MMFs were little changed. Net yields of prime and gov- ernment MMFs both remained near historically low lev- els. The intermeeting averages of the effective federal funds rate and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate remained unchanged from the previous intermeeting period aver- ages, at 9 basis points and 8 basis points, respectively. Term and forward repo market quotes indicated muted year-end funding pressure amid ample liquidity condi- tions. The Federal Reserve maintained its pace of pur- chases of Treasury securities and agency MBS, and Fed- eral Reserve repos outstanding remained at zero over the intermeeting period. Investor sentiment abroad improved over the intermeet- ing period, as favorable news on COVID-19 vaccines and the resolution of uncertainty regarding the U.S. elec- tion apparently outweighed concerns about another surge in COVID-19 cases and the resulting adoption of tighter social-distancing restrictions in many countries. Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ On balance, prices of global risky assets increased nota- bly, implied volatility dropped sharply, and the dollar de- preciated against most currencies. Most advanced for- eign economy sovereign yields were little changed, on net, as policymakers in several countries announced ad- ditional actions aimed at maintaining accommodative fi- nancial conditions. Financing conditions in capital markets continued to be broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations. With historically low corpo- rate bond yields, gross issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade bonds remained solid in October. Much of the recent issuance was intended to refinance existing debt. Gross institutional leveraged loan issu- ance increased substantially in October for both new loans and refinancing. Seasoned equity offerings in Oc- tober and November were similar to the typical volumes observed in previous years, though equity raised through initial public offerings moderated somewhat from the robust rate of issuance in September. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans outstanding on banks’ balance sheets contracted in October and November, reflecting the continued paydown of loan balances and the start of Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness activity. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations contin- ued to show signs of stabilization. Although the volume of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades outpaced upgrades somewhat in October and November, nonfi- nancial corporate bond defaults continued to decline. The rate of leveraged loan defaults was largely un- changed in October, albeit at somewhat elevated levels. Market indicators of future default expectations for cor- porate bonds fell slightly but remained above their pre- pandemic levels. In the municipal bond market, financ- ing conditions remained accommodative. Issuance of state and local government debt moderated in Novem- ber after all-time high issuance in October, and market- based measures of state credit quality were little changed on net. Financing conditions for small businesses remained tight, although some indicators suggested that they might have improved a bit. Data provided by the Fed- eral Reserve Small Business Lending Survey showed that standards for small businesses tightened, on net, over the third quarter, consistent with the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac- tices. Small business loan originations ticked up in Oc- tober to a level near that seen in the same period last year. Short-term delinquencies and defaults remained relatively elevated but significantly lower than the levels observed following the financial crisis. In light of the uncertain outlook, small business owners’ assessments of the risk of permanent closures remained elevated in most sectors, according to the Census Small Business Pulse Survey. In the CRE market, financing conditions remained ac- commodative, on net, over the intermeeting period. Agency commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) spreads remained narrow amid strong issuance in Octo- ber, while non-agency CMBS spreads ticked down. Triple-B-rated non-agency CMBS spreads came down substantially from their highs in the spring, although they remained elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Non-agency issuance picked up in October, nearing pre- pandemic levels. CRE bank loan growth in October and November remained weak, consistent with tightened bank lending standards. In the residential mortgage market, financing conditions remained highly accommodative for borrowers access- ing government-backed loans. Mortgage rates remained near historic lows, supporting robust loan originations. Credit continued to flow to higher-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria while remaining tight for lower-score borrowers and for nonstandard mortgage products. The credit quality of mortgages was little changed, as the fraction of mortgages in forbear- ance held fairly steady, and the rate of transition into mortgage delinquency remained at pre-pandemic levels. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets re- mained generally accommodative for borrowers with relatively strong credit. Credit card balances and average credit limits on existing accounts contracted, on net, for all types of borrowers. However, auto loan balances continued to increase for higher-quality borrowers, and loan rates remained well below pre-pandemic levels. Conditions in the asset-backed securities market re- mained stable over the intermeeting period. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the December FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised up and the unemployment rate revised down for the fourth quarter relative to the November meeting forecast. These revisions reflected incoming data that were, on balance, better than expected, although the re- cent resurgence of the pandemic and increased social- distancing restrictions in many states and localities were expected to weigh on economic activity in the coming months. As a result, the staff expected that real GDP growth would temporarily weaken in the first quarter of 2021, and the slowing seen in some of the most recent Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ high-frequency indicators of spending and employment appeared consistent with that forecast. The inflation forecast for the rest of 2020 was revised down slightly in response to incoming data, and inflation was projected to finish the year at a relatively subdued level, reflecting substantial margins of labor- and product-market slack in the economy and the large declines in consumer en- ergy prices seen earlier in 2020. Primarily in response to the recent favorable news on the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the staff re- vised up its projection of real GDP growth for 2021 as a whole, as social-distancing measures were expected to ease more quickly than previously assumed. With mon- etary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to project that real GDP growth over the medium term would be well above the rate of poten- tial output growth, leading to a considerable further de- cline in the unemployment rate. The resulting take-up of labor- and product-market slack was expected to lead to gradually increasing inflation, and, for some time in the years beyond 2023, inflation was projected to over- shoot 2 percent by a moderate amount, as monetary pol- icy remained accommodative. The staff observed that the uncertainty related to the fu- ture course of the pandemic, the measures to control it, and the associated economic effects remained elevated. In addition, the staff continued to judge the risks to the economic outlook as being tilted to the downside. The recent sharp resurgence in the pandemic suggested that the near-term risks had risen, while the recent favorable developments regarding vaccines pointed to some re- duction in the downside risks over the medium term. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2020 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of ap- propriate monetary policy, including the path of the fed- eral funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, un- der appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Eco- nomic Projections (SEP) was released to the public fol- lowing the conclusion of the meeting. Participants noted that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Eco- nomic activity and employment had continued to re- cover but remained well below their levels at the begin- ning of the year. Weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price infla- tion. Overall financial conditions remained accommo- dative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and posed considerable risks to the eco- nomic outlook over the medium term. Participants observed that the economy continued to show resilience in the face of the pandemic, though it was still far from having attained conditions consistent with the Committee’s dual mandate. They noted that the economic recovery thus far had been stronger than anticipated—suggesting greater momentum in eco- nomic activity than had been previously thought—but viewed the more recent indicators as signaling that the pace of recovery had slowed. With the pandemic wors- ening across the country, the expansion was expected to slow even further in coming months. Nevertheless, the positive vaccine news received over the intermeeting pe- riod was viewed as favorable for the medium-term eco- nomic outlook. Participants noted that household spending on goods, especially durables, had been strong. Participants com- mented that the rebound in consumer spending was due, in part, to fiscal programs such as federal stimulus pay- ments and expanded unemployment benefits. These measures had provided essential support to many house- holds. The support to incomes provided by fiscal pro- grams, combined with reduced spending by households on some services, had contributed to a historically large increase in aggregate household savings. Participants also observed that residential investment and home sales remained robust. Accommodative monetary policy was viewed as having provided support to interest rate sen- sitive expenditure categories, including residential in- vestment and consumer durables spending. Participants regarded the positive news on vaccine development as further strengthening the medium-term outlook for household spending. However, participants saw in- creased challenges for the economy in the coming months, as the ongoing surge of COVID-19 cases and the related mandatory and voluntary measures prompted greater social distancing and damped spending, espe- cially on services requiring in-person contact. Several Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ participants pointed out that readings on high-frequency economic indicators, such as individual mobility indexes and online restaurant reservation data, might already be registering the effects of the recent rise in virus cases. Various participants noted that low-income households were particularly hard hit by the effects of the resurgent virus, and that—with the looming expiration of the ex- panded unemployment benefits, eviction moratoria, and loan forbearance programs—their situations could dete- riorate significantly if additional relief and support did not materialize. With respect to the business sector, participants ob- served that business equipment investment had picked up further, with strong readings registered on new or- ders and shipments. A couple of participants remarked that the very low levels of inventories would likely be a factor supporting increases in production as demand continued to recover. Participants noted that the eco- nomic recovery had been uneven across firms and in- dustries. Though many business contacts, particularly those in the durable goods or housing sectors, reported progress in adapting to the pandemic and improved business practices, others—especially those closely linked to the leisure, travel, and hospitality industries— were still struggling, and their problems were intensify- ing because of the resurgence of the virus. Furthermore, while larger firms were generally seen as recovering rea- sonably well, conditions remained worrisome for small businesses. A number of participants noted that many small businesses were in especially vulnerable positions and that further fiscal policy support would help such businesses weather the ongoing surge in the pandemic, especially over the coming months. Looking further ahead, participants observed that continuing positive de- velopments on the vaccine front could further support business investment by helping reduce stresses in pandemic-sensitive industries and by boosting confi- dence. Participants remarked that labor market conditions gen- erally had continued to improve, but they were still a long way from those consistent with the Committee’s maximum employment goal. Although the pace of em- ployment gains had moderated in recent months, the overall recovery in employment thus far had been faster than anticipated, with a little more than half of the 22 million jobs lost over March and April having been regained. The unemployment rate had declined further, although several participants underlined the fact that the labor force participation rate remained below its pre- pandemic level—likely reflecting, in part, health con- cerns and additional childcare responsibilities associated with online schooling. Participants assessed that the on- going surge in COVID-19 infections would be particu- larly challenging for the labor market in coming months, but they indicated that they expected employment to continue to recover over the medium term. Participants stressed that the burdens of the economic downturn had fallen unequally on different groups; in particular, high rates of job losses had been especially prevalent among lower-wage workers and among African Americans and Hispanics. Some participants expressed the concern that the longer the pandemic continued, the more lasting damage to the labor market there could be. They noted that the number of unemployed workers who had been permanently laid off had increased notably in recent months and that those workers historically often re- quired a longer time to find a new job than those tem- porarily laid off. In light of these considerations, several participants assessed that improvements in the labor market were lagging that of economic activity, and they indicated that they had not revised their projections of labor market variables to the same extent as their revi- sion of the outlook for economic activity. In their comments about inflation, participants noted that increases in consumer prices had been soft of late, as prices of products in those categories most affected by social distancing—such as hotel accommodations and air travel—continued to be depressed and increases in rents remained low. These patterns were expected to continue in the near term as pandemic concerns intensi- fied over the winter. However, participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year, with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing social-distancing concerns and spurring eco- nomic activity. A couple of participants suggested that, as a result of ongoing technology-enabled disruption to business models and practices or lasting pandemic- induced restraint on firms’ pricing power, downward pressure on inflation could persist. Several participants noted a pickup in market-based measures of inflation compensation. Participants expected that, with contin- ued monetary policy support, inflation would rise over time. In their SEP submissions, seven participants— five more than in the September SEP—expected overall inflation to be above the Committee’s 2 percent longer- run objective in 2023. Participants noted that overall financial conditions were accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to house- holds and businesses. However, participants underlined important differences in credit availability across bor- rowers. Financing conditions eased further for large Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ corporations that were able to access capital markets, as equity prices rose and corporate credit spreads contin- ued to narrow, but smaller firms and some households reliant on bank lending continued to face tight lending standards. Participants noted that the financing condi- tions for small businesses were especially strained, with a few participants pointing out that a sizable fraction of small businesses had permanently closed or were in the process of transitioning to closure. A couple of partici- pants observed that aggregate banking data had not in- dicated a significant increase in loan delinquencies for C&I loans thus far, though this development could be partly due to the CARES Act provisions that provided relief to many troubled borrowers or to the fact that many small businesses had gone out of business without declaring bankruptcy or defaulting on loans. Some par- ticipants noted the important role played by the various section 13(3) facilities implemented in 2020 in serving as temporary backstops to key credit markets and in help- ing to restore and maintain the flow of credit to house- holds, businesses, and communities. These participants also mentioned the announcement that CARES Act funding to support new activity in many of these facili- ties would not be available after December 31, and a number noted that they saw downside risks associated with this development. Participants continued to see the uncertainty surround- ing the economic outlook as elevated, with the path of the economy highly dependent on the course of the vi- rus. The positive vaccine news was seen as reducing downside risks over the medium term, and a number of participants saw risks to economic activity as more bal- anced than earlier. Still, participants saw significant un- certainties regarding how quickly the deployment of vac- cines would proceed as well as how different members of the public would respond to the availability of vac- cines. Participants cited several downside risks that could threaten the economic recovery. These risks in- cluded the possibility of significant additional fiscal pol- icy support not materializing in a timely manner, the po- tential for further adverse pandemic developments— which could lead to more-stringent restrictions, more- severe business failures, and more permanent job losses—and the chance that trade negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union would not be concluded successfully before the December 31 deadline. As upside risks, participants mentioned the prospect that the release of pent-up demand, spurred by wider-scale vaccinations and easing of social distancing, could boost spending and bring individuals back to the labor force more quickly than currently expected as well as the possibility that fiscal policy developments could see measures that were larger than expected in amount or economic impact. Regarding inflation, participants generally viewed the risks as having become more bal- anced than they were earlier in the year, though most still viewed the risks as being weighted to the downside. As an upside risk to inflation, a few participants noted the potential for a stronger-than-expected recovery, coupled with the possible emergence of pandemic-related supply constraints, to boost inflation. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve’s commit- ment to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy during this challenging time, thereby promot- ing the Committee’s statutory goals of maximum em- ployment and price stability. Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, em- ployment, and inflation in the near term. Participants noted that, with the pandemic worsening across the country, the expansion would likely slow in coming months. In contrast, for the medium term, participants commented that positive vaccine news had improved the economic outlook. That said, participants agreed that the path ahead remained highly uncertain and that the economy remained far from the Committee’s longer- run goals. In light of this assessment, all participants judged that maintaining an accommodative stance of monetary policy was essential to foster economic recov- ery and to achieve an average inflation rate of 2 percent over time. All participants supported enhancing the Committee’s guidance on asset purchases at this meeting and, in par- ticular, adopting qualitative, outcome-based guidance in- dicating that increases in asset holdings would continue, with purchases of Treasury securities of at least $80 bil- lion per month and of agency MBS of at least $40 billion per month, until substantial further progress has been made toward reaching the Committee’s maximum em- ployment and price stability goals. In their discussions of this change, participants noted that the new guidance regarding balance sheet policy brought the statement’s references to purchases into better alignment with the Committee’s outcome-based guidance on the federal funds rate, offered more clarity about the role played by the asset purchase program in providing accommoda- tion to meet the Committee’s economic goals, and un- derscored the responsiveness of balance sheet policy to unanticipated economic developments. A few partici- pants stressed that all of the Committee’s policy tools Minutes of the Meeting of December 15–16, 2020Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ were now well positioned to respond to the evolution of the economy. For example, if progress toward the Com- mittee’s goals proved slower than anticipated, the new guidance relayed the Committee’s intention to respond by increasing monetary policy accommodation through maintaining the current level of the target range of the federal funds rate for longer and raising the expected path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. A couple of participants remarked that, against this background, it was important to convey to the public that the federal funds rate remained the Committee’s primary policy tool. A number of participants discussed considerations re- lated to determining the eventual attainment of “sub- stantial further progress” toward reaching the Commit- tee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. Participants commented that this judgment would be broad, qualitative, and not based on specific numerical criteria or thresholds. Various participants noted the im- portance of the Committee clearly communicating its as- sessment of actual and expected progress toward its longer-run goals well in advance of the time when it could be judged substantial enough to warrant a change in the pace of purchases. Regarding the decisions on the pace and composition of the Committee’s asset purchases, all participants judged that it would be appropriate to continue those purchases at least at the current pace, and nearly all favored main- taining the current composition of purchases, although a couple of participants indicated that they were open to weighting purchases of Treasury securities toward longer maturities. Participants generally judged that the asset purchase program as structured was providing very significant policy accommodation. Some participants noted that the Committee could consider future adjust- ments to its asset purchases—such as increasing the pace of securities purchases or weighting purchases of Treas- ury securities toward those that had longer remaining maturities—if such adjustments were deemed appropri- ate to support the attainment of the Committee’s objec- tives. A few participants underlined the importance of continuing to evaluate the balance of costs and risks as- sociated with asset purchases against the benefits arising from purchases. Participants shared their views on the appropriate evo- lution of asset purchases once substantial further pro- gress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals. A number of par- ticipants noted that, once such progress had been at- tained, a gradual tapering of purchases could begin and the process thereafter could generally follow a sequence similar to the one implemented during the large-scale purchase program in 2013 and 2014. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the COVID-19 pandemic was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. They noted that economic activity and employment had con- tinued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down con- sumer price inflation. Overall financial conditions re- mained accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U.S. economy in this chal- lenging time, thereby promoting its maximum employ- ment and price stability goals. Members also stated that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus. In addition, members agreed that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term and was posing considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. All members reaffirmed that, in accordance with the Committee’s goals to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run and with inflation running persistently below this longer- run goal, they would aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expecta- tions remain well anchored at 2 percent. Members ex- pected to maintain an accommodative stance of mone- tary policy until those outcomes were achieved. All members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent, and they expected that it would be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions had reached levels con- sistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment and inflation had risen to 2 percent and was on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, members agreed that it would be appropri- ate for the Federal Reserve to continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and agency MBS by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress had been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price sta- bility goals. They judged that these asset purchases Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ would help foster smooth market functioning and ac- commodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Members also agreed that, in as- sessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on public health, labor market condi- tions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Economic activity and employment have continued to re- cover but remain well below their levels at the beginning of the year. Weaker demand and ear- lier declines in oil prices have been holding down consumer price inflation. Overall finan- cial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the econ- omy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The path of the economy will depend signifi- cantly on the course of the virus. The ongoing public health crisis will continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running per- sistently below this longer-run goal, the Com- mittee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation 6 The statement approved at the meeting included a drafting error.
