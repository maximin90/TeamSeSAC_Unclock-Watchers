The new unified document improves clarity and transparency in the governance of Desk activities but does not make substantive changes to governance. The domestic policy directive released after each FOMC meeting will have modest conforming changes going forward. Ahead of the vote on policies relating to information se- curity, external communications, and investment and trading, the Chair commented on the critical importance of maintaining the public’s trust and confidence in the Federal Reserve as an institution and indicated that these policies were very important in that regard. All partici- pants indicated support for, and agreed to abide by the requirements of, the Program for Security of FOMC In- formation (Program), the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff, and the Investment and Trading Policy for FOMC Officials. The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm all four policies without revision.3 As part of the Committee’s annual organizational review process, all participants indicated support for the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, and the Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm it without revision.3 Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager pro tem turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments. Market participants generally expected U.S. economic growth to moderate this year, although there was a wide dispersion in views about the extent of a potential slowdown. Market par- ticipants interpreted incoming data as pointing to mod- erating inflation risks. Against this backdrop, market participants judged that the FOMC would likely slow the pace of rate increases further at the current meeting, and respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants widely expected the Committee to implement a ¼ percentage point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. Survey re- spondents assessed that uncertainty around the likely peak level of the policy rate narrowed relative to the comparable results from the December surveys and, on average, placed significant probability on a target federal funds rate range close to 5 percent. A significant share of survey respondents anticipated that the Committee would hold the policy rate stable for much of 2023. Moderating inflation in the United States and improving global growth prospects lifted market sentiment. While most Desk survey respondents expected subdued growth or a mild recession in 2023, market participants continued to see notable uncertainties ahead, including prospects for a deeper downturn or the potential for more persistent inflation. Regarding the international outlook, signs of a faster re- opening in China and a less severe downturn in Europe eased concerns about global growth, contributing to a depreciation in the exchange value of the dollar and sup- porting optimism about emerging market economies. Narrowing interest rate differentials between the United States and other advanced foreign economies also con- tributed to dollar depreciation, as some foreign central bank communications suggested a need for further mon- etary policy tightening to address inflation pressures. In addition, the Bank of Japan unexpectedly widened its yield curve control band at its December meeting to ad- dress market functioning issues in the market for Japa- nese government bonds. Over the period, some other central banks communicated that they were at or near a point where it would be appropriate to pause policy rate increases and assess the effects of cumulative policy tightening. The manager pro tem turned next to a discussion of money markets and Federal Reserve operations. Money market rates were stable over the period, with the year- end passing smoothly. As expected, balances in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) fa- cility increased at year-end but quickly retraced. Market participants generally expected usage of the ON RRP fa- cility to continue a downward trend in 2023, moderating the decline in reserve balances as the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities continue to run off. Should tran- sitory pressures occur in money markets over the course of the year, the manager pro tem noted that the standing Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ repurchase agreement (repo) facility and discount win- dow would be available to help support effective mone- tary policy implementation. The manager noted that, over coming months, develop- ments affecting the Treasury General Account (TGA) and Treasury financing could influence money market conditions. An increase in TGA balances associated with April individual tax receipts could result in a tem- porary decline in reserve balances. In subsequent months, uncertainties associated with the debt limit could also be important. In particular, the Treasury could increase bill issuance to rebuild TGA balances once the debt limit is lifted, reducing reserves and po- tentially lifting money market rates. The manager pro tem noted that in recent months, investors in the ON RRP facility had responded to small increases in money market rates by shifting balances into private in- vestments, and that reductions in ON RRP volumes may help smooth adjustments in money markets. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the intermeeting period. the System’s account during Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the January 31– February 1 meeting indicated that labor market condi- tions remained tight in December, with the unemploy- ment rate at a historical low. Consumer price inflation— as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—continued to step down in November and De- cember but was still elevated. Real gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter of last year. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December, although at a slower pace than in the previ- ous two months. The unemployment rate moved back down to 3.5 percent in December. The unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, and the un- employment rate for Hispanics ticked up; the unemploy- ment rates for both groups remained above the aggre- gate measure. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-popula- tion ratio edged up. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, was flat in November and remained high. Measures of nominal wage growth slowed at the end of last year but continued to be elevated. The three-month change in the employment cost index (ECI) of hourly compensation in the private sector slowed to a 4.0 per- cent annual rate in December, while the three-month change measure of average hourly earnings (AHE) for all employees eased to an annual rate of 4.1 percent. Over the 12 months ending in December, the ECI in- creased 5.1 percent, and AHE rose 4.6 percent. Consumer price inflation eased in November and De- cember but remained elevated. Total PCE price infla- tion was 5.0 percent over the 12 months ending in De- cember, 1.1 percentage points lower than the October figure. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in December, down 0.7 percentage point from its Octo- ber reading. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.4 percent in December, 0.3 per- centage point lower than in October. The latest survey- based readings on longer-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down along with actual inflation. Although real GDP expanded at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter, real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which includes PCE, residen- tial investment, and business fixed investment—in- creased at a subdued annual rate of 0.2 percent. Real GDP growth was bolstered especially by a large gain in inventory investment and a notable contribution from net exports, as imports fell more than exports. Both in- ventories and net exports are volatile categories in aggre- gate spending. Regarding production, U.S. manufactur- ing output declined sizably in both November and De- cember. Foreign economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, weighed down by the COVID-19-related slowdown in China and repercussions of Russia’s war against Ukraine. Weaker global demand and a rebalancing from goods to services also resulted in a pronounced slowdown in manufacturing, which weighed on activity in emerging Asia. In China, the pivot away from its zero-COVID policy appears to have resulted in a rapid surge in virus cases late in the year, but also in a rebound in activity as restrictions were rapidly removed. In Europe, the slow- down in economic growth was tempered by mild winter weather, which also prompted further declines in energy _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 5 prices. A decline in retail energy as well as food prices contributed to an easing in headline consumer price in- flation in many foreign economies. With core inflation remaining elevated amid tight labor markets, however, many central banks continued to tighten monetary pol- icy. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied fed- eral funds rate path was little changed for 2023 but mod- erately moved down further out. Nominal Treasury yields were little changed, while swaps-based inflation compensation measures fell notably. Stock market in- dexes were slightly higher, and market volatility declined but remained slightly elevated. Businesses and house- holds continued to face elevated borrowing costs. Credit quality remained strong overall, although there were some signs of deterioration for consumer loans. The market-implied federal funds rate path for 2023 was little changed, on net, during the intermeeting period but fell moderately beyond mid-2024. On net, nominal Treasury yields were roughly unchanged, and swaps- market-implied inflation compensation measures fell notably. Broad stock price indexes ended the intermeeting period only slightly higher despite sizable fluctuations. Equity prices fell sharply following the December FOMC state- ment but recovered over the remainder of the period in response to data releases. The VIX—the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—decreased somewhat but remained slightly above the median range of its historical distribution. Spreads on investment- grade and high-yield corporate bonds narrowed some- what, on net, over the intermeeting period, while spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained sta- ble over the intermeeting period, with the December in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate and the associated increases in the Federal Reserve’s admin- istered rates passing through quickly to overnight money market rates. In secured markets, repo rates were roughly the same as the ON RRP offering rate but con- tinued to occasionally print slightly higher around days with Treasury bill and coupon settlements. Daily take- up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated, reflecting continued elevated assets under management (AUM) for money market mutual funds (MMFs), ongoing uncer- tainty around the policy path, and limited supply of al- ternative investments such as Treasury bills. Net yields on MMFs rose further over the intermeeting period, mostly passing through the increase in administered rates. Bank deposit rates gradually increased but contin- ued to lag cumulative increases in the federal funds rate. Over the intermeeting period, investor perceptions of an improved economic outlook in China and Europe con- tributed to increases in foreign risky asset prices and weighed on the exchange value of the dollar. Global eq- uity indexes rose, supported in part by lower European natural gas prices and China’s decision to abandon its zero-COVID policy. Sovereign yields increased notably in the euro area and Japan, reflecting more-restrictive- than-expected communications from the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan’s decision to widen its yield curve control target band, respectively. In con- trast, yields in other major advanced foreign economies were little changed on net. The staff’s broad dollar index declined over the intermeeting period, with larger de- clines against emerging market economy (EME) curren- cies amid significant inflows into EME-focused invest- ment funds in January on improved investor sentiment. Narrowing yield differentials between the United States and some advanced foreign economies also contributed to the depreciation of the dollar. In domestic credit markets, businesses and households continued to face elevated borrowing costs. Yields for corporate bonds declined, while borrowing costs for lev- eraged loans were little changed at elevated levels. Bank interest rates for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans continued to trend upward in the fourth quarter. Yields on municipal bonds declined during the intermeeting pe- riod but remained above their historical average. Resi- dential mortgage rates were little changed over the inter- meeting period and remained well above their levels in the previous tightening cycle, notwithstanding the de- cline from their peak in early November. Interest rates on existing credit cards continued to increase in recent months, and interest rates on new auto loans also rose through mid-January. Credit remained broadly available for businesses and households with strong credit quality but remained tight for lower-rated borrowers. Lending standards tightened further for bank-dependent borrowers. Issuance of cor- porate bonds was subdued in December before picking up somewhat in January. New launches of leveraged loans were notably subdued in December and January, likely reflecting soft investor demand and higher refer- ence rates on floating-rate loans. In the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported hav- ing tightened C&I and commercial real estate (CRE) Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ lending standards over the previous three months. Al- though C&I loans at banks continued to expand through December, they decelerated relative to earlier in the year, in line with tighter lending standards and weaker demand for C&I loans over the fourth quarter. CRE loan growth on domestic banks’ balance sheets remained robust in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities remained slow in November and December, amid high base interest rates and spreads. Some tightening in lending conditions was also evident for small businesses, with the share of small firms reporting that it was more difficult to obtain credit compared with three months earlier continuing to trend up through December. Credit was broadly available in the residential mortgage market for high-credit-score borrowers who met stand- ard conforming loan criteria. Credit availability for households with lower credit scores was considerably tighter, though comparable to levels prevailing before the pandemic. Purchase mortgage applications and re- finance applications were both little changed over the in- termeeting period. Home equity line of credit (HELOC) balances at banks continued to grow through the fourth quarter, on net, potentially reflecting homeowners using HELOCs as a preferred way of extracting home equity in the presence of high current mortgage rates. In the January SLOOS, banks reported tighter standards for all consumer loans. Even so, total credit card balances in- creased at a solid pace in November, while auto loans grew modestly. Overall, credit quality remained strong, although there was some deterioration for credit card and auto loan borrowers and some predictors of future credit quality worsened a bit further. The volume of corporate bond rating downgrades outpaced upgrades in December, al- though the level of downgrades remained moderate. Leveraged loans experienced notable net rating down- grades in December, but the pace moderated in January. Default rates on corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained low. Measures of expected default probabili- ties for corporate bonds and leveraged loans remained elevated relative to their historical distributions. The credit quality of businesses that borrow from banks re- mained sound, on balance, although, in the January SLOOS, banks reported expecting a deterioration in the quality of business loans in their portfolio over 2023. Delinquencies on small business loans continued to edge up in November but remained low relative to historical levels. The credit quality of households also remained strong, on balance, despite some signs of deterioration. Delin- quencies for Federal Housing Administration mortgages increased slightly, but overall mortgage delinquency rates were still near pre-pandemic lows. Delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans continued to rise during the third quarter. While delinquency rates on credit cards were still relatively low, those on auto loans rose above pre-pandemic levels. In the January SLOOS, banks reported expecting a further deterioration in the quality of household loans in 2023, especially for con- sumer loans. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate. The staff judged that asset valua- tion pressures remained notable. In particular, the staff noted that measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high, and that the potential for large declines in property prices re- mained greater than usual. In addition, the forward price-to-earnings ratio for S&P 500 firms remained above its median value despite the decline in equity prices over the past year. The staff assessed that valua- tion pressures had eased for corporate bonds and lever- aged loans, as spreads in both markets had increased from recent lows. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and business leverage remained moderate, noting that although measures of business leverage were at or near a historically high level, the ability of firms to service their debt has kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates. Household borrowing rose for bor- rowers with prime credit scores but declined for house- holds with lower credit scores. Vulnerabilities associated with financial leverage also remained moderate. In par- ticular, risk-based capital ratios for banks increased slightly, a staff measure of leverage at life insurance com- panies remained relatively flat in recent quarters, and lev- erage among private credit funds has remained steady for several years. While measures of hedge fund leverage have decreased since the pandemic shock, the staff noted that leverage among the largest funds was on track to return to 2019 levels. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were char- acterized as moderate. The rising rate environment has prompted inflows into prime retail MMFs, while AUM at prime institutional funds, which have proved more sensitive to turmoil in the past, have grown much less. Assets in open-end mutual funds that invest in less liquid _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 7 instruments like bank loans or high-yield corporate bonds have declined notably over the past year. In re- sponse to vulnerabilities at MMFs and open-end mutual funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed rules to make these funds more resilient. Staff Economic Outlook The forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff for this FOMC meeting had a somewhat higher path for the level of real GDP and a modestly lower path for the unemployment rate than in the December projection, re- flecting both the recent data and a small additional boost to output from a lower projected path for the dollar. Al- though recent data indicated that real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2022 was stronger than expected, real PDFP growth was weaker than previously forecast, and the large, unexpected boost to GDP growth from inventory investment was not projected to persist. In part reflecting the lagged effects of previous monetary policy tightening, the staff still projected real GDP growth to slow markedly this year and the labor market to soften. The staff forecast continued to include a pickup in real GDP growth starting next year, although projected output growth in 2024 and 2025 remains be- low the staff’s estimate of potential output growth. The level of real output was expected to move down to the staff’s estimate of potential near the end of 2025. Like- wise, the unemployment rate was projected to gradually move up to the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at the end of 2025. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8 percent in 2023, and core inflation was expected to be 3.2 percent, both lower than in the December projection. With the effects of supply–de- mand imbalances in goods markets expected to further unwind and labor and product markets projected to be- come less tight, the staff continued to forecast that infla- tion would decline further over 2024 and 2025. On a four-quarter change basis, core goods inflation was pro- jected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, and core nonhous- ing services inflation was forecast to slow as nominal wage growth eased. With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was pro- jected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent. The sluggish growth in real private domestic spending expected this year and the persistently tight financial conditions were seen as tilting the risks to the downside around the baseline projection for real economic activ- ity, and the staff still viewed the possibility of a recession sometime this year as a plausible alternative to the base- line. Moreover, with core PCE price inflation having slowed in recent months, along with the cumulative up- ward revisions to the core inflation projection over the past year and the expected softening in economic growth, the staff now viewed the risks around the base- line forecast for inflation this year as balanced. For be- yond this year, the staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as skewed to the upside, reflecting concerns about the potential persistence of in- flation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate remained low. Inflation had eased some- what but remained elevated. Participants recognized that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship and was contrib- uting to elevated global uncertainty. Against this back- ground, participants continued to be highly attentive to inflation risks. Participants agreed that cumulative policy firming to date had reduced demand in the most interest-rate-sen- sitive sectors of the economy, particularly housing. Par- ticipants observed that growth in economic activity in 2022 had been below its longer-run trend and expected that real GDP growth would slow further in 2023. While real GDP growth had rebounded in the second half of 2022, several participants noted that growth in PDFP had nearly stalled in the fourth quarter. With inflation remaining unacceptably high, participants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby reduce inflationary pressures. Some participants judged that recent eco- nomic data signaled a somewhat higher chance of con- tinued subdued economic growth, with inflation falling over time to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 per- cent, although some participants noted that the proba- bility of the economy entering a recession in 2023 re- mained elevated. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that real consumer spending had declined in November and December—in part reflecting the tight- ening in financial conditions over the past year—and an- ticipated that consumption would likely grow at a sub- dued rate in 2023. Participants noted that excess savings accumulated during the pandemic had continued to sup- port consumption, although several participants re- marked that the importance of this factor would likely wane over time as excess savings continued to be drawn down or eroded by inflation. A couple of participants observed that some consumers were shifting their spending to less expensive alternatives. A few partici- pants noted the effects of higher interest costs in re- straining consumption or inhibiting the ability of some households to repay their loans, while a couple of par- ticipants noted that inflation was eroding households’ purchasing power. However, a couple of participants noted that some states could return part of their sizable budget surpluses to households through tax cuts or re- bates, which would provide support to consumption. Participants agreed that activity in the housing market had continued to weaken, largely reflecting the increase in mortgage rates over the past year. Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment spending had been subdued in the fourth quarter and was being restrained by past interest rate increases. A number of participants commented that supply bottlenecks continued to ease, although supply chain issues remained a challenge in some sectors. Several participants remarked that the re- cent strong growth in inventory investment will likely slow; a couple of those participants noted that busi- nesses appeared more confident that significant supply bottlenecks would not reemerge and might therefore choose to hold smaller inventories. Some participants commented that the easing of COVID-related lockdown restrictions in China or stronger-than-expected growth in economic activity in the euro area could provide sup- port to final demand in the United States. Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight and assessed that labor demand substantially ex- ceeded the supply of available workers. Participants noted that the unemployment rate had returned to a his- torically low level in December, job vacancies remained high, and wage growth remained elevated. Several par- ticipants noted that recent reductions in the workforces of some large technology businesses followed much larger increases over the previous few years and judged that these reductions did not appear to reflect wide- spread weakness in the demand for labor. A few partic- ipants remarked that some business contacts appeared keen to retain workers even in the face of slowing de- mand for output because of their recent experiences of labor shortages and hiring challenges. Participants agreed that labor supply remained constrained by struc- tural factors such as the effects from the pandemic, in- cluding those on early retirements, and the reduced avail- ability and increased cost of childcare. Nevertheless, participants noted tentative signs that imbalances be- tween demand and supply in the labor market were im- proving, with job vacancies and payroll gains declining somewhat from high levels, the average number of hours worked falling, and growth in wages and employ- ment costs slowing. Some participants commented on the recent reduction in temporary employment, which previously had often preceded more widespread reduc- tions in labor demand. Under appropriate monetary policy, participants expected labor market demand and supply to come into better balance over time, easing up- ward pressure on nominal wages and prices. A number of participants commented on the importance of recog- nizing that, to the extent national unemployment in- creases, historical evidence indicates that even larger in- creases in the unemployment rate for some demographic groups—particularly African Americans and Hispan- ics—would be likely to occur. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. A number of participants com- mented that the costs of elevated inflation are particu- larly high for lower-income households. Participants noted that inflation data received over the past three months showed a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases but stressed that substantially more evidence of progress across a broader range of prices would be required to be confident that inflation was on a sustained downward path. Participants noted that core goods prices had declined notably over the pre- vious few months as supply bottlenecks had eased but anticipated that price declines for this component would dissipate as the downward pressure on goods prices from resolving supply bottlenecks fades. Participants judged that housing services inflation would likely begin to fall later this year, reflecting continued smaller in- creases, or potentially declines, in rents on new leases. Participants agreed that they had observed less evidence of a slowdown in the rate of increase of prices for core services excluding housing, a category that accounts for more than half of the core PCE price index. Participants judged that as long as the labor market remained very _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 9 tight, wage growth in excess of 2 percent inflation and trend productivity growth would likely continue to put upward pressure on some prices in this component. A couple of participants observed that changes in wages tend to lag changes in prices, which can complicate the assessment of inflation pressures. A couple of partici- pants remarked that the poor performance of labor productivity growth last year was restraining aggregate supply, which was contributing to imbalances between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and therefore to upward pressure on inflation. Several participants noted the possibility that as consumers become more price sensitive, businesses might accept lower profit margins in an effort to maintain market share, which could re- duce inflation temporarily. Participants observed that indicators of short-term inflation expectations from sur- veys of households and businesses as well as from finan- cial markets had come down and that longer-term infla- tion expectations remained well anchored. A number of participants noted the importance of longer-term infla- tion expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. In that adverse scenario, it would be more costly to bring inflation down to achieve the Committee’s statutory ob- jectives of maximum employment and price stability. Participants observed that financial conditions remained much tighter than in early 2022. However, several par- ticipants observed that some measures of financial con- ditions had eased over the past few months. A few par- ticipants noted that increased confidence among market participants that inflation would fall quickly appeared to contribute to declines in market expectations of the fed- eral funds rate path beyond the near term. Participants noted that it was important that overall financial condi- tions be consistent with the degree of policy restraint that the Committee is putting into place in order to bring inflation back to the 2 percent goal. Participants observed that the uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation was high. Regarding upside risks to inflation, participants cited a variety of factors, including the possibility that price pressures could prove to be more persistent than anticipated due to, for example, the labor market staying tight for longer than anticipated. Participants also saw a number of upside risks surround- ing the outlook for inflation stemming from factors abroad, such as China’s relaxation of its zero-COVID policies and Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine. However, a few participants remarked that the risks to their inflation outlook had become more balanced. Par- ticipants agreed that the risks to the outlook for eco- nomic activity were weighted to the downside. Partici- pants noted that sources of such risks included the pro- spect of unexpected negative shocks tipping the econ- omy into a recession in an environment of subdued growth, the effects of synchronous policy firming by ma- jor central banks, and disruptions in the financial system and broader economy associated with concerns that the statutory debt limit might not be raised in a timely man- ner. In their discussion of issues related to financial stability, several participants discussed vulnerabilities in the finan- cial system associated with higher interest rates, includ- ing the elevated valuations for some categories of assets, particularly in the CRE sector; the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs; and the effect of large, unrealized losses on some banks’ securities port- folios. A few participants commented that international stresses had the potential to transmit to the U.S. financial system. A number of participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities and stressed the importance of the appropriate authorities continuing to address issues related to the re- silience of the market. Although several participants noted that the Federal Reserve’s standing liquidity facil- ities could be helpful in addressing significant pressures in funding markets, should they arise, several partici- pants also noted the challenges of addressing potential disruptions in U.S. core market functioning. A few par- ticipants remarked that recent failures of companies in- volved in crypto finance have had a limited effect on the broader financial system. These participants indicated that this limited effect reflected the minimal extent of the crypto market’s connections to the banking system thus far, consistent with the risks associated with many of these activities. Several participants discussed the value of the Federal Reserve taking additional steps to understand the potential risks associated with climate change or to assess the materiality of such risks in the context of carrying out its responsibilities to evaluate risks in the banking system and broader financial system. A number of participants stressed that a drawn-out pe- riod of negotiations to raise the federal debt limit could pose significant risks to the financial system and the broader economy. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that the Committee had made significant progress over the past year in moving toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of monetary policy. Even so, participants agreed that, Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ while there were recent signs that the cumulative effect of the Committee’s tightening of the stance of monetary policy had begun to moderate inflationary pressures, in- flation remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and the labor market remained very tight, contributing to continuing upward pressures on wages and prices. Against this backdrop, and in consid- eration of the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. Many of these participants observed that a further slow- ing in the pace of rate increases would better allow them to assess the economy’s progress toward the Commit- tee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability as they determine the extent of future policy tightening that will be required to attain a stance that is sufficiently restrictive to achieve these goals. A few participants stated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported raising the target by that amount. The participants favoring a 50-basis point in- crease noted that a larger increase would more quickly bring the target range close to the levels they believed would achieve a sufficiently restrictive stance, taking into account their views of the risks to achieving price stabil- ity in a timely way. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Fed- eral Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in its pre- viously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, with inflation still well above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market remaining very tight, all participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. Participants affirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appropriate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. Participants observed that a restrictive policy stance would need to be maintained until the incoming data provided confidence that inflation was on a sustained downward path to 2 percent, which was likely to take some time. Participants discussed the heightened uncertainty re- garding the economic outlook and a number of factors that could affect inflation and real economic activity. Participants generally noted that the Committee’s future decisions regarding policy would continue to be in- formed by the incoming data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation. A num- ber of participants observed that financial conditions had eased in recent months, which some noted could necessitate a tighter stance of monetary policy. Participants also discussed a number of risk-manage- ment considerations related to the conduct of monetary policy. Almost all participants observed that slowing the pace of rate increases at the current juncture would allow for appropriate risk management as the Committee as- sessed the extent of further tightening needed to meet the Committee’s goals. Several of those participants ob- served that risks to the economic outlook were becom- ing more balanced. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal, participants generally noted that upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook, and that main- taining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a path toward 2 percent is appropriate from a risk- management perspective. A number of participants ob- served that a policy stance that proved to be insuffi- ciently restrictive could halt recent progress in moderat- ing inflationary pressures, leading inflation to remain above the Committee’s 2 percent objective for a longer period, and pose a risk of inflation expectations becom- ing unanchored. Participants noted that the runoff of the balance sheet had been proceeding smoothly. A few participants ob- served that money markets could experience some tem- porary pressures as reserves declined if use of the Fed- eral Reserve’s ON RRP facility continued to remain high. They noted, however, that such pressures, should they occur, would likely cause an upward re-pricing of private money-market rates that could encourage market participants to reduce their use of the facility. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod- est growth in spending and production. Members also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members agreed that inflation had eased somewhat but remained elevated. Members concurred that Russia’s war against Ukraine was causing tremendous human and economic hardship and was contributing to elevated global uncertainty. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of January 31–February 1, 2023Page 11 Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4½ to 4¾ percent. Members anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be ap- propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 per- cent over time. Members concurred that, in determining the extent of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue reducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee remained strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective February 2, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4½ to 4¾ percent. • Conduct overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 4.75 percent and with an aggregate opera- tion limit of $500 billion; the aggregate op- eration limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Conduct overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per day; the per-coun- terparty limit can be temporarily increased at the discretion of the Chair. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are the monthly cap. than less • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has remained low. Inflation has eased somewhat but remains elevated. Russia’s war against Ukraine is causing tremen- dous human and economic hardship and is con- tributing to elevated global uncertainty. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4½ to 4¾ percent. The Committee anticipates that ongoing in- creases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2 percent over time. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, the Com- mittee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None.

The Vice Chair for Supervision described the developments, in- cluding those at Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit Suisse. He also described actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies in re- sponse. He noted that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. He also noted that he will be leading a re- view of the supervision and regulation of Silicon Valley Bank, and that the Federal Reserve System will apply what is learned from the review to strengthen its super- visory and regulatory practices as appropriate. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of U.S. financial market developments over the intermeeting period. Early in the period, firmer-than-expected data and policy communications pushed interest rates higher and equity prices lower. Developments in the banking sector later in the period were met with sharp reductions in Treasury yields, particularly at shorter tenors. Treasury market li- quidity was poor and implied volatility was high, but the market remained functional amid substantial trading ac- tivity. Higher Treasury market volatility contributed to wider spreads for household and business borrowing. Financial conditions tightened considerably over the in- termeeting period as a whole. Market contacts observed that the recent developments in the banking system will likely result in a pullback in bank lending, which would not be reflected in most common financial conditions indexes. Following the banking-sector developments, equity prices for large U.S. banks underperformed the broad market; equity prices for U.S. regional banks gen- erally underperformed by relatively more. Regarding the outlook for inflation in the United States, market-based measures of inflation compensation over shorter horizons rose over the period, although com- pensation retraced a good portion of its increase later in the period as markets reacted to the developments in the inflation compensation banking sector. measures continued to indicate that longer-term infla- tion expectations remained well anchored. Measures of inflation expectations from the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic- ipants moved higher at shorter horizons and were little changed at longer horizons. Forward Regarding the outlook for monetary policy, market- based measures of policy expectations suggested that the federal funds rate would reach a peak in May 2023 and that the target range would then move lower. However, the medians of respondents’ modal expectations of the federal funds rate from the Desk surveys did not show any declines in the target range through the end of 2023. Risk and liquidity premiums embedded in market prices may have driven a good part of the difference between survey and market measures. The median respondent expected the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2023 and 2024 to shift 25 basis points higher. However, in- formation gathered after the Desk surveys closed sug- gests that those expectations had declined some, to a level comparable with the December SEP. Survey re- sponses suggested only modest changes in expectations for balance sheet policy. The manager turned next to a discussion of operations and money markets. Federal funds volumes fell sharply for a few days late in the period as Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) sought to maintain liquidity in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks. Money market rates remained broadly stable, and se- cured and unsecured money market rates, including the effective fed funds rate, traded well within the target range. Use of U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with for- eign central banks had been minimal, indicating that market participants did not face significant difficulties in obtaining dollar funding from private sources. Borrowing from the new Bank Term Funding Program had been small relative to discount window borrowing, which had increased to record levels. Use of the over- night reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility fell, especially for money market mutual funds (MMFs), as the supply of short-term securities at attractive rates increased. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. inflation—as measured by Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the March 21– 22 meeting indicated that labor market conditions re- mained tight in January and February, with robust job gains and the unemployment rate near a historical low. the Consumer price 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—was still elevated in January. Real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Although financial market data had shown reactions to developments in the banking sector late in the intermeet- ing period, there were essentially no economic data avail- able that covered this period. Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a faster monthly pace in January and February than in the fourth quarter of last year. The unemployment rate was little changed and stood at 3.6 percent in February. Over the past two months, the unemployment rate for African Americans was unchanged, on net, and the unemploy- ment rate for Hispanics moved up; the unemployment rates for both groups remained above the aggregate measure. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio increased slightly. The private-sector job openings rate in January—as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey—was little changed, on balance, since November and remained high. Recent indicators of nominal wage growth had slowed but continued to be elevated. In February, the 3-month change in average hourly earnings for all employees was at an annual rate of 3.6 percent, slower than its 12-month pace of 4.6 percent. Over the four quarters of 2022, total labor compensation per hour in the business sector—as measured by the Productivity and Costs data—increased 4.5 percent, below its pace in the previous year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated early in the year. Total PCE price inflation was 5.4 percent over the 12 months ending in January, and core PCE price infla- tion—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 4.7 per- cent. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent in January. In February, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 6.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.5 percent. The CPI, along with data from the producer price index, pointed to some slowing in PCE price inflation in Feb- ruary. The latest survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the Survey of Professional Fore- casters, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in recent months, while near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down. Real GDP growth seemed to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Gains in consumer spending had picked up in recent months, but growth in business fixed investment was slowing and residential investment was continuing to decline. After contracting over the second half of last year, manufacturing output expanded moderately, on average, over January and February, but near-term indicators—such as national and regional in- dexes for new orders—pointed to softening factory out- put in the coming months. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit registered a record high in 2022. The trade deficit had been narrow- ing since March of last year but resumed widening in De- cember and January. Real goods imports rose in Decem- ber and January, led by increases in imports of consumer goods and automotive products. Real goods exports also increased, but by less than imports. Indicators suggested that foreign economic growth re- bounded in the first quarter of 2023 as China reopened rapidly from its COVID-19-related shutdowns and Eu- rope’s economy proved to be resilient to the energy price shock stemming from Russia’s war against Ukraine and benefited from a mild winter that reduced energy de- mand. Manufacturing activity in emerging Asia showed signs of a turnaround from its pronounced slowdown since mid-2022. The recent developments in the bank- ing sector led to some tightening of financial conditions abroad. Oil prices edged down despite China’s rapid re- opening and the implementation of the European Un- ion’s embargo on Russian refined oil products. Retail energy inflation continued to slow, contributing to an easing of headline consumer price inflation in many ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs). In contrast, core in- flation has shown little sign of easing in most foreign economies amid tight labor markets. In response, many foreign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening, although some have either paused or indi- cated that a pause soon was possible, citing the im- portance of assessing the cumulative effects of past pol- icy rate increases. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the first several weeks of the intermeeting period, incoming economic data and FOMC communications appeared to refocus market participants on upside risks to inflation and policy rates, with the market-implied policy rate path steepening, nominal Treasury yields ris- ing, near-term inflation compensation measures increas- ing, and broad stock market price indexes declining. Fi- nancing conditions for businesses, households, and mu- nicipalities had tightened during this period and were moderately restrictive overall, as borrowing costs in- creased notably with the expected path of policy rates and Treasury yields and as some lenders appeared to tighten nonprice borrowing terms. Nonetheless, lending volumes were generally solid. Credit quality was strong Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ overall, although it had worsened a bit for some borrow- ers. Expectations for future credit quality continued to deteriorate in some markets. Pricing in financial markets changed notably in the latter part of the intermeeting period, amid developments in the banking sector. Treasury yields and policy rate ex- pectations moved down significantly, while broad stock price indexes rose somewhat. The market-implied pol- icy rate path shifted down sizably, with the federal funds rate expected to peak in May before decreasing after- ward. Further out, OIS (overnight index swap) quotes at the end of the intermeeting period indicated that the expected federal funds rate at year-end 2024 was 3.28 percent, about 50 basis points lower than before the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank but somewhat higher than at the time of the February FOMC meeting. Treasury yields declined, especially at shorter maturities, reflecting downward revisions in pol- icy rate expectations and the effects of flight to safety. Inflation compensation declined, especially at short ma- turities, likely reflecting, in part, a relatively larger decline in risk premiums on nominal Treasury securities relative to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities due to strong safe-haven demands. Late in the intermeeting period, U.S. bank stock prices declined notably. Regional banks with unusually large reliance on uninsured deposits and holdings of securities with significant unrealized mark-to-market losses expe- rienced larger declines in stock prices. Broad equity prices rose somewhat after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, reportedly driven by inves- tors’ reassessment of the outlook for interest rates, and after the announcement that UBS had agreed to buy Credit Suisse. The VIX—the one-month option- implied volatility on the S&P 500—increased to about 26.5 percent following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, but it subsequently declined to 21 percent—around the 70th percentile of its histori- cal distribution. Swaption-implied volatilities of short- term interest rates increased notably during this period, reflecting increased uncertainty about the interest rate outlook. Some of the pricing moves in asset markets may have been amplified by impaired liquidity condi- tions. Despite deteriorating liquidity conditions in Treasury, bond, and equity markets, market functioning remained orderly. Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were volatile as investors’ focus shifted from resilience in economic activity and stubbornly high core inflation across advanced economies earlier in the period to stresses in the global banking sector more recently. Ear- lier in the period, yields and market-based measures of inflation expectations in the AFEs increased notably, driven by spillovers from U.S. Treasury yields as well as upside surprises in economic and inflation data for AFEs. Later in the period, developments in the banking sector led to large declines in advanced-economy yields, and, on net, AFE yields declined slightly. Additionally, for the intermeeting period overall, the staff’s dollar in- dex rose moderately, corporate and emerging market economy sovereign credit spreads widened, and foreign equity indexes generally moved lower, with bank equities falling notably. U.S. unsecured funding markets showed some signs of pressure later in the intermeeting period. Issuance of commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of de- posit (NCDs) dropped a touch over the entire period, and the fraction of CP issuance with overnight maturi- ties increased but remained within normal ranges. Spreads of term CP and NCDs widened some, and spreads for issuers with lower credit ratings rose more, but other unsecured spreads remained within normal ranges. Prime MMFs experienced outflows, while gov- ernment MMFs had inflows. The effective federal funds rate was little changed after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Amid these developments, federal funds volumes ini- tially declined sharply as the FHLBs reduced their activ- ity in the federal funds market in order to meet increased demand for advances by member banks; market volume subsequently rebounded partially. Activity in the repur- chase agreement market was robust, and trading volume remained within recent ranges. ON RRP take-up re- mained within recent ranges as well. Borrowing costs for businesses, households, and munic- ipalities rose notably in the early part of the intermeeting period, mostly in line with increases in the federal funds rate and Treasury yields. Since the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, spreads on corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and leveraged loans rose, with speculative-grade corporate bond spreads registering the largest moves; spreads remained at moderate levels rela- tive to their historical distributions. Investment-grade corporate yields and municipal yields were down mod- erately, whereas speculative-grade corporate yields and leveraged loan yields were up modestly. Mortgage rates were unchanged amid an increase in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) spreads. Based on data that do not cover the period following the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ nonprice terms and standards appeared to tighten some- what in a number of markets. Nevertheless, generally solid funding flows suggest that most firms and house- holds had remained broadly able to access funding. Data on credit conditions following the developments in the banking sector were limited. After the two bank clo- sures, issuance of municipal bond and leveraged loans was sluggish, and gross issuance of corporate bonds fell to near zero. Mortgage loans to households remained available. The credit quality of businesses and households was largely stable over the intermeeting period. However, measures of credit performance showed some signs of weakening. Leveraged loan credit quality deteriorated somewhat after the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Credit quality for residential mortgages remained unchanged. Staff Economic Outlook For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy pre- pared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential eco- nomic effects of the recent banking-sector develop- ments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was pro- jected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff’s estimate of its nat- ural rate early next year. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was forecast to be 2.8 percent this year, with core infla- tion at 3.5 percent. Core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain sub- dued; housing services inflation was expected to peak later this year and then move down, while core nonhous- ing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the ef- fects of less projected tightness in product and labor markets, core inflation was forecast to slow sharply next year. With steep declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation expected for this year, total inflation was projected to step down markedly this year and then to track core inflation over the following two years. In 2024 and 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be near 2 percent. The staff judged that the uncertainty around the baseline projection was much greater than at the time of the pre- vious forecast. In particular, the staff viewed the risks around the baseline projection as determined im- portantly by banking conditions and the implications for financial conditions. If the effects of the recent devel- opments in the banking sector on macroeconomic con- ditions were to abate quickly, then the risks around the baseline would be tilted to the upside for both economic activity and inflation. If banking and financial condi- tions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for both economic activity and inflation, particularly because historical recessions related to finan- cial market problems tend to be more severe and persis- tent than average recessions. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. An SEP was released to the public following the conclu- sion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that recent indicators pointed to modest growth in spending and production. At the same time, though, participants noted that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation re- mained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. bank- ing system remained sound and resilient. They com- mented that recent developments in the banking sector were likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. Participants agreed that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Against this Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ background, participants continued to be highly atten- tive to inflation risks. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that since they met in February, data on inflation, em- ployment, and economic activity generally came in stronger than expected. They also noted, however, that the developments in the banking sector that had oc- curred late in the intermeeting period affected their views of the economic and policy outlook and the un- certainty surrounding that outlook. Based on incoming economic data, participants’ assessments of the effects of cumulative policy firming, and their initial views on the likely economic effect of the recent banking-sector developments, participants generally expected real GDP to grow this year at a pace well below its long-run trend rate. With inflation remaining unacceptably high, partic- ipants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP would be needed to bring aggregate demand into better balance with aggregate supply and thereby re- duce inflationary pressures. Many participants remarked that the incoming data before the onset of the banking- sector stresses had led them to see the appropriate path for the federal funds rate as somewhat higher than their assessment at the time of the December meeting. After incorporating the banking-sector developments, partici- pants indicated that their policy rate projections were now about unchanged from December. Participants agreed that the actions taken so far by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other government agencies, as well as actions taken by foreign authorities to address banking and financial stresses outside the U.S., had helped calm conditions in the banking sector. Even with the actions, participants recognized that there was significant uncertainty as to how those conditions would evolve. Participants assessed that the develop- ments so far would likely lead to some weakening of credit conditions, as some banks were likely to tighten lending standards amid rising funding costs and in- creased concerns about liquidity. Participants noted that it was too early to assess with confidence the magnitude of the effect of a credit tightening on economic activity and inflation, and that it was important to continue to closely monitor developments and update assessments of the actual and expected effects of credit tightening. Several participants noted that regional and community banks, a small number of which had come under signif- icant stress, were important in small business and mid- dle-market lending and were providing critical and unique financial services to many communities and in- dustries. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that incoming data on real consumer expenditures showed a pickup in spending in January and February. They attributed the pickup to strong job gains, rising real disposable income, and households continuing to run down excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. They also noted that an atypically warm start to this year, along with challenges in seasonally adjusting data, likely contributed to the pickup in the reported data. A few participants observed that credit card delinquencies, par- ticularly for lower-income households, had risen in the face of elevated inflation and higher nominal interest rates. Participants noted that recent developments in the banking sector and the associated rise in uncertainty would likely weigh on consumer sentiment and that in- creased caution on the part of consumers could restrain spending. A couple of participants observed that high- frequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown a significant change following the recent devel- opments in the banking sector, although they also acknowledged that the situation was fluid. Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was being re- strained by tighter financial conditions that reflected cu- mulative policy firming to date. Participants expected the likely tightening of credit conditions due to the re- cent developments in the banking sector to further weigh on investment spending. In addition, the bank- ing-sector developments could damp business confi- dence and increase firms’ caution, reducing their willing- ness to hire new workers. However, a few participants mentioned that their nonbank business contacts re- ported that the banking-sector developments so far had not resulted in significant changes in their hiring and capital spending plans or sales expectations, though their contacts also acknowledged increased uncertainties around their outlooks. Participants agreed that the labor market remained very tight. Job gains had picked up to a robust pace in Janu- ary and February, and the unemployment rate remained low. Participants noted some signs of improvement in the imbalances between demand and supply in the labor market, including further declines in the quits rate as well as an increase in the overall labor force participation rate and the return of the prime-age participation rate to pre- pandemic levels. Furthermore, participants observed that wage growth appeared to be slowing gradually amid this apparent easing in labor demand and increase in la- bor supply. However, participants assessed that labor demand continued to substantially exceed labor supply, and several participants pointed out that wage growth Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ was still well above the rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objec- tive, given current estimates of trend productivity growth. Participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, supply and demand conditions in the labor market will come into better balance over time, easing upward pressures on wages and prices. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal of 2 percent, participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. Participants commented that re- cent inflation data indicated slower-than-expected pro- gress on disinflation. In particular, they noted that revi- sions to the price data had indicated less disinflation at the end of last year than had been previously reported and that inflation was still quite elevated. Participants noted that, on a 12-month basis, core goods price infla- tion declined as supply chains continued to improve, but the pace of the decline had slowed, highlighting the still uncertain nature of the disinflationary process. Partici- pants expected that housing services inflation would likely begin to slow in coming months, reflecting contin- ued smaller increases, or potentially declines, in rents on new leases. Regarding prices for core services excluding housing, participants agreed that there was little evidence pointing to disinflation in this component. Participants generally judged that some more easing in labor market tightness and slowing in nominal wage growth would be necessary for sustained disinflation. Additionally, partic- ipants observed that indicators of short-term inflation expectations from surveys of households and businesses had come down further, while longer-term inflation ex- pectations remained well anchored. Participants also discussed the potential effect on inflation of the devel- opments in the banking sector. They noted that a tight- ening of credit conditions was likely to weigh on aggre- gate demand, which in turn could help reduce inflation- ary pressures. However, participants observed that the size of such an effect was highly uncertain. Participants generally observed that the recent develop- ments in the banking sector had further increased the already-high level of uncertainty associated with their outlooks for economic activity, the labor market, and in- flation. Participants saw risks to economic activity as weighted to the downside. As a source of downside risk to activity, they noted the possibility that banks would reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, which could restrain economic activity significantly. Participants mentioned potential intensification of Rus- sia’s war against Ukraine as an additional source of downside risk to the economic outlook. Participants generally saw risks to inflation as weighted to the upside, though they also recognized some downside risks to in- flation. As a source of upside risk to inflation, partici- pants cited the possibility of more-persistent-than- anticipated price pressures, due to, for example, surpris- ingly resilient labor demand. As a source of downside risk to inflation, participants noted that if banks reduce the supply of credit by more than expected, the likely restraint on economic activity and hiring could put addi- tional downward pressure on inflation. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that infla- tion remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent and that the recent data on inflation provided few signs that inflation pressures were abating at a pace sufficient to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants also noted that recent developments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, though the ex- tent of these effects was highly uncertain. Against this backdrop, all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 ba- sis points to 4¾ to 5 percent. All participants also agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as de- scribed in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. Several participants noted that, in their policy delibera- tions, they considered whether it would be appropriate to hold the target range steady at this meeting. They noted that doing so would allow more time to assess the financial and economic effects of recent banking-sector developments and of the cumulative tightening of mon- etary policy. However, these participants also observed that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordi- nation with other government agencies helped calm con- ditions in the banking sector and lessen the near-term risks to economic activity and inflation. Consequently, these participants judged it appropriate to increase the target range 25 basis points because of elevated inflation, the strength of the recent economic data, and their com- mitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. Some participants noted that given persistently high in- flation and the strength of the recent economic data, they would have considered a 50 basis point increase in the target range to have been appropriate at this meeting in the absence of the recent developments in the banking sector. However, due to the potential for banking-sector developments to tighten financial conditions and to Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ weigh on economic activity and inflation, they judged it prudent to increase the target range by a smaller incre- ment at this meeting. These participants noted that do- ing so would also allow the Committee time to better assess the effects of banking-sector developments on credit conditions and the economy as the Committee moved toward a sufficiently restrictive stance of mone- tary policy. Participants observed that the actions taken by the Fed- eral Reserve in coordination with other government agencies in the days preceding the meeting had served to calm conditions in the banking sector. Participants noted that the most significant issues appeared to have been limited to a small number of banks with poor risk- management practices and that the banking system re- mained sound and resilient. Participants emphasized that the Federal Reserve should use its liquidity and lender-of-last-resort tools, as well as its microprudential and macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools, to address stress in the banking sector and to mitigate fu- ture financial stability risks. Participants agreed that re- cent banking developments would factor into the Com- mittee’s monetary policy decisions to the extent that these developments affect the outlook for employment and inflation and the risks surrounding the outlook. Par- ticipants reaffirmed their strong commitment to return- ing inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. In discussing the policy outlook, participants observed that inflation remained much too high and that the labor market remained tight; as a result, they anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate to at- tain a sufficiently restrictive policy stance to return infla- tion to 2 percent over time. Many participants noted that the likely effects of recent banking-sector develop- ments on economic activity and inflation had led them to lower their assessments of the federal funds rate target range that would be sufficiently restrictive compared with assessments based solely on the recent economic data. In determining the extent of future increases in the target range, participants judged that it would be appro- priate to take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In light of the highly uncertain economic outlook, par- ticipants underscored the importance of closely moni- toring incoming information and assessing the implica- tions for future monetary policy decisions. Participants noted that it would be particularly important to review incoming information regarding changes in credit con- ditions and credit flows as well as broader changes in fi- nancial conditions and to assess the implications for eco- nomic activity, labor markets, and inflation. Several par- ticipants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality in determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy given the highly uncertain economic outlook. Participants emphasized a number of risk-management considerations related to the conduct of monetary pol- icy. Some participants observed that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the risk that banking-sector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Some participants also noted that, with inflation still well above the Commit- tee’s longer-run goal and the recent economic data re- maining strong, upside risks to the inflation outlook re- mained a key factor shaping the policy outlook, and that maintaining a restrictive policy stance until inflation is clearly on a downward path toward 2 percent would be appropriate from a risk-management perspective. Sev- eral participants noted the importance of longer-term in- flation expectations remaining anchored and remarked that the longer inflation remained elevated, the greater the risk of inflation expectations becoming unanchored. Participants generally agreed on the importance of closely monitoring incoming information and its impli- cations for the economic outlook, and that they were prepared to adjust their views on the appropriate stance of monetary policy in response to the incoming data and emerging risks to the economic outlook. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that recent indicators pointed to mod- est growth in spending and production. They also con- curred that job gains had picked up in recent months and were running at a robust pace, that the unemployment rate had remained low, and that inflation remains ele- vated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. They also agreed that recent de- velopments were likely to result in tighter credit condi- tions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the ex- tent of these effects was uncertain. Members also con- curred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, Minutes of the Meeting of March 21–22, 2023Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent. Members agreed that they would closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. Given recent de- velopments, members anticipated that some additional policy firming may be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Members con- curred that, in determining the extent of future increases in the target range, they would take into account the cu- mulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and in- flation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they would continue re- ducing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury secu- rities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they remained strongly committed to returning in- flation to its 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers agreed that their assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation ex- pectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 23, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 4¾ to 5 percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5 percent and with an aggregate op- eration limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 4.8 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are the monthly cap. than less • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production. Job gains have picked up in recent months and are running at a robust pace; the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Recent developments are likely to result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses and to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects is uncertain. The Committee remains highly at- tentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 4¾ to 5 percent. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. The Committee anticipates that some additional policy firming may be ap- propriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return in- flation to 2 percent over time. In determining Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.9 per- cent, effective March 23, 2023.

Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Asset prices were less volatile and financial market conditions eased somewhat over the intermeeting period as investor sentiment around the banking system stabilized. On net, nominal Treasury yields declined, equities appreciated, credit spreads tightened, and the trade-weighted value of the dollar de- preciated. Measures of implied volatility declined across markets. Policy-sensitive rates, however, fluctu- ated a fair amount over the period, particularly in re- sponse to economic data but also because of market perceptions of risk and liquidity conditions. Treasury market liquidity improved somewhat over the period but remained challenged. Treasury cash and futures markets continued to function in an orderly manner de- spite the lower-than-normal liquidity. Regarding developments late in the intermeeting pe- riod, the closure and acquisition of First Republic Bank were seen as orderly, though investors remained fo- cused on stresses in the banking sector. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department announced it may not be able to fully satisfy the federal government’s obligations as early as June 1 if the debt limit is not raised or sus- pended, but that the actual date this event would occur might come a number of weeks later. Yields on Treas- ury bills and coupon securities maturing in the first half of June increased notably amid significant volatility. Deposit outflows from small and mid-sized banks largely stopped in late March and April. Although eq- uity prices for regional banks fell further over the pe- riod, for the vast majority of banks these declines ap- peared primarily to reflect expectations for lower prof- itability rather than solvency concerns. Market partici- pants remained alert to the possibility of another inten- sification of banking stress. Responses to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants suggest that investors’ macroeconomic outlooks were little changed from March despite ongoing focus on the im- plications of the expected tightening of credit. Re- spondents saw upside inflation risks, albeit less than in March. Market participants broadly expected a 25 basis point rate increase at the May meeting and saw the resulting rate as the likely peak for the current tightening cycle. Survey respondents assigned a much higher probability to the peak federal funds rate being between 5 and 5.25 percent than they did in March. However, re- spondents still assigned a substantial probability that the peak rate may turn out to be above 5.25 percent. Re- spondents expected the peak rate to be maintained through the January 2024 FOMC meeting. Regarding the balance sheet and money markets, bal- ance sheet runoff continued to proceed smoothly and overnight secured and unsecured rates continued to trade well within the target range for the federal funds rate. Respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally ex- pected that overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) balances will remain elevated in the near term before declining later this year. The ON RRP fa- cility continued to support effective policy implementa- tion and control over the federal funds rate, providing a strong floor for money market rates. Balances at the ON RRP facility remained within their recent range, in- dicating that use of the facility was not an important factor driving outflows of deposits from the banking system. Use of the ON RRP facility declined at times over the intermeeting period in response to increases in rates on overnight secured money market instruments and on short-term Federal Home Loan Bank debt. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In addition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss National Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. the time of information available at Staff Review of the Economic Situation the The May 2–3 meeting indicated that real gross domestic product (GDP) had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Labor market conditions remained tight in March, as job gains were robust and the unemploy- ment rate was low. Consumer price inflation—as meas- ured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—con- tinued to be elevated in March. Limited data were avail- able on economic activity during the period after the onset of banking-sector stress in mid-March, although several recent surveys—such as the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) in April, the National Federation of Independent Busi- ness’s survey in March, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations in March—indicated that bank credit conditions were tightening further. The pace of increases in total nonfarm payroll employ- ment slowed in March but was still robust, and the un- employment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent. The un- employment rate for African Americans fell to 5.0 per- cent, and the jobless rate for Hispanics dropped to 4.6 percent. The aggregate measures of both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-popula- tion ratio edged up. The private-sector job openings rate—as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey—moved down markedly during Feb- ruary and March but remained high. Recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to ease from their peaks recorded last year but were still elevated. Over the 12 months ending in March, average hourly earnings for all employees rose 4.2 percent, well below its peak of 5.9 percent a year earlier. Over the year ending in March, the employment cost index (ECI) for private-sector workers increased 4.8 percent, down from its peak of 5.5 percent over the year ending in June of last year. Consumer price inflation remained elevated in March but continued to slow. Total PCE price inflation was 4.2 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices—was 4.6 percent; the total inflation measure was down markedly from its level in January, while the core measure was only slightly lower. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.7 percent in March. The latest survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers in April and the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations in March remained within the range of their values reported in recent months; near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved up but were still below their peaks seen last year. Real GDP growth was modest in the first quarter, led by an increase in PCE. Gains in consumer spending picked up for the quarter as a whole, driven by a surge in January that was followed by a small net decline over February and March. Light motor vehicle sales, how- ever, picked up notably in April. Growth in business fixed investment slowed further in the first quarter, and new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding air- craft continued to decline in March, pointing to weak- ness in capital goods shipments in the near term. Resi- dential investment declined further in the first quarter but at a slower pace than last year. Net exports made a small positive contribution to GDP growth in the first quarter, as exports rebounded more strongly than im- ports from their fourth-quarter declines. U.S. manufac- turing output fell in March, and near-term indicators— such as national and regional indexes for new orders— pointed to more softening in factory output in the com- ing months. Foreign economic activity rebounded in the first quar- ter, reflecting the reopening of China’s economy from its COVID-19-related shutdowns, a pickup in the econ- omies of Canada and Mexico, and the resilience of Eu- rope’s economy to the energy price shock from Russia’s war on Ukraine; a mild winter also helped reduce energy demand in Europe. In contrast, economic growth else- where in emerging Asia was weak in the first quarter mainly due to a pronounced tech-cycle slowdown. Oil prices edged down amid concerns about the global economic outlook. A slowing of retail energy inflation continued to contribute to an easing of headline con- sumer price inflation in many advanced foreign econo- mies (AFEs). Core inflation showed signs of easing in some foreign economies but remained persistently ele- vated amid tight labor markets. Accordingly, many for- eign central banks continued their monetary policy tightening. That said, some central banks paused their policy rate increases or altered their forward guidance amid uncertainty about the global economic outlook Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ and the recent banking-sector stress. Some also sig- naled a shift toward a more data-dependent approach in future decisions. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Market sentiment improved over the intermeeting pe- riod, with concerns about a sharp near-term decelera- tion in economic activity appearing to recede as stress in the banking sector declined. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2023 increased mod- estly over the period. Broad equity price indexes in- creased, although equity prices of some regional banks were lower, and equity market volatility declined. Fi- nancing conditions continued to be restrictive, and bor- rowing costs remained elevated. Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate in 2023 rose modestly, par- tially unwinding the sharp decline observed in early March due to the banking-sector stress. For 2024 and 2025, the implied policy path based on overnight index swaps fluctuated amid mixed economic data releases, and declined slightly on net. Yields on nominal Treas- ury securities with maturities greater than one year moved lower, and inflation compensation at medium- and long-term horizons edged down slightly. Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates declined modestly but remained substantially elevated by histor- ical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased moderately, and the VIX—the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—decreased notably over the intermeeting pe- riod. However, market participants remained attentive to developments at regional banks. Equity prices at such banks broadly declined over the intermeeting pe- riod in part because of higher funding costs, as well as concerns about profitability and a possible deterioration in the performance of commercial real estate (CRE) loans. Risk sentiment in foreign financial markets also im- proved, on net, over the intermeeting period amid re- duced investor concerns about the banking sector, lead- ing to moderate increases in broad equity indexes and declines in option-implied measures of equity volatility. That said, equity prices for euro-area banks declined somewhat, on net, and remained significantly lower than their levels before the onset of banking stresses in early March. Market expectations of policy rates and sovereign yields were little changed in most AFEs but rose notably in the U.K., in part because of higher-than- expected wage and inflation data. The dollar continued its earlier depreciation as differentials between U.S. and AFE sovereign yields narrowed and global risk senti- ment improved. Outflows from funds dedicated to emerging markets slowed to near zero over the inter- meeting period, while sovereign credit spreads for emerging market economies were little changed on net. U.S. markets for commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) stabilized over the inter- meeting period. Spreads for lower-rated nonfinancial CP, which spiked following Silicon Valley Bank’s clo- sure, narrowed significantly. Outstanding levels of CP and NCDs increased modestly over the intermeeting period, while the share of short-maturity unsecured is- suance of CP and NCDs fell to normal levels, reflecting a net easing of stress associated with regional banks. Conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained stable over the intermeet- ing period, and the increase of 25 basis points in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates following the March FOMC meeting fully passed through to over- night money market rates. The effective federal funds rate printed at 4.83 percent every day during the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate averaged 4.81 percent—slightly above the offering rate at the ON RRP facility. Daily take-up in the ON RRP facility remained elevated, reflecting continued significant us- age by money market mutual funds, ongoing uncer- tainty around the policy path, and limited supply of al- ternative investments such as Treasury bills. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses and households eased modestly in some markets but remained at elevated levels. Over the intermeeting period, yields on corporate bonds declined moderately, and yields on agency residential mortgage-backed secu- rities and 30-year conforming residential mortgage rates moved a little lower. However, interest rates on short- term small business loans continued to rise through March and reached their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. Credit flows for businesses and households slowed moderately, as high borrowing costs and market volatil- ity amid stress in the banking sector appeared to weigh on financing volumes in some markets. While issuance of nonfinancial corporate bonds and leveraged loans slowed notably in mid-March amid stress in the banking sector, issuance normalized over the intermeeting pe- riod as that stress abated later in the month and broader market sentiment rebounded. In April, speculative- grade nonfinancial bond issuance was solid, while in- vestment-grade nonfinancial bond issuance was sub- Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ dued, in part due to seasonal factors. Growth in com- mercial and industrial (C&I) loans on banks’ books was weak in the first quarter of 2023 relative to its pace in 2022. In the April SLOOS, banks reported further tightening of standards for most loan categories over the past three months, following widespread tightening in pre- vious quarters. Banks of all sizes expected their lending standards to tighten further for the rest of 2023. The most cited reason for tightening C&I standards and terms was a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook. Mid-sized banks—those that have total con- solidated assets in the range of $50 billion to $250 bil- lion—tightened C&I standards more than other banks and additionally reported that a deterioration in their current or expected liquidity position was an important reason for their tightening. Such banks account for a bit over one-fourth of C&I lending. Banks of all sizes expected to tighten C&I standards further over the re- mainder of the year, with small and mid-sized banks more widely reporting this expectation. Although CRE loan growth on banks’ balance sheets remained robust in the first quarter, the April SLOOS indicated that loan standards across all CRE loan cate- gories tightened further in the first quarter. The re- ported tightening in standards over the first quarter was particularly widespread for mid-sized banks. Banks also reported that they expected to tighten CRE standards further over the remainder of the year, with mid-sized banks very broadly reporting this expectation. Mean- while, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issuance was very slow in February and March, amid higher spreads and volatility as well as tighter lending standards. Credit remained broadly available in the residential mortgage market for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria, but credit avail- ability for households with lower credit scores remained tight. In the April SLOOS, the net percentages of banks reporting tighter standards for all consumer loan categories during the first quarter were elevated relative to their historical range, and respondents expected that standards would continue to tighten over the remainder of 2023. Even so, consumer loans grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, with a continued strong expansion in revolving credit balances. Overall, the credit quality of most businesses and households remained solid but deteriorated somewhat for businesses with lower credit ratings and for house- holds with lower credit scores. The credit quality of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets remained sound as of the end of the fourth quarter of last year. However, in the April SLOOS, banks frequently cited concerns about a deterioration in the quality of their loan portfolios as a reason for expecting to tighten standards over the remainder of the year. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system. The staff judged that the banking system was sound and resilient despite con- cerns about profitability at some banks. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained moder- ate. In particular, the staff noted that the equity risk premium and corporate bond spreads declined over the past few months but remained near historical medians. Valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained elevated. Rising borrowing costs had contributed to a moderation of price pressures in hous- ing markets, and year-over-year house price increases had decelerated. The staff noted that the CRE sector remained vulnerable to large price declines. This possi- bility seemed particularly salient for office and down- town retail properties given the shift toward telework in many industries. The staff also noted analysis that found that while losses to CRE debt holders could be moderate in aggregate, some banks and the CMBS mar- ket could experience stress should prices of these prop- erties decline significantly. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household leverage remained at moderate levels. For nonfinancial businesses, debt relative to nominal GDP declined some but continued to be near a historically high level. The ability of nonfinancial firms to service their debt kept pace with rising debt loads and interest rates. In terms of financial-sector leverage, going into the pe- riod of recent bank stress, banks of all sizes appeared strong, with substantial loss-absorbing capacity as measured by regulatory capital ratios well above levels that prevailed before the Great Recession. However, the ratio of tangible common equity to total tangible as- sets at banks—excluding global systemically important banks—had fallen sharply in recent quarters, partly be- cause of a substantial drop in the value of securities held in their portfolios. The majority of the banking system had been able to effectively manage this interest rate risk exposure. However, the failure of three banks re- sulting from poor interest rate risk and liquidity risk management had put stress on some additional banks. For the nonbank sector, leverage at large hedge funds remained somewhat elevated in the third quarter of Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ 2022, and more recent data from the Senior Credit Of- ficer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms sug- gested this fact had not changed. With regard to vulnerabilities associated with funding risks, the staff assessed that although funding strains had been notable for some banks, such strains remained low for the banking system as a whole, especially in light of official interventions by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the U.S. Department of Treasury to support bank depositors. Outflows of funds from bank deposits in mid-March, which were concentrated at a limited number of banks, had slowed. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the May FOMC meeting continued to assume that the ef- fects of the expected further tightening in bank credit conditions, amid already tight financial conditions, would lead to a mild recession starting later this year, followed by a moderately paced recovery. Real GDP was projected to decelerate over the next two quarters before declining modestly in both the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. Real GDP growth over 2024 and 2025 was projected to be below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth. The un- employment rate was forecast to increase this year, to peak next year, and then to start declining gradually in 2025. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to loosen, with the level of real output moving below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024 and the unemployment rate rising above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at that time. The staff’s core inflation forecast was revised up a little relative to the previous projection. Recent data for core PCE goods prices and the ECI measure of wage growth—the latter of which importantly influences the staff’s projection of core nonhousing services infla- tion—came in above expectations, and the staff judged that supply–demand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were easing a bit more slowly than anticipated. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 3.1 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.8 percent. Core goods inflation was projected to move down further this year and then remain subdued, housing services inflation was ex- pected to have about peaked in the first quarter and to move down over the rest of the year, and core nonhous- ing services inflation was forecast to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the pro- jected effects of less tightness in resource utilization, core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above 2 percent. With expected declines in consumer energy prices and a substantial moderation in food price inflation, total inflation was projected to run below core inflation this year and next. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be at about 2 percent. The staff continued to judge that uncertainty around the baseline projection was considerable and still viewed risks as being determined importantly by the im- plications for macroeconomic conditions of develop- ments in the banking sector. If banking-sector stress were to abate more quickly or have less of an effect on macroeconomic conditions than assumed in the base- line, then the risks would be tilted to the upside for eco- nomic activity and inflation, a scenario that the staff viewed as only a little less likely than the baseline. If banking and financial conditions and their effects on macroeconomic conditions were to deteriorate more than assumed in the baseline, then the risks around the baseline would be skewed to the downside for eco- nomic activity and inflation. On balance, the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside, as an upside economic scenario with higher inflation appeared more likely than a downside scenario with lower inflation, and because inflation could continue to be more persistent than expected and inflation expectations could become unanchored after a long period of elevated inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking sys- tem was sound and resilient. They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, participants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Against this back- ground, participants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that the growth rate of real GDP in the first quarter of this year was modest despite a pickup in consumer spending, as inventory investment—a volatile cate- gory—declined substantially. Participants generally ex- pected real GDP to grow at a pace below its longer-run Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ trend rate in 2023, reflecting the effects of restrictive financial conditions. Participants assessed that the cu- mulative tightening of monetary policy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive fi- nancial conditions. They also judged that banking-sec- tor stress would likely weigh further on economic activ- ity, but the extent to which that would be the case re- mained highly uncertain. With inflation well above the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, and core inflation showing only some signs of moderation, par- ticipants expected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market condi- tions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce infla- tionary pressures over time. Participants generally noted that the actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies in response to developments in the banking sector had been effective in largely reducing stress. They noted that conditions in the banking sector had broadly im- proved since early March, with the initial deposit out- flows experienced by some regional and smaller banks moderating substantially over subsequent weeks. Many participants commented that the recent developments in the banking sector had contributed to some tighten- ing of lending standards beyond that which had oc- curred during previous quarters, especially among small and mid-sized banks. Some participants noted that small businesses tend to rely on small and mid-sized banks as primary sources of credit and therefore may disproportionally bear the effects of tighter lending conditions. Some participants mentioned that access to credit had not yet appeared to have declined signifi- cantly since the recent onset of stress in the banking sector. Participants judged that stress in the banking sector would, in coming quarters, likely induce banks to tighten lending standards by more than they would have in response to higher interest rates alone. However, participants generally noted that it was too early to as- sess with confidence the magnitude and persistence of these effects on economic activity. In their discussion of the household sector, participants noted that consumer spending showed strength in the first quarter, supported by gains in personal disposable income. They also remarked that the quarterly strength was driven mainly by very strong spending growth in January, while real spending fell modestly over February and March. Consistent with that slowing, participants anticipated that consumer spending would likely grow at a subdued rate over the remainder of 2023, reflecting in large part the effects of the tightening in financial conditions over the past year. Participants remarked that higher interest rates would continue to restrain in- terest-sensitive expenditures by households, such as those on housing and durable goods. Participants also noted that the rise in uncertainty associated with recent developments in the banking sector could weigh on consumer sentiment and spending. However, several participants observed that high-frequency measures of consumer sentiment had not yet shown significant changes following the banking-sector developments. A few participants remarked that there had been some on- going reduction in consumers’ discretionary expendi- tures in the face of elevated inflation and higher bor- rowing rates, especially among lower- and middle-in- come households; some of those declines were report- edly driven by shifts in purchases toward lower-cost op- tions. Regarding the business sector, participants observed that growth in business fixed investment was subdued in the first quarter, reflecting relatively high borrowing costs, weak growth of business-sector output, and busi- nesses’ increasing concerns about the general economic outlook. Participants expected the tightening of bank lending standards to weigh further on firms’ capital ex- penditures. Several participants noted that, based on reports from their District contacts, concerns related to banking-sector stress could add more uncertainty to an already soft economic outlook, increasing firms’ cau- tion, especially at smaller and mid-sized firms that rely heavily on bank credit to finance their operations. However, some other participants mentioned that de- velopments in the banking sector appeared to have had only a modest effect so far on credit availability for firms. Participants noted that the labor market remained very tight, with robust payroll gains in March and an unem- ployment rate near historically low levels. Nevertheless, they noted some signs that the imbalance of supply and demand in the labor market was easing, with prime-age labor force participation returning to its pre-pandemic level and further reductions in the rates of job openings and quits. In addition, some participants noted that their District contacts reported less difficulty in hiring, lower turnover rates, and some layoffs. Participants an- ticipated that employment growth would likely slow further, reflecting a moderation in aggregate demand coming partly from tighter credit conditions. Partici- pants remarked that although nominal wage growth ap- peared to be slowing gradually, it was still running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was well above what would be consistent over Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the longer run with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants generally anticipated that under appropriate monetary policy, imbalances in the labor market would gradually diminish, easing pressures on wages and prices. Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high. They commented that data through March indi- cated that declines in inflation, particularly for measures of core inflation, had been slower than they had ex- pected. Participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it had decelerated less rapidly than expected in recent months, despite reports from several business contacts of supply chain constraints continuing to ease. Addi- tionally, participants emphasized that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months. Some participants remarked that a further easing in labor market conditions would be needed to help bring down inflation in this component. Regarding housing services inflation, participants ob- served that soft readings on rents for leases signed by new tenants were starting to feed into measured infla- tion. They expected that this process would continue and would help lead to a decline in housing services in- flation over this year. In discussing the likely effects on inflation of recent banking-sector developments, sev- eral participants remarked that tighter credit conditions may not put much downward pressure on inflation in part because lower credit availability could restrain ag- gregate supply as well as aggregate demand. Several participants noted that longer-term measures of infla- tion expectations from surveys of households and busi- nesses remained well anchored. Participants empha- sized that with appropriate firming of monetary policy, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 per- cent longer-run goal. Participants noted that risks associated with the recent banking stress had led them to raise their already high assessment of uncertainty around their economic out- looks. Participants judged that risks to the outlook for economic activity were weighted to the downside, al- though a few noted the risks were two sided. In dis- cussing sources of downside risk to economic activity, participants referenced the possibility that the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy could affect eco- nomic activity more than expected, and that further strains in the banking sector could prove more substan- tial than anticipated. Some participants also noted con- cerns that the statutory limit on federal debt might not be raised in a timely manner, threatening significant dis- ruptions to the financial system and tighter financial conditions that weaken the economy. Regarding risks to inflation, participants cited the possibility that price pressures could prove more persistent than anticipated because of, for example, stronger-than-expected con- sumer spending and a tight labor market, especially if the effect of bank stress on economic activity proved modest. However, a few participants cited the possibil- ity that further tightening of credit conditions could slow household spending and reduce business invest- ment and hiring, all of which would support the ongo- ing rebalancing of supply and demand in product and labor markets and reduce inflation pressures. In their discussion of financial stability, various partici- pants commented on recent developments in the bank- ing sector. These participants noted that the banking system was sound and resilient, that actions taken by the Federal Reserve in coordination with other govern- ment agencies had served to calm conditions in that sec- tor, but that stresses remained. A number of partici- pants noted that the banking sector was well capitalized overall, and that the most significant issues in the bank- ing system appeared to be limited to a small number of banks with poor risk-management practices or substan- tial exposure to specific vulnerabilities. These vulnera- bilities included significant unrealized losses on assets resulting from rising interest rates, heavy reliance on un- insured deposits, or strained profitability amid higher funding costs. Some participants additionally noted that, because of weak fundamentals for CRE such as high vacancy rates in the office segment, high exposure to such assets was a vulnerability for some banks. Par- ticipants also commented on the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions to runs or instability. These included money market funds, which had re- cently experienced large cash inflows; hedge funds, which tend to use substantial leverage and may hold concentrated positions in some assets with low or zero margin; thinly capitalized nonbank mortgage servicers; and digital asset entities. Many participants mentioned that it is essential that the debt limit be raised in a timely manner to avoid the risk of severely adverse disloca- tions in the financial system and the broader economy. A few participants noted the importance of orderly functioning of the market for U.S. Treasury securities or stressed the importance of the appropriate authori- ties continuing to address issues related to the resilience of the market. A number of participants emphasized that the Federal Reserve should maintain readiness to use its liquidity tools, as well as its microprudential and Minutes of the Meeting of May 2–3, 2023Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools, to mitigate future financial stability risks. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy actions at this meeting, participants concurred that in- flation remained substantially elevated relative to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quar- ter. The labor market continued to be tight, with robust job gains in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low. Participants also noted that recent de- velopments in the banking sector would likely result in tighter credit conditions for households and businesses, which would weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, the extent of these effects re- mained uncertain. Against this backdrop, all partici- pants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 per- cent to 5¼ percent. All participants agreed that it was also appropriate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, participants generally agreed that in light of the lagged effects of cumulative tightening in monetary policy and the potential effects on the economy of a further tightening in credit condi- tions, the extent to which additional increases in the tar- get range may be appropriate after this meeting had be- come less certain. Participants agreed that it would be important to closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for monetary policy. In deter- mining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, various participants noted specific factors that should bear on future decisions on policy actions. One such factor was the degree and timing with which cu- mulative policy tightening restrained economic activity and reduced inflation, with some participants com- menting that they saw evidence that the past years’ tightening was beginning to have its intended effect. Another factor was the degree to which tighter credit conditions for households and businesses resulting from events in the banking sector would weigh on ac- tivity and reduce inflation, which participants agreed was very uncertain. Additional factors included the progress toward returning inflation to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and the pace at which la- bor market conditions softened and economic growth slowed. Participants also discussed several risk-management considerations that could bear on future policy deci- sions. A few assessed that there were upside risks to economic growth. However, almost all participants commented that downside risks to growth and upside risks to unemployment had increased because of the possibility that banking-sector developments could lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Almost all participants stated that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer- run goal and the labor market remaining tight, upside risks to the inflation outlook remained a key factor shaping the policy outlook. A few participants noted that they also saw some downside risks to inflation. Taking into account these various considerations, par- ticipants discussed their views on the extent to which further policy firming after the current meeting may be appropriate. Participants generally expressed uncer- tainty about how much more policy tightening may be appropriate. Many participants focused on the need to retain optionality after this meeting. Some participants commented that, based on their expectations that pro- gress in returning inflation to 2 percent could continue to be unacceptably slow, additional policy firming would likely be warranted at future meetings. Several participants noted that if the economy evolved along the lines of their current outlooks, then further policy firming after this meeting may not be necessary. In light of the prominent risks to the Committee’s objec- tives with respect to both maximum employment and price stability, participants generally noted the im- portance of closely monitoring incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook. Participants discussed the importance and various as- pects of clearly explaining monetary policy actions and strategy. All participants reaffirmed their strong com- mitment to returning inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time and remained highly at- tentive to inflation risks. A few participants com- mented that recent monetary policy actions and com- munications had helped keep inflation expectations well anchored, which they saw as important for the attain- ment of the Committee’s goals. Participants empha- sized the importance of communicating to the public the data-dependent approach of policymakers, and the vast majority of participants commented that the ad- justed language in the postmeeting statement was help- ful in that respect. Some participants stressed that it was crucial to communicate that the language in the postmeeting statement should not be interpreted as sig- naling either that decreases in the target range are likely Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ this year or that further increases in the target range had been ruled out. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. They also con- curred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Infla- tion had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to in- flation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5 to 5¼ percent. Members agreed to closely monitor incoming information and as- sess the implications for monetary policy. In determin- ing the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and in- flation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that they will continue reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securi- ties, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to mon- itor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Com- mittee’s goals. Members also agreed that their assess- ments will take into account a wide range of infor- mation, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and fi- nancial and international developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 4, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 to 5¼ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.05 percent and with a per-coun- terparty limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of princi- pal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that cou- pon principal payments are less than the monthly cap. • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of agency debt and agency MBS re- ceived in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Economic activity expanded at a modest pace in the first quarter. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient.

Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets. Policy-sensitive rates increased over the intermeeting period, reflecting indications of contin- ued resilience in the economy, persistently elevated core inflation, and reduced downside tail risks following the resolution of the debt limit. The shift in policy expecta- tions contributed significantly to higher Treasury yields. The increase in nominal yields primarily reflected higher real rates rather than inflation compensation. Broad eq- uity prices rose, although the outperformance was con- centrated in a handful of companies with a large market capitalization. Cyclical sectors fared better than sectors that tend to appreciate in a downturn, suggesting some reduced investor concern about downside risks to growth. Investor sentiment about the banking sector improved as perceived tail risks regarding regional banks appeared to have receded. Equity prices for regional banks rose over the intermeeting period but were still well below early March levels. Financial conditions in- dexes were roughly unchanged, as higher rates and a stronger dollar were offset by higher equity prices and narrower credit spreads. The vast majority of respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Partici- pants expected no rate change at this meeting. While the median path from the surveys pointed to no rate changes through early 2024, there was significant dispersion across respondents, and respondents saw a clear proba- bility of additional tightening at coming meetings. Re- spondents’ average probability distribution for the level of the peak policy rate shifted higher since the May meet- ing and respondents on average assigned about 60 per- cent probability to the peak being above the current tar- get range. The market-implied path for the policy rate continued to show some decline this year but less so than it had in recent months. Measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from options remained very elevated, though they came down some over the intermeeting period. Desk survey respondents still saw a recession occurring in the near term as quite likely, but the expected timing was again pushed later, as economic data pointed to the continued resilience of economic activity. Overall, re- spondents generally continued to expect that any down- turn would be neither deep nor prolonged. With regard to inflation expectations, respondents marked up their projections for quarterly core personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE) inflation in the second and third quar- ters of this year, while projections for later quarters were little changed. The manager then turned to money market develop- ments and policy implementation. The median respond- ent to the Desk surveys expected the three-month bill yield to increase slightly relative to the similar-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rate and to remain above it into the fourth quarter. This expectation likely reflected a combination of rising net supply of bills as part of the Treasury Department’s plan to rebuild the Treasury General Account (TGA) following the resolution of the debt limit and expectations for healthy investor demand for bills. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility, which continued to support effective policy implementation and control over the federal funds rate, saw somewhat lower participation since the resolution of the debt limit, consistent with the historical experience that ON RRP participation is typically re- sponsive to changes in money market conditions. The median respondent to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers expected ON RRP participation to trend lower over the rest of this year. The staff assessed that the replenishment of the TGA and the ongoing balance sheet runoff, among other factors, were likely to subtract from reserves more than the decline in ON RRP partic- ipation would add to them. On net, the staff judged that reserves at the end of the year were likely to remain abundant. Uncertainty surrounding the outlooks for both reserves and ON RRP participation was substan- tial. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the June 13–14 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was expanding at a modest pace in the second quarter. Labor market conditions remained tight in re- cent months, as job gains were robust and the unem- ployment rate was low. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for PCE—continued to be elevated in April. Labor market conditions remained tight in April and May. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a robust pace during those two months. The unemploy- ment rate edged up, on net, but was still at a low level of 3.7 percent in May. On balance, the unemployment rate Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ for African Americans moved up to 5.6 percent, while the jobless rate for Hispanics moved down to 4.0 per- cent. In aggregate, the labor force participation rate held steady in April and May, and the employment-to- population ratio ticked down. The private-sector job openings rate in April—as measured by the Job Open- ings and Labor Turnover Survey—was unchanged from its relatively high first-quarter average, though it was lower than a year earlier. Recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be elevated, although lower than their highs last year. Over the 12 months ending in May, average hourly earn- ings for all employees increased 4.3 percent, below its peak of 5.9 percent early last year. Over the year ending in the first quarter, compensation per hour in the busi- ness sector increased 3.2 percent, down from 5.5 percent a year earlier. Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation had eased since the middle of last year, reflecting declines in consumer energy prices and soften- ing consumer food price inflation, but recent readings for core PCE price inflation—which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and most consumer food prices and usually provides a better signal about future inflation than the more volatile total inflation measure— were little changed. Total PCE price inflation was 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation was 4.7 percent—the same as the 12-month percent change recorded in January. In May, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 4.0 percent, and core CPI inflation was 5.3 per- cent—only slightly below its January reading. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price infla- tion constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.8 percent in April. Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations in May from the Uni- versity of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations remained within the range of their values reported in the decade before the pandemic; near-term measures of inflation expectations from these surveys moved down in May and continued to be below their peaks seen last year. Real GDP appeared to be increasing modestly in the sec- ond quarter following its stronger first-quarter gain. Pri- vate domestic final purchases (PDFP)—which includes PCE, residential investment, and business fixed invest- ment and often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than GDP—looked to be ex- panding more slowly in the second quarter than its ro- bust first-quarter pace. For the first half as a whole, PDFP growth seemed to be more resilient than in the second half of last year. The annual revisions to international trade statistics sug- gested that net exports contributed positively to U.S. real GDP growth in the first quarter, with real exports re- bounding more strongly than real imports following their fourth-quarter declines. In April, however, the nominal trade deficit widened notably, as nominal ex- ports decreased and nominal imports rose further. Foreign economic growth rebounded in the first quarter, reflecting in part the reopening of China’s economy from its COVID-19-related shutdowns and strong services-sector activity in other Asian countries, Canada, and Mexico. In the euro area, however, real GDP con- tracted modestly for a second consecutive quarter amid a pullback in consumer spending. Indicators pointed to a step-down in the pace of foreign economic growth in the second quarter, with the impetus from China’s reo- pening dissipating and global manufacturing activity re- maining weak. Global prices for energy and agricultural commodities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, while prices for metals fell further. Declines in retail en- ergy prices since the beginning of the year contributed to a notable easing in headline consumer price inflation in the foreign economies. By contrast, core inflation had yet to materially decline from its recent highs in many economies. In this context, and with tight labor market conditions, foreign central banks underscored the need to raise policy rates further or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring inflation back to their respec- tive targets and be well positioned in case inflation failed to decline as expected. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, market participants ap- peared to interpret incoming data as signaling, on bal- ance, more resilience in economic activity than previ- ously assumed and viewed communications from FOMC participants overall as pointing to a tighter path for policy than expected. As a result, Treasury yields and the expected future path for the federal funds rate shifted upward significantly. Meanwhile, broad equity prices also increased notably. Financing conditions re- mained moderately restrictive, but credit availability gen- erally remained solid. The expected path of the policy rate implied by market quotes moved up notably over the intermeeting period. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ A straight read of federal funds futures rates suggested that market participants expected that the federal funds rate would be roughly flat over the course of the rest of this year. The year-end expected rate was about 70 basis points higher than the year-end expectation before the May FOMC meeting. Beyond this year, the policy rate path implied by OIS quotes also moved up, to about 3.7 percent by the end of 2024. Similarly, nominal Treasury yields rose significantly. The rise in nominal yields mostly reflected an increase in real yields, as measures of inflation compensation were little changed, on net, amid somewhat mixed news on inflation. Measures of uncertainty about the path of interest rates remained very elevated by historical standards. The S&P 500 stock price index increased sizably, on net, over the intermeeting period, led by technology-related stocks. The VIX—the one-month option-implied vola- tility on the S&P 500 index—edged down, on balance, and ended the period near the 30th percentile of its his- torical distribution. Bank equity price indexes moved up notably, on net, over the intermeeting period. Stock prices for large banks were only somewhat below their levels before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), while those for regional banks remained below their lev- els in early March. Market-based policy rate expectations rose notably in most advanced foreign economies, as core inflation data surprised to the upside in some countries and central bank communications were perceived as pointing to more restrictive policy than expected. Notwithstanding the rise in global yields, foreign equity prices, credit spreads, and risk sentiment in foreign markets were little changed over the intermeeting period. The staff’s trade- weighted broad dollar index was also little changed, on net, but the exchange value of the dollar appreciated sig- nificantly against the Chinese renminbi amid increased investor concerns over China’s economic growth pro- spects. Conditions in overnight bank funding and repurchase agreement markets remained generally stable over the in- termeeting period. The 25 basis point increase in admin- istered rates at the May FOMC meeting fully passed through to overnight money market rates. Spreads and issuance volumes in unsecured short-term funding mar- kets stayed within their typical ranges. In May, yields of Treasury bills maturing in June and thus potentially af- fected by the federal debt limit rose sharply before largely retracing those increases after an agreement was reached to suspend the debt limit. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities increased notably over the intermeeting period. Interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and households in the first quarter rose further above their peaks from the previous tightening cycle, and yields on leveraged loans also rose, reaching levels close to their peak at the onset of the pandemic. Rates also moved up on a broad array of fixed-income securities, including investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds, municipal bonds, both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage- backed securities (CMBS), and agency residential mortgage-backed securities. The increases in yields on these instruments over the intermeeting period were generally in line with, or less than, the changes in their Treasury benchmarks. Small businesses and households saw continued increases in their borrowing costs. Rates on 30-year conforming residential mortgages stepped up, broadly in line with increases in comparable-duration Treasury yields. Interest rates on credit card offers con- tinued to rise through April, and auto loan interest rates moved sideways during the intermeeting period. Both credit card and auto loan interest rates stood at, or near, their highest levels since the Global Financial Crisis. Banks’ ability to fund loans to businesses and consumers appeared to have stabilized in recent weeks but remained somewhat strained relative to before the closure of SVB in March. Although banks continued to experience out- flows of core deposits, the pace of those outflows mod- erated substantially relative to March, suggesting some easing of bank funding pressures. Banks also continued to attract inflows of large time deposits, reflecting higher interest rates on new certificates of deposit. Total bank assets were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period. In capital markets, funding had generally been resilient. Issuance of nonfinancial investment-grade corporate bonds rose at a robust pace in May after slowing in April, partly due to the “earnings blackout” period. Specula- tive-grade issuance increased in late April and in May but remained subdued by historical standards. Gross issu- ance of municipal bonds was solid in April and May. Conditions in the leveraged loan and CMBS markets were somewhat more strained. Leveraged loan issuance remained subdued, reflecting weak investor demand amid concerns over the credit worthiness of borrowers. Both agency and non-agency CMBS issuance volumes were low in May relative to pre-pandemic levels. In ad- dition, for small businesses, credit availability continued to show signs of tightening. Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Credit remained easily available in the residential mort- gage market for high credit score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. For borrowers with lower scores, credit availability tightened slightly in April but remained close to pre-pandemic levels. In consumer credit markets, conditions stayed generally accommoda- tive, with credit available for most borrowers. The credit quality of most businesses and households re- mained solid, although market participants appeared to expect some deterioration in the coming quarters, which could weaken lender balance sheets and possibly weigh on credit availability. A measure of the May CMBS de- linquency rate showed about a 50 basis point increase, driven by a sharp rise in the delinquency rate for office buildings. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting continued to assume that the effects of the expected further tightening in bank credit condi- tions, amid already tight financial conditions, would lead to a mild recession starting later this year, followed by a moderately paced recovery. Real GDP was projected to decelerate in the current quarter and the next one before declining modestly in both the fourth quarter of this year and first quarter of next year. Real GDP growth over 2024 and 2025 was projected to be below the staff’s es- timate of potential output growth. The unemployment rate was forecast to increase this year, peak next year, and remain near that level through 2025. Current tight resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to ease, with the level of real output moving below the staff’s estimate of potential output in 2025 and the unemployment rate rising above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate at that time. The staff’s inflation forecast was little revised relative to the previous projection, and supply–demand imbalances in both goods markets and labor markets were still judged to be easing only slowly. On a four-quarter change basis, total PCE price inflation was projected to be 3.0 percent this year, with core inflation at 3.7 per- cent. Core goods inflation was forecast to move down further this year and then remain subdued. Housing ser- vices inflation was considered to have about peaked and was expected to move down over the rest of the year. Core nonhousing services inflation was projected to slow gradually as nominal wage growth eased further. Reflecting the effects of the easing in resource utilization over the projection, core inflation was forecast to slow through next year but remain moderately above 2 per- cent. With expected declines in consumer energy prices and further moderation in food price inflation, total in- flation was projected to run below core inflation this year and the next. In 2025, both total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent. The staff continued to judge that uncertainty around the baseline projection was considerable and still viewed the risks as being influenced importantly by the potential macroeconomic implications of banking-sector develop- ments, which could end up being more, or less, negative than assumed in the baseline. Given the continued strength in labor market conditions and the resilience of consumer spending, however, the staff saw the possibil- ity of the economy continuing to grow slowly and avoid- ing a downturn as almost as likely as the mild-recession baseline. On balance, the staff saw the risks around the baseline inflation forecast as tilted to the upside, as eco- nomic scenarios with higher inflation appeared more likely than scenarios with lower inflation and because in- flation could continue to be more persistent than ex- pected and inflation expectations could become unan- chored after a long period of elevated inflation. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2025 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace. Nonetheless, job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. How- ever, participants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Against this background, partici- pants concurred that they remained highly attentive to inflation risks. Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In assessing the economic outlook, most participants noted that real GDP growth had been resilient in recent quarters. Participants generally judged that growth would be subdued over the remainder of this year. They assessed that the cumulative tightening of monetary pol- icy over the past year had contributed significantly to more restrictive financial conditions and lower demand in the most interest rate sensitive sectors of the econ- omy, especially housing and business investment. Par- ticipants also acknowledged uncertainty about the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy and discussed the extent to which the full effects of mone- tary tightening on the economy had been realized. While total inflation had moderated over the past year, core in- flation had not shown a sustained easing since the begin- ning of the year. With inflation well above the Commit- tee’s longer-run 2 percent objective, participants ex- pected that a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market conditions would be needed to bring aggregate supply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflationary pressures suf- ficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants generally noted that banking stresses had re- ceded and conditions in the banking sector were much improved since early March. Participants generally con- tinued to judge that a tightening in credit conditions spurred by banking-sector stress earlier in the year would likely weigh further on economic activity, but the extent remained uncertain. Several participants mentioned that credit conditions had not appeared to have tightened sig- nificantly beyond what would be expected in response to the monetary policy actions taken since early last year. Some participants judged that it was still too early to as- sess with confidence the eventual effects of tighter bank credit conditions on economic activity and noted that it would be important to monitor closely the potential ef- fects of banking-sector developments on credit condi- tions and economic activity. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally noted that consumer spending so far this year had been stronger than expected. Several participants noted that aggregate household wealth remained high, as equity and home prices had not declined much from their recent highs. A few participants mentioned that while, overall, the household sector still retained much of the excess savings it had accumulated during the pan- demic, there were signs that consumers were facing in- creasingly tighter budget constraints, given high inflation and, especially for low-income households, depleted sav- ings. Regarding the business sector, various participants said that reports from their contacts were mixed, with some pointing to softening economic conditions and others indicating greater-than-expected strength. Many partic- ipants noted that developments in the banking sector ap- peared to have had only a modest effect so far on credit availability for firms. Some participants remarked that the effect of high interest rates on the housing sector ap- peared to be bottoming out, with home sales, builder sentiment, and new construction all having improved a little since the start of the year. In their discussion of economic activity, several partici- pants pointed out that recent GDP readings had been stronger than expected earlier in the year, while gross domestic income (GDI) readings had been weak. Of those who noted the discrepancy between GDP and GDI, most suggested that economic momentum may not be as strong as indicated by the GDP readings. In discussing that possibility, a couple of these participants also cited the recent subdued growth in aggregate hours worked. Participants noted that labor market conditions re- mained very tight, with robust payroll gains and the un- employment rate still near historically low levels. Nev- ertheless, they noted some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance, with the prime-age labor force participation rate moving up in recent months and further reductions in rates of job openings and quits, and declines in average weekly hours. A couple of participants conveyed that they heard at a recent Fed Listens event that, in various parts of the country, the lack of affordable housing in the area was preventing some lower-income workers from relo- cating to accept jobs. Similarly, a few participants noted that their District contacts reported less difficulty in hir- ing and retaining workers, lower turnover rates, and some layoffs. Some participants pointed out that payroll gains had remained robust but noted that some other measures of employment—such as those based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ household survey, the Quar- terly Census of Employment and Wages, or the Board staff’s measure of private employment using data from the payroll processing firm ADP—suggested that job growth may have been weaker than indicated by payroll employment. Participants anticipated that employment growth would likely slow further, consistent with their projections of below-trend economic growth. Partici- pants noted that nominal wage growth had shown signs of easing but observed that it was still running at a pace that, given current estimates of trend productivity growth, was above what would be consistent over the Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ longer run with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation ob- jective. Participants expected supply and demand con- ditions in the labor market to come into better balance over time, easing pressures on wages and prices. Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and noted that the data, including the CPI for May, indi- cated that declines in inflation had been slower than they had expected. Participants observed that although core goods inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it had slowed less rapidly than expected in recent months, despite data and reports from business contacts indicating that supply chain constraints had continued to ease. Some participants noted the recent moderation in housing services inflation and expected this trend to continue. However, a few participants pointed to upside risks to the outlook for housing services inflation asso- ciated with near-record low inventories of homes for sale, solid housing demand, and less-than-expected de- celeration recently in measures of rents for leases signed by new tenants. Additionally, some participants re- marked that core nonhousing services inflation had shown few signs of slowing in the past few months. Sev- eral participants noted that longer-term measures of in- flation expectations from surveys of households and businesses remained well anchored. Participants empha- sized that, with appropriate firming of monetary policy, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations would support a return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 per- cent longer-run goal over time. Participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy from both already-enacted monetary policy tightening and the potential additional tightening in credit conditions stem- ming from recent banking-sector developments. Partic- ipants noted that the full effects of monetary tightening had likely yet to be observed, though several highlighted the possibility that much of the effect of past monetary policy tightening may have already been realized. Re- garding downside risks to economic activity, participants noted the possibility that the cumulative and rapid tight- ening of monetary policy would eventually affect eco- nomic activity more than expected, and that the addi- tional effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated. Regard- ing risks to inflation, with inflation remaining well above the Committee’s longer-run goal, some participants mentioned the possibility that longer-term inflation ex- pectations could become unanchored, particularly in light of stronger-than-expected consumer demand and a still-tight labor market. Several participants cited the possibility of delayed effects of tighter credit conditions potentially contributing to a slowdown in economic ac- tivity that reduces inflationary pressures. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that while inflation had moderated since the middle of 2022, it re- mained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent. Economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace. The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unem- ployment rate still low, but there were some signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance. The economy was facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions, including higher interest rates, for households and businesses, which would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, al- though the extent of these effect remained uncertain. Against this backdrop, and in consideration of the sig- nificant cumulative tightening in the stance of monetary policy and the lags with which policy affects economic activity and inflation, almost all participants judged it ap- propriate or acceptable to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent at this meeting. Most of these participants observed that leaving the tar- get range unchanged at this meeting would allow them more time to assess the economy’s progress toward the Committee’s goals of maximum employment and price stability. Some participants indicated that they favored raising the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting or that they could have supported such a proposal. The participants favoring a 25 basis point increase noted that the labor market remained very tight, momentum in economic activity had been stronger than earlier anticipated, and there were few clear signs that inflation was on a path to return to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to continue the process of reduc- ing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as de- scribed in its previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, all participants contin- ued to anticipate that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and the labor market re- maining very tight, maintaining a restrictive stance for monetary policy would be appropriate to achieve the Committee’s objectives. Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate dur- ing 2023 would be appropriate. Most participants ob- served that uncertainty about the outlook for the econ- omy and inflation remained elevated and that additional Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ information would be valuable for considering the ap- propriate stance of monetary policy. Many also noted that, after rapidly tightening the stance of monetary pol- icy last year, the Committee had slowed the pace of tight- ening and that a further moderation in the pace of policy firming was appropriate in order to provide additional time to observe the effects of cumulative tightening and assess their implications for policy. Participants agreed that their policy decisions at every meeting would con- tinue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook as well as the balance of risks. They also emphasized the im- portance of communicating to the public their data- dependent approach. Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify their assessment regarding the stance of monetary policy that is likely to be appropriate to bring inflation down to 2 percent over time. Participants also discussed several risk-management considerations that could bear on future policy deci- sions. Almost all participants stated that, with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, upside risks to the inflation outlook or the possibility that persistently high inflation might cause inflation expectations to become unan- chored remained key factors shaping the policy outlook. Even though economic activity had been resilient re- cently and that the labor market remained strong, some participants commented that there continued to be downside risks to economic growth and upside risks to unemployment. Despite the receding of the stresses in the banking sector, some participants commented that it would be important to monitor whether developments in the banking sector lead to further tightening of credit conditions and weigh on economic activity. Some par- ticipants noted concerns about the potential risks stem- ming from weakness in commercial real estate. A number of participants observed that the resolution of the federal government debt limit had removed one source of significant uncertainty for the economic out- look. A few participants noted that there could be some upward pressure on money market rates in the near term as the Treasury issued more bills to meet expenditures and return the balance in the TGA to the Treasury’s pre- ferred level. Those participants observed that upward pressure on money market rates relative to the rate of- fered on the ON RRP facility could lead to a decline in usage of the facility. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had continued to expand at a modest pace. They also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had remained low. Inflation had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation, but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to in- flation risks. Members agreed that the Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the members agreed to maintain the target range for the fed- eral funds rate at 5 to 5¼ percent. Members agreed that holding the target range steady at this meeting allowed the Committee to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the ex- tent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members con- curred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which mon- etary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed that the Committee will continue to re- duce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the Minutes of the Meeting of June 13–14, 2023Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 15, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5 to 5¼ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.25 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.05 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon the principal payments are monthly cap. than less • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has continued to expand at a modest pace. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5 to 5¼ per- cent. Holding the target range steady at this meeting allows the Committee to assess addi- tional information and its implications for mon- etary policy. In determining the extent of addi- tional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems, Board Paul R. Wood, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Rebecca Zarutskie, Special Adviser to the Board, Division of Board Members, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Market participants interpreted data releases as generally demonstrating economic resilience and a further easing of inflation pressures. The market-implied peak for the federal funds rate rose in response to data pointing to a robust economy but retraced part of that move after the June consumer price index (CPI) release was interpreted by market participants as softer than anticipated. Even as market prices shifted to indicate a slightly more re- Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ strictive expected policy path, broader financial condi- tions eased a bit, reflecting in large part gains in equity prices and tighter credit spreads. Notably, share prices for bank equity also appreciated over the intermeeting period as concerns about the banking sector continued to dissipate. Spot and forward measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed over the intermeeting pe- riod at levels broadly consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term survey- and market-based measures continued to point to inflation expectations being firmly anchored. Market-implied peak policy rates in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) rose further this period, and the dollar depreci- ated modestly. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Pri- mary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants in July continued to place significant probability of a recession occurring by the end of 2024. However, the timing of a recession expected by survey respondents was again pushed later, and the probability of avoiding a recession through 2024 grew noticeably. Survey respondents an- ticipated that both headline and core personal consump- tion expenditures (PCE) inflation will decline to 2 per- cent by the end of 2025. There was a strong anticipation, evident in both market- based measures and responses to the Desk’s surveys, that the Committee would raise the target range 25 basis points at the July FOMC meeting. Most survey respond- ents had a modal expectation that a July rate hike would be the last of this tightening cycle, although most re- spondents also perceived that additional monetary pol- icy tightening after the July FOMC meeting was possible. As inferred from their responses, survey respondents ex- pected real rates to increase through the first half of 2024 and to remain above their expectations for the long-run neutral levels for a few years. The manager then turned to money market develop- ments and policy implementation. The overnight re- verse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility contin- ued to work as intended over the intermeeting period and had been instrumental in providing an effective floor under the federal funds rate and supporting other money market rates; those rates remained stable over the period. Following the suspension of the debt ceiling in early June, the Treasury Department issued securities, notably Treasury bills, to replenish the Treasury General Account (TGA). The resulting greater availability of Treasury bills, which were priced at rates slightly above the current and expected ON RRP rates, induced a net decline in ON RRP balances for the period. A further decline in ON RRP balances was deemed probable amid sustained projected Treasury bill issuance, further reduc- tions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in accordance with the previously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet, and a possible further reduction in policy uncer- tainty that could incentivize money funds to extend the duration of their portfolios. In the July Desk Survey of Primary Dealers, respondents expected lower ON RRP balances and higher bank reserves by the end of the year, compared with the June survey. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information available at the time of the July 25–26 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a moderate pace over the first half of the year. The labor market remained very tight, though the imbalance between demand and supply in the labor mar- ket was gradually diminishing. Consumer price infla- tion—as measured by the 12-month percent change in the price index for PCE—remained elevated in May, and available information suggested that inflation declined but remained elevated in June. In the second quarter, total nonfarm payroll employ- ment posted its slowest average monthly increase since the recovery began in mid-2020, though payroll gains re- mained robust compared with those seen before the pandemic. Similarly, the private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turn- over Survey, fell in May to its lowest level since March 2021 but remained well above pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate edged down to 3.6 percent in June, while the labor force participation rate and the employ- ment-to-population ratio were both unchanged. The unemployment rates for African Americans and Hispan- ics, however, both rose and were well above the national average. Average hourly earnings rose 4.4 percent over the 12 months ending in June, compared with a year- earlier increase of 5.4 percent. Consumer price inflation continued to show signs of easing but remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in en- ergy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.6 per- cent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023Page 3 of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.6 percent in May. In June, the 12-month change in the CPI was 3.0 per- cent, while core CPI inflation was 4.8 percent over the same period. Measures of short-term inflation expecta- tions had moved down alongside actual inflation but re- mained above pre-pandemic In contrast, measures of medium- to longer-term inflation expecta- tions were in the range seen in the decade before the pandemic. levels. Available indicators suggested that real GDP rose in the second quarter at a pace similar to the one posted in the first quarter. However, private domestic final pur- chases—which includes PCE, residential investment, and business fixed investment and which often provides a better signal of underlying economic momentum than does GDP—appeared to have decelerated in the second quarter. Manufacturing output rose in the second quar- ter, supported by a robust increase in motor vehicle pro- duction. After falling sharply in April, real exports of goods picked up in May, led by higher exports of industrial sup- plies and automotive products. Real goods imports fell, as lower imports of consumer goods and industrial sup- plies more than offset higher imports of capital goods. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed, as a sharp decline in nominal imports of goods and services outpaced a decline in exports. The available data sug- gested that net exports subtracted from U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter. Indicators of economic activity, such as purchasing man- agers indexes (PMIs), pointed to a step-down in the pace of foreign growth in the second quarter, reflecting fading of the impetus from China’s reopening, continued ane- mic growth in Europe, some weakening of activity in Canada and Mexico, as well as weak external demand and the slump in the high-tech industry weighing on many Asian economies. Incoming data also indicated that global manufacturing activity remained weak during the intermeeting period. Foreign headline inflation continued to fall, reflecting, in part, the pass-through of previous declines in commod- ity prices to retail energy and food prices. Core inflation edged down in many countries but generally remained high. In this context, and amid tight labor market con- ditions, many AFE central banks raised policy rates and underscored the need to raise rates further, or hold them at sufficiently restrictive levels, to bring inflation in their countries back to their targets. In contrast, central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold, and some indicated that a rate cut is possible at their next meeting. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, market participants inter- preted domestic economic data releases as indicating continued resilience of economic activity and some eas- ing of inflationary pressures, and they viewed monetary policy communications as pointing to somewhat more restrictive policy than expected. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate rose modestly, and nom- inal Treasury yields increased somewhat at shorter ma- turities. Meanwhile, broad equity prices increased, and spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed moderately. Financing conditions con- tinued to be generally restrictive, and borrowing costs remained elevated. Over the intermeeting period, the market-implied path for the federal funds rate rose modestly, while the timing of the path’s slightly higher peak moved a little later, to just after the November meeting. Beyond this year, the policy rate path implied by overnight index swap (OIS) quotes ended the period modestly higher. Yields on Treasury securities increased modestly at shorter matur- ities but only a bit at longer maturities. Measures of in- flation compensation rose only slightly for near-term and longer maturities. Measures of uncertainty about the path of the policy rate derived from interest rate op- tions remained very elevated by historical standards. Broad stock price indexes increased and spreads on in- vestment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds nar- rowed moderately over the intermeeting period. The VIX—the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500—edged down and ended the period near the 25th percentile of its historical distribution. Bank equity prices increased and outperformed the S&P 500 mod- estly. Stock prices for the largest banks fully recovered from their declines in the immediate wake of the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, while those for regional banks remained below the levels seen in early March. Short-term interest rates in the AFEs increased mod- estly, on net, over the intermeeting period as foreign cen- tral banks continued to raise policy rates and signal the potential for further tightening. Increases in yields were tempered, however, by downside surprises to both infla- tion and PMIs from some economies. Risk sentiment in foreign markets improved somewhat, with most foreign equity indexes increasing and foreign corporate and emerging market sovereign bond spreads narrowing. The staff’s trade-weighted broad dollar index declined moderately, with the largest moves following releases of Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ weaker-than-expected U.S. labor market data and lower- than-expected U.S. inflation data. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets re- mained generally stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads in unsecured markets narrowed modestly amid slight increases in OIS rates. Following the suspension of the debt limit, the Treasury Department partly replen- ished the TGA via a large net increase in bill issuance. Auctions of Treasury bills were met with robust demand, as shorter-term bill yields increased relative to other money market rates. Money market funds increased their holdings of Treasury bills and reduced their invest- ments with the ON RRP facility. ON RRP take-up de- clined notably—about $390 billion—over the intermeet- ing period, reflecting more attractive rates on some al- ternatives to investing in the ON RRP facility. Despite reduced ON RRP take-up, money funds maintained rel- atively high asset allocations in overnight repurchase agreement investments amid still-elevated uncertainty about the future path of policy. In domestic credit markets, borrowing costs for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained ele- vated by historical standards. Yields on agency commer- cial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed. The banking sector’s ability to fund loans to businesses and consumers was generally stable during the inter- meeting period. Core deposit volumes at both large and other domestic banks held steady at the levels that they reached in early May, after having declined sharply in March and April amid the banking-sector turmoil. Banks continued to attract inflows of large time depos- its, reflecting higher interest rates offered on new certif- icates of deposit. Meanwhile, wholesale borrowing— which primarily consists of advances from Federal Home Loan Banks, loans from the Bank Term Funding Program, and other credit extended by the Federal Re- serve—had fallen since May by domestic banks of all sizes, partially reversing the surge at the onset of the bank turmoil in March. Credit availability for businesses appeared to tighten somewhat in recent months. Credit from capital mar- kets was somewhat subdued but overall remained acces- sible for larger corporations. Issuance of leveraged loans remained limited, reflecting low levels of leveraged buy- out and merger and acquisition activity as well as weak investor demand. In the municipal bond market, gross issuance was solid in June, as both refundings and new capital issuance picked up from a somewhat subdued May. Commercial and industrial (C&I) loan balances contracted modestly in the second quarter, and commer- cial real estate (CRE) loan growth on banks’ books con- tinued to moderate. In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), banks reported having tightened standards and terms on C&I loans to firms of all sizes in the second quarter. The most cited reason for tightening C&I standards and terms continued to be concerns about the economic outlook. Banks also re- ported expecting to tighten C&I standards further over the remainder of the year. The July SLOOS also indicated that standards across all CRE loan categories tightened further in the second quarter and that banks expected to tighten CRE stand- ards further over the second half of the year. Meanwhile, CMBS issuance picked up a bit in May and then ticked down in June after recording low volumes earlier in the year. Credit in the residential mortgage market remained broadly available for high-credit-score borrowers who met standard conforming loan criteria. Only modest net percentages of banks in the July SLOOS reported tightening standards for mortgage loans eligible to be purchased by government-sponsored enterprises, while a moderate net percentage of banks reported expecting to tighten lending standards further for these loans over the second half of the year. Meanwhile, the availability of mortgage credit remained tighter for households with lower credit scores, at levels close to those prevailing be- fore the pandemic. Banks reported in the SLOOS that they had tightened standards for certain categories of residential real estate loans to be held on their balance sheets, such as jumbo loans and home equity lines of credit. In addition, banks reported expecting to tighten standards for jumbo loans during the remainder of 2023. Conditions remained generally accommodative in con- sumer credit markets, with credit available for most bor- rowers. Credit card balances increased in the second quarter, though at a somewhat slower pace than in pre- vious months. In the July SLOOS, banks reported ex- pecting to continue tightening lending standards for credit card loans. Overall, the credit quality of most businesses and house- holds remained solid. While there were signs of deteri- oration in credit quality in some sectors, such as the of- fice segment of CRE, delinquency rates generally re- mained near their pre-pandemic lows. The credit quality _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023Page 5 of C&I and CRE loans on banks’ balance sheets re- mained sound as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. However, in the July SLOOS, banks frequently cited concerns about the credit quality of both CRE and other loans as reasons for expecting to tighten their lending standards over the remainder of the year. Aggregate de- linquency rates on pools of commercial mortgages back- ing CMBS increased in May and June. The staff provided an update on its assessment of the stability of the financial system and, on balance, charac- terized the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as notable. The staff judged that asset valuation pressures remained notable. In particular, measures of valuations in both residential and commercial property markets remained high relative to fundamentals. House prices, while having cooled earlier this year, started to rise again, and price-to-rent ratios remained at elevated levels and near those seen in the mid-2000s. Although commercial property prices moved down, developments in the CRE sector following the pandemic may have pro- duced a permanent shift away from traditional working patterns. If so, fundamentals in the sector could decline notably and contribute to a deterioration in credit qual- ity. The staff assessed that vulnerabilities associated with household and nonfinancial business leverage remained moderate overall. Aggregate household debt growth re- mained in line with income growth. While nonfinancial businesses remained highly leveraged and thus vulnera- ble to shocks, firms’ debt growth has been relatively sub- dued recently, and their ability to service that debt has been quite high, even among lower-rated firms. Lever- age in the financial sector was characterized as notable. In the banking sector, regulatory risk-based capital ratios showed the system remained well capitalized. However, while the overall banking system retained ample loss- bearing capacity, some banks experienced sizable de- clines in the fair value of their assets as a consequence of rising interest rates. Vulnerabilities associated with funding risks were also characterized as notable. Al- though a small number of banks saw notable outflows of deposits late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter, deposit flows later stabilized. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the July FOMC meeting was stronger than the June projection. Since the emergence of stress in the banking sector in mid-March, indicators of spending and real activity had come in stronger than anticipated; as a result, the staff no longer judged that the economy would enter a mild recession toward the end of the year. However, the staff continued to expect that real GDP growth in 2024 and 2025 would run below their estimate of potential output growth, leading to a small increase in the unemployment rate relative to its current level. The staff continued to project that total and core PCE price inflation would move lower in coming years. Much of the step-down in core inflation was expected to occur over the second half of 2023, with forward-looking indi- cators pointing to a slowing in the rate of increase of housing services prices and with core nonhousing ser- vices prices and core goods prices expected to decelerate over the remainder of 2023. Inflation was anticipated to ease further over 2024 as demand–supply imbalances continued to resolve; by 2025, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 2.2 percent, and core inflation was expected to be 2.3 percent. The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were tilted to the downside. Risks to the staff’s baseline inflation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that infla- tion dynamics would prove to be more persistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply condi- tions might occur. Moreover, the additional monetary policy tightening that would be necessitated by higher or more persistent inflation represented a downside risk to the projection for real activity. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of current economic conditions, par- ticipants noted that economic activity had been expand- ing at a moderate pace. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate remained low. Inflation remained elevated. Participants agreed that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They commented that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on eco- nomic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, partici- pants agreed that the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Against this background, the Committee re- mained highly attentive to inflation risks. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted that real GDP growth had continued to exhibit resilience in the first half of the year and that the economy had been showing considerable momentum. A gradual slow- down in economic activity nevertheless appeared to be in progress, consistent with the restraint placed on de- mand by the cumulative tightening of monetary policy since early last year and the associated effects on finan- Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ cial conditions. Participants remarked on the uncer- tainty about the lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy and discussed the extent to which the ef- fects on the economy stemming from the tightening that the Committee had undertaken had already materialized. Participants commented that monetary policy tightening appeared to be working broadly as intended and that a continued gradual slowing in real GDP growth would help reduce demand–supply imbalances in the economy. Participants assessed that the ongoing tightening of credit conditions in the banking sector, as evidenced in the most recent surveys of banks, also would likely weigh on economic activity in coming quarters. Participants noted the recent reduction in total and core inflation rates. However, they stressed that inflation remained unacceptably high and that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path toward the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective. Participants continued to view a period of be- low-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in la- bor market conditions as needed to bring aggregate sup- ply and aggregate demand into better balance and reduce inflation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Participants noted that consumer spending had recently exhibited considerable resilience, underpinned by, in ag- gregate, strong household balance sheets, robust job and income gains, a low unemployment rate, and rising con- sumer confidence. Nevertheless, tight financial condi- tions, primarily reflecting the cumulative effect of the Committee’s shift to a restrictive policy stance, were ex- pected to contribute to slower growth in consumption in the period ahead. Participants cited other factors that were likely leading to, or appeared consistent with, a slowdown in consumption, including the declining stock of excess savings, softening labor market conditions, and increased price sensitivity on the part of customers. Some participants observed that recent increases in home prices suggested that the housing sector’s re- sponse to monetary policy restraint may have peaked. In their discussion of the business sector, participants cited various improvements in firms’ cost structures. These included better-functioning supply chains, lower input costs, and an increased ability to hire and retain workers. Participants also discussed conditions that could lead to higher economic activity—such as leaner inventories and reduced expectations of a sharp eco- nomic slowdown—and factors that could lead to lower economic activity—such as continuing economic uncer- tainty, the vulnerabilities of the CRE market, and the on- going weakness of manufacturing output. Participants judged that, over coming quarters, firms would reduce the pace of their investment spending and hiring in re- sponse to tight financial conditions and the slowing of economic activity. Participants remarked that the labor market continued to be very tight but pointed to signs that demand and supply were coming into better balance. They noted ev- idence that labor demand was easing—including de- clines in job openings, lower quits rates, more part-time work, slower growth in hours worked, higher unemploy- ment insurance claims, and more moderate rates of nominal wage growth. In addition, they remarked on indications of increasing labor supply, including a fur- ther rise in the prime-age participation rate to a post- pandemic high. Participants also observed, however, that although growth in payrolls had slowed recently, it continued to exceed values consistent over time with an unchanged unemployment rate, and that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels assessed to be con- sistent with the sustained achievement of the Commit- tee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants judged that further progress toward a balancing of demand and supply in the labor market was needed, and they ex- pected that additional softening in labor market condi- tions would take place over time. Participants cited a number of tentative signs that infla- tion pressures could be abating. These signs included some softening in core goods prices, lower online prices, evidence that firms were raising prices by smaller amounts than previously, slower increases in shelter prices, and recent declines in survey estimates of shorter- term inflation expectations and of inflation uncertainty. Various participants discussed the continued stability of longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with 2 percent inflation over time and the role that the Committee’s policy tightening had played in delivering this outcome. Nonetheless, several participants com- mented that significant disinflationary pressures had yet to become apparent in the prices of core services exclud- ing housing. Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent fa- vorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term objective and that el- evated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households—low-income families in particular. Partici- pants stressed that the Committee would need to see more data on inflation and further signs that aggregate demand and aggregate supply were moving into better balance to be confident that inflation pressures were _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023Page 7 abating and that inflation was on course to return to 2 percent over time. Participants generally noted a high degree of uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects on the economy of past monetary policy tightening. Participants cited upside risks to inflation, including those associated with scenar- ios in which recent supply chain improvements and fa- vorable commodity price trends did not continue or in which aggregate demand failed to slow by an amount sufficient to restore price stability over time, possibly leading to more persistent elevated inflation or an unan- choring of inflation expectations. In discussing down- side risks to economic activity and inflation, participants considered the possibility that the cumulative tightening of monetary policy could lead to a sharper slowdown in the economy than expected, as well as the possibility that the effects of the tightening of bank credit conditions could prove more substantial than anticipated. In their discussion of financial stability, participants ob- served that the banking system was sound and resilient and that banking stress had calmed in recent months. Participants also noted that the most recent stress-test results indicated that large banks appeared to be well po- sitioned to withstand a severe recession. Various partic- ipants commented on risks that could affect some banks, including unrealized losses on assets resulting from ris- ing interest rates, significant reliance on uninsured de- posits, and increased funding costs. Participants also commented on risks associated with a potential sharp decline in CRE valuations that could adversely affect some banks and other financial institutions, such as in- surance companies, that are heavily exposed to CRE. Several participants noted the susceptibility of some nonbank financial institutions, such as money market funds or digital asset entities, to runs or instability. In addition, several participants emphasized the need for banks to establish readiness to use Federal Reserve li- quidity facilities and for the Federal Reserve to ensure its own readiness to provide liquidity during periods of stress. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that eco- nomic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace. The labor market remained very tight, with robust job gains in recent months and the unemployment rate still low, but there were continuing signs that supply and de- mand in the labor market were coming into better bal- ance. Participants also noted that tighter credit condi- tions facing households and businesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation. However, the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Although in- flation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants remained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Amid these economic conditions, almost all participants judged it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5¼ to 5½ per- cent at this meeting. Participants noted that this action would put the stance of monetary policy further into re- strictive territory, consistent with reducing demand–sup- ply imbalances in the economy and helping to restore price stability. A couple of participants indicated that they favored leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged or that they could have supported such a proposal. They judged that maintaining the cur- rent degree of restrictiveness at this time would likely re- sult in further progress toward the Committee’s goals while allowing the Committee time to further evaluate this progress. All participants agreed that it was appro- priate to continue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, as described in its previ- ously announced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Fed- eral Reserve’s Balance Sheet. A number of participants noted that balance sheet runoff need not end when the Committee eventually begins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. They noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook remained elevated and agreed that policy decisions at future meet- ings should depend on the totality of the incoming in- formation and its implications for the economic outlook and inflation as well as for the balance of risks. Partici- pants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clarify the extent to which the disinflation process was continuing and product and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and sup- ply. This information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be ap- propriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Par- ticipants also emphasized the importance of communi- cating as clearly as possible about the Committee’s data- dependent approach to policy and its firm commitment to bring inflation down to its 2 percent objective. Participants discussed several risk-management consid- erations that could bear on future policy decisions. With inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see significant upside risks to inflation, which could require further tightening of monetary pol- icy. Some participants commented that even though economic activity had been resilient and the labor mar- ket had remained strong, there continued to be down- side risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate; these included the possibility that the macroeconomic effects of the tightening in financial conditions since the beginning of last year could prove more substantial than anticipated. A number of partici- pants judged that, with the stance of monetary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achievement of the Com- mittee’s goals had become more two sided, and it was important that the Committee’s decisions balance the risk of an inadvertent overtightening of policy against the cost of an insufficient tightening. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been ex- panding at a moderate pace. They also concurred that job gains had been robust in recent months, and the un- employment rate had remained low. Inflation had re- mained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. In support of the Committee’s objectives to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run, members agreed to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5¼ to 5½ per- cent. They also agreed that they would continue to as- sess additional information and its implications for mon- etary policy. In determining the extent of additional pol- icy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury se- curities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly com- mitted to returning inflation to their 2 percent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective July 27, 2023, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to: • Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent. • Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. • Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day. • Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon the principal payments are monthly cap. than less • Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month. • Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of July 25–26, 2023Page 9 • Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. In- flation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 5¼ to 5½ percent. The Committee will continue to assess addi- tional information and its implications for mon- etary policy. In determining the extent of addi- tional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumula- tive tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial devel- opments. In addition, the Committee will con- tinue reducing its holdings of Treasury securi- ties and agency debt and agency mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H.

McCarthy, Economic Research Advisor, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Ann E. Misback, Secretary, Office of the Secretary, Board Affairs, Board Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations The manager turned first to a review of developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. U.S. data releases generally pointed to greater economic resilience than previously thought, and the reaction in market pric- ing implied both a higher expected trajectory for the pol- icy rate at longer horizons and higher term premiums. Policy-sensitive rates rose moderately, and longer-dated forward rates displayed larger increases. Ten-year Treas- ury yields ended the period more than 40 basis points higher, and broad measures of equity prices fell. Bank equity prices underperformed over the period, but taking a somewhat longer view, investor sentiment toward the Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ banking sector appeared to have largely stabilized, with less differentiation of equity price movements across bank types. The dollar broadly appreciated against ad- vanced-economy currencies over the period, as stronger U.S. data supported moderately increased yield differen- tials against these economies amid perceptions that pol- icy rates were at or near their peaks. In China, signs of strain in the property sector increased, and optimism about growth diminished further, on net, although broader markets, including global commodity markets, did not appear to show elevated concern about China- related risks. U.S. financial conditions tightened, with higher longer-term rates, lower equity prices, and a stronger dollar contributing roughly equally to the in- crease in various financial conditions indexes. In addressing the increase in nominal yields on longer- run Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, the manager noted that the rise in real yields exceeded that of nominal yields over the period, implying a small de- cline in inflation compensation. Inflation expectations appeared to remain very well anchored. Market partici- pants cited various factors for the rise in longer-term nominal yields, including stronger-than-expected eco- nomic data, a possible increase in the neutral policy rate, greater economic and policy uncertainty, and larger- than-expected borrowing by the Treasury. Household and corporate borrowing rates increased over the period, generally rising in line with Treasury yields. Still, market participants noted that, with house- hold and corporate borrowers having a limited need to refinance debt in the near term, it could take more time for past monetary policy actions to fully pass through to these sectors. Regarding expectations for the September FOMC meet- ing, the manager noted that responses to the Open Mar- ket Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants and market pricing all pointed to a virtual certainty of no change in the policy rate. In addi- tion, modal expectations for the policy rate from the sur- veys were that the current target range would be main- tained until the May 2024 FOMC meeting, compared with March in the previous survey, with a roughly one- in-three chance of a 25 basis point increase by the No- vember FOMC meeting. For horizons beyond the mid- dle of next year, the modal path from the surveys was notably lower than the market-implied path. The manager turned next to developments in money markets and Desk operations. Usage of the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility contin- ued to decline over the intermeeting period, largely re- flecting reduced participation by government and prime money market funds even as these funds continued to see inflows. Increased supply of money market instru- ments, especially Treasury bills, contributed to a slight increase in money market rates, which appeared to in- duce money funds to shift away from ON RRP toward other instruments. However, the ON RRP facility con- tinued to provide an effective floor for the federal funds rate. With ON RRP balances falling more than Federal Reserve assets, reserve balances grew over the period. At more than $3.3 trillion, reserves remained abundant. In the September Survey of Primary Dealers, respond- ents generally saw a lower path for ON RRP participa- tion and a higher path for reserves, compared with the July survey. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The data available at the time of the September 19–20 meeting suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a solid pace in the third quarter. The labor market continued to be tight, with the unemploy- ment rate low and job gains slowing but remaining strong. Consumer price inflation was still elevated. The imbalance between labor demand and supply ap- peared to be easing. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a slower pace over July and August than in the second quarter. The private-sector job openings rate and the quits rate, both measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, moved down further through July. Over July and August, the unemployment rate edged up, on net, and stood at 3.8 percent in August, and both the labor force participation rate (LFPR) and the employment-to-population ratio rose slightly. The unemployment rate for African Americans declined, while the jobless rate for Hispanics rose, and both rates were still above the national average. The easing of labor market imbalances was also evident in the recent wage data, with the 12-month changes in average hourly earn- ings and the employment cost index, and the four-quar- ter change in business-sector compensation per hour all lower than their year-earlier levels. Consumer price inflation remained elevated but contin- ued to show signs of slowing. The total price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 3.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and core Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.2 percent over the same period; both total and core PCE price in- flation were lower than a year earlier. The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation con- structed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 4.1 percent in July, down from its level earlier in the year. In August, the 12-month change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 3.7 percent, while core CPI inflation was 4.3 percent over the same period, and both total and core CPI inflation were well below their year-earlier lev- els. Survey measures of consumers’ short-term inflation expectations had moved down alongside actual inflation but remained above pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, survey measures of medium- to longer-term inflation ex- pectations remained in the range seen in the decade be- fore the pandemic. Available indicators suggested that real GDP was ex- panding at a solid pace in the third quarter. Private do- mestic final purchases—which includes PCE, residential investment, and business fixed investment (BFI) and of- ten provides a better signal of underlying economic mo- mentum than does GDP—also looked to be rising sol- idly, led by gains in both PCE and BFI. After falling in the second quarter, real goods exports increased in July, supported by higher exports of auto- motive products. Real goods imports also rose, as im- ports of consumer goods and capital goods partially re- covered from their declines in recent months. The nom- inal U.S. international trade deficit widened, as growth in imports of goods and services outpaced that of exports. Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, as troubles in the property sector weighed on economic activity in China and monetary policy restraint contrib- uted to the slowing in economic growth in Europe. Available data for the third quarter, such as purchasing managers indexes and measures of business confidence, pointed to a continued subdued pace of economic activ- ity abroad. Foreign headline inflation continued to fall but remained elevated. In several economies, though, energy prices turned up again. In the context of still-high core infla- tion, some central banks in advanced foreign economies (AFEs) raised their policy rates, despite a slowdown in economic activity, and indicated their intention to hold these rates at sufficiently restrictive levels to bring infla- tion back to target rates. In contrast, central banks of emerging market economies largely remained on hold, and some even began to cut rates amid easing inflation- ary pressures. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Over the intermeeting period, generally robust eco- nomic data led to moderate increases in the market- implied path of the federal funds rate and yields on shorter-term Treasury securities. Yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury securities rose more substantially, mainly reflecting higher term premiums and higher real yields. Stock prices declined somewhat, but spreads on investment- and speculative-grade cor- porate bonds were little changed. Financing conditions tightened somewhat, and borrowing costs increased moderately. Market participants pointed to a range of factors that may have contributed to the increase in longer-term for- ward rates, including higher term premiums and upward revisions to market views of the likely path of Treasury debt over time. Real yields increased almost as much as or a little more than nominal yields, leaving implied measures of inflation compensation modestly changed. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate in the near term was up slightly since the July FOMC meeting, and the expected path further out, implied by overnight index swap contracts, rose moderately. Broad equity price indexes declined somewhat, and the one-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in- dex edged up slightly, on net, and stood near the 25th percentile of its historical distribution. Conditions in domestic short-term funding markets re- mained stable over the intermeeting period. Both prime and government money market funds experienced mod- erate inflows since the July FOMC meeting. Against a backdrop of heavy issuance of Treasury bills and the modest associated upward pressure on Treasury bill yields, take-up in the ON RRP facility continued to de- cline over the period and fell below $1.5 trillion late in the period. Over the intermeeting period, the dollar appreciated, as U.S. economic data came in stronger than expected, while foreign data suggested slowing economic growth abroad. Long-term yields in AFEs ended the period higher, reflecting spillovers from higher U.S. yields and, to a lesser extent, the increase in Japanese yields follow- ing the decision by the Bank of Japan to effectively widen its target range for the 10-year Japanese yield. Global equity prices declined moderately, reflecting higher long-term yields and increased concerns about the foreign economic outlook. Bond and equity funds focused on emerging markets saw moderate outflows. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ In domestic credit markets, borrowing rates for busi- nesses, households, and municipalities increased moder- ately over the intermeeting period, mostly reflecting a pass-through of higher yields on longer-maturity Treas- ury securities to those borrowing rates. Interest rates on newly originated bank loans to businesses and house- holds increased over the second quarter, interest rates on credit card offers increased in July, and interest rates on auto loans increased in July and August. Bank credit conditions appeared to tighten somewhat over the intermeeting period, but credit to businesses and households remained generally accessible. Com- mercial and industrial loan balances contracted, but out- standing commercial real estate (CRE) loans increased from July through late August, though at a slower pace than earlier in the year. Within the category of CRE loans, nonfarm nonresidential loans contracted over the summer for the first time since March 2022. Bank fund- ing conditions were generally stable. Core deposits de- clined but were offset by inflows of large time deposits. Credit was available for most consumers. Credit card balances grew in the second quarter through late August. For residential real estate borrowers, credit availability was little changed. Credit conditions for small busi- nesses were also fairly stable. The PayNet Small Busi- ness Lending Index indicated that loan originations edged up in July and stood above the median of its pre- pandemic level. Credit was generally accessible through capital markets, although issuance was subdued. Issu- ance of nonfinancial investment- and speculative-grade bonds was muted in July but picked up modestly in Au- gust, and issuance of municipal bonds was weak in July. New issuance of leveraged loans was subdued in July, and issuance of agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was soft in July and August. Credit quality deteriorated a little further across many sectors in recent months but remained broadly solid. In the CRE sector, delinquency rates on nonfarm nonresi- dential CRE bank loans rose over the second quarter, while delinquency rates on construction, land develop- ment, and multifamily loans were roughly unchanged. Delinquency rates of loans in CMBS pools increased, driven by the office and retail sectors. The office delin- quency rate rose more than 2 percentage points since January but remained below its pre-pandemic average. The delinquency rate for small business loans ticked up in June and July. Delinquency rates for credit cards and auto loans increased further in the second quarter and stood a bit above their average levels in the years leading up to the pandemic. The fraction of potential borrowers with a prime credit score expanded through the second quarter, moving further above its pre-pandemic level. The trailing default rates for investment- and specula- tive-grade corporate bonds increased in July but re- mained at historically low levels. The trailing default rate for leveraged loans was little changed, on net, but down- grades of leveraged loans surpassed upgrades in July and August. In contrast to many other types of loans, the payment performance of home mortgages improved. Delin- quency rates of Federal Housing Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs loans in July were lower than levels seen earlier this year, and delinquency rates of conventional loans remained at historical lows. Credit quality was also strong for municipal borrowers. Staff Economic Outlook The economic forecast prepared by the staff for the Sep- tember FOMC meeting was stronger than the July pro- jection, as consumer and business spending appeared to be more resilient to tight financial conditions than pre- viously expected. The staff assumed that GDP growth for the rest of this year would be damped a bit by the autoworkers’ strike, with these effects unwound by a small boost to GDP growth next year. The size and tim- ing of these effects were highly uncertain. In all, the staff projected that real GDP growth in 2024 through 2026 would be slower, on average, than this year and would run below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, restrained over the next couple of years by the lagged effects of monetary policy actions. The unem- ployment rate was projected to remain roughly flat through 2026, as upward pressure from below-potential output growth was offset by downward pressure from further improvements in labor market functioning. Total and core PCE price inflation were forecast to be around 3.5 percent at the end of this year, and inflation was projected to move lower in coming years, as demand and supply in product and labor markets continued to move into better alignment. Total and core PCE price inflation were expected to be close to 2 percent in 2026. The staff continued to view the uncertainty around the baseline projection as considerable. Risks around the in- flation forecast were seen as skewed to the upside, given the possibility that inflation could prove to be more per- sistent than expected or that further adverse shocks to supply conditions might occur. Should these upside in- flation risks materialize, the response of monetary policy could, if coupled with an adverse reaction in financial Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ markets, tilt the risks around the forecast for economic activity to the downside. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion for each year from 2023 through 2026 and over the longer run. The projections were based on their individ- ual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, includ- ing the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting. Regarding the economic outlook, participants assessed that real GDP had been expanding at a solid pace and had been more resilient than expected. Nevertheless, participants also noted that they expected that real GDP growth would slow in the near term. Participants judged that the current stance of monetary policy was restrictive and that it broadly appeared to be restraining the econ- omy as intended. Participants stressed that current in- flation remained unacceptably high while acknowledging that it had moderated somewhat over the past year. They also noted that further evidence would be required for them to be confident that inflation was clearly on a path to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Partici- pants continued to view a period of below-trend growth in real GDP and some softening in labor market condi- tions as likely to be needed to bring aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better balance and reduce in- flation pressures sufficiently to return inflation to 2 per- cent over time. In their discussion of the household sector, participants observed that aggregate consumer spending had contin- ued to exhibit considerable strength, supported by the strong labor market and by generally strong household balance sheets. However, many participants remarked that the finances of some households were coming un- der pressure amid high inflation and declining savings and that there had been an increasing reliance on credit to finance expenditures. In addition, tighter credit con- ditions, waning fiscal support for families, and a resump- tion of student loan payments were viewed by several participants as having the potential to weigh on the growth of consumption. While household credit quality was seen as generally strong, a few participants noted ris- ing delinquency rates on some types of consumer credit. A couple of participants also remarked that households were becoming increasingly price sensitive. Some par- ticipants noted that housing demand was resilient de- spite higher interest rates; new home construction was solid, in part reflecting the limited inventory of homes available for sale. Regarding the business sector, participants noted that activity continued to be solid, though several pointed to signs of softening conditions. Many participants noted improved business conditions from an increased ability to hire and retain workers, better-functioning supply chains, or reduced input cost pressures. A few partici- pants commented that their business contacts had re- ported difficulties passing on cost increases to custom- ers. Several participants judged that, over coming quar- ters, business activity would be restrained by tighter fi- nancial conditions, such as higher interest rates and more constrained access to bank credit. Several partici- pants noted, however, that the tightening of credit con- ditions resulting from the banking stresses earlier in the year was likely to be less severe than they previously ex- pected. A number of participants expressed concerns about vulnerabilities in the CRE sector. Many partici- pants commented that they expected that the autowork- ers’ strike would, in the near term, result in a slowdown in production of motor vehicles and parts and possibly put upward pressure on automobile prices, but that these effects would be temporary. With respect to the agricul- tural sector, a few participants noted that conditions were mixed, as crop prices had declined amid higher pro- duction estimates and as supply and demand imbalances pushed up the prices of some types of livestock and held down the prices of others. Participants observed that the labor market was tight but that supply and demand conditions were continuing to come into better balance. Most participants remarked that a range of indicators of labor demand were easing— as could be seen by declines in job openings, a narrowing of the jobs-to-workers gap, lower quits rates, and a re- duction in average weekly hours worked to levels at or below those seen before the pandemic. However, sev- eral participants noted that labor markets remained very tight in some sectors of the economy, such as health- care services and education. Many participants also ob- served that measures of labor supply, especially the LFPR, had moved up. Some participants commented that the increase in the LFPR for women had been par- ticularly notable, although they expressed concern that challenges regarding the availability of childcare could Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ affect the sustainability of this increase in participation. Several participants noted that immigration had also been boosting labor supply. Some participants observed that payroll growth remained strong but had slowed in recent months to a pace closer to that consistent with maintaining a constant unemployment rate over time. Most participants commented that the pace of nominal wage increases had moderated, and a few also mentioned that the wage premium for job switchers had come down. They noted, however, that nominal wages were still rising at rates above levels generally assessed to be consistent with the sustained achievement of the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective, given current esti- mates of trend productivity growth. Participants noted that the data received over the past several months generally suggested that inflation was slowing. Even with these favorable developments, they emphasized that further progress was needed to get in- flation sustainably to 2 percent. Participants pointed to the softening of price inflation for goods amid improv- ing supply conditions and to declining housing services inflation. Several participants remarked that, despite the recent rise in energy prices, food and energy prices over the past year had contributed to a decline in overall in- flation. However, participants also noted that significant progress in reducing inflation had yet to become appar- ent in the prices of core services excluding housing. Par- ticipants noted that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored and that shorter-term inflation expectations had been moving down from elevated lev- els. Participants observed that, notwithstanding recent favorable developments, inflation remained well above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective and that elevated inflation was continuing to harm businesses and households—particularly low-income households. Par- ticipants stressed that they would need to see more data indicating that inflation pressures were abating to be more confident that inflation was on course to return to 2 percent over time. Participants generally noted there was still a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. One new source of uncertainty was that associated with the autoworkers’ strike, and many participants observed that an intensification of the strike posed both an upside risk to inflation and a downside risk to activity. A majority of participants pointed to upside risks to inflation from rising energy prices that could undo some of the recent disinflation or to the risk that inflation would prove more persistent than expected. Various participants noted downside risks to economic activity, including that credit conditions might tighten more than expected if the domestic banking sector experienced further strains; the possibility that the economic slowdown in China could result in a drag on global economic growth; or that an extended U.S. government shutdown could have negative, albeit temporary, consequences for growth. Some participants remarked that an upside risk to their projections for economic activity was that the unexpected resilience that the economy had demon- strated so far could persist. Several participants com- mented that a government shutdown might result in the delayed release of some economic data and that this out- come would make it more difficult to assess economic conditions. A few participants observed that there were challenges in assessing the state of the economy because some data continued to be volatile and subject to large revisions. In their consideration of appropriate monetary policy ac- tions at this meeting, participants concurred that eco- nomic activity had been expanding at a solid pace and had been resilient. While the labor market remained tight, job gains had slowed, and there were continuing signs that supply and demand in the labor market were coming into better balance. Participants also noted that tighter credit conditions facing households and busi- nesses were a source of headwinds for the economy and would likely weigh on economic activity, hiring, and in- flation. However, the extent of these effects remained uncertain. Although inflation had moderated since the middle of last year, it remained well above the Commit- tee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent, and participants re- mained resolute in their commitment to bring inflation down to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Amid these economic conditions, and in consideration of the significant cumulative tightening in the stance of mone- tary policy and the lags with which policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, almost all participants judged it appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent at this meeting. Participants judged that maintaining this restrictive stance of policy would support further progress toward the Committee’s goals while allowing the Committee time to gather additional data to evaluate this progress. All participants agreed that it was appropriate to con- tinue the process of reducing the Federal Reserve’s se- curities holdings, as described in its previously an- nounced Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Re- serve’s Balance Sheet. In discussing the policy outlook, participants continued to judge that it was critical that the stance of monetary policy be kept sufficiently restrictive to return inflation Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ to the Committee’s 2 percent objective over time. A ma- jority of participants judged that one more increase in the target federal funds rate at a future meeting would likely be appropriate, while some judged it likely that no further increases would be warranted. All participants agreed that the Committee was in a position to proceed carefully and that policy decisions at every meeting would continue to be based on the totality of incoming information and its implications for the economic out- look as well as the balance of risks. Participants expected that the data arriving in coming months would help clar- ify the extent to which the disinflation process was con- tinuing and labor markets were reaching a better balance between demand and supply. This information would be valuable in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time. Some participants also emphasized the importance of continuing to communicate clearly to the public about the Committee’s data-dependent ap- proach to policy and its firm commitment to bring infla- tion down to 2 percent. All participants agreed that policy should remain restric- tive for some time until the Committee is confident that inflation is moving down sustainably toward its objec- tive. A few participants noted that the pace at which inflation was returning to the Committee’s 2 percent goal would influence their views of the sufficiently re- strictive level of the policy rate and how long to keep policy restrictive. Several participants commented that, with the policy rate likely at or near its peak, the focus of monetary policy decisions and communications should shift from how high to raise the policy rate to how long to hold the policy rate at restrictive levels. A few partic- ipants noted that it would be important to monitor the real federal funds rate in gauging the stance of monetary policy over time. Most participants observed that postmeeting communications, including the SEP, would help clarify to the public how participants assessed the likely evolution of the stance of monetary policy. Par- ticipants observed that the continuing process of reduc- ing the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was an important part of the overall approach to achieving their macroeconomic objectives. Several participants noted that the process of balance sheet runoff could continue for some time, even after the Committee be- gins to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate. A vast majority of participants continued to judge the future path of the economy as highly uncertain. Many noted data volatility and potential data revisions, or the difficulty of estimating the neutral policy rate, as sup- porting the case for proceeding carefully in determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be ap- propriate. Participants discussed several risk-management consid- erations that could bear on future policy decisions. Par- ticipants generally judged that, with the stance of mone- tary policy in restrictive territory, risks to the achieve- ment of the Committee’s goals had become more two sided. But with inflation still well above the Committee’s longer-run goal and the labor market remaining tight, most participants continued to see upside risks to infla- tion. These risks included the imbalance of aggregate demand and supply persisting longer than expected, as well as risks emanating from global oil markets, the po- tential for upside shocks to food prices, the effects of a strong housing market on shelter inflation, and the po- tential for more limited declines in goods prices. Many participants commented that even though economic ac- tivity had been resilient and the labor market had re- mained strong, there continued to be downside risks to economic activity and upside risks to the unemployment rate. Such risks included larger-than-anticipated lagged macroeconomic effects from the tightening in financial conditions, the effect of labor union strikes, slowing global growth, and continued weakness in the CRE sec- tor. Participants generally noted that it was important to balance the risk of overtightening against the risk of in- sufficient tightening. Committee Policy Actions In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that economic activity had been ex- panding at a solid pace, and, accordingly, that the corre- sponding language in the postmeeting statement should be changed from “moderate” to “solid.” They also con- curred that job gains had slowed in recent months but remained strong, and the unemployment rate had re- mained low. Inflation had remained elevated. Members concurred that the U.S. banking system was sound and resilient. They also agreed that tighter credit conditions for households and businesses were likely to weigh on economic activity, hiring, and inflation but that the extent of these effects was uncertain. Members also concurred that they remained highly attentive to infla- tion risks. In support of the Committee’s objectives to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 per- cent over the longer run, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. They also agreed that they would continue to assess additional information and its implications for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, members concurred that they would take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy af- fects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, members agreed to continue to reduce the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and mortgage- backed securities, as described in its previously an- nounced plans. All members affirmed that they are strongly committed to returning inflation to their 2 per- cent objective. Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. They would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. Mem- bers also agreed that their assessments will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international develop- ments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 21, 2023, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  Undertake open market operations as nec- essary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 5¼ to 5½ percent.  Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid rate of 5.5 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion.  Conduct standing overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations at an offering rate of 5.3 percent and with a per-counter- party limit of $160 billion per day.  Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $60 billion per month. Redeem Treasury coupon securities up to this monthly cap and Treasury bills to the extent that coupon principal payments are the monthly cap. than less  Reinvest into agency mortgage-backed se- curities (MBS) the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of $35 billion per month.  Allow modest deviations from stated amounts for reinvestments, if needed for operational reasons.  Engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settle- ment of the Federal Reserve’s agency MBS transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.: “Recent indicators suggest that economic activ- ity has been expanding at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed in recent months but remain strong, and the unemployment rate has re- mained low. Inflation remains elevated. The U.S. banking system is sound and resilient. Tighter credit conditions for households and businesses are likely to weigh on economic ac- tivity, hiring, and inflation. The extent of these effects remains uncertain. The Committee re- mains highly attentive to inflation risks. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum em- ployment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent. The Committee will continue to assess additional information and its implica- tions for monetary policy. In determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent over time, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects eco- nomic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments. In addition, the Com- mittee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in its previously announced plans. The Committee is Minutes of the Meeting of September 19–20, 2023Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The Committee’s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, in- cluding readings on labor market conditions, in- flation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michael S. Barr, Michelle W. Bowman, Lisa D. Cook, Austan D. Goolsbee, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Neel Kashkari, Adriana D. Kugler, Lorie K. Logan, and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to maintain the interest rate paid on reserve balances at 5.4 percent, effective Septem- ber 21, 2023. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve the es- tablishment of the primary credit rate at the existing level of 5.5 percent, effective September 21, 2023. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, October 31– The meeting adjourned at November 1, 2023. 10:10 a.m. on September 20, 2023. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on August 15, 2023, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 25–26, 2023. _______________________ Joshua Gallin Secretary Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________
