AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS (As amended effective January 30, 2018) OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS 1. The Federal Open Market Committee (the “Com- mittee”) authorizes and directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market trans- actions (the “Selected Bank”), to the extent necessary to carry out the most recent domestic policy directive adopted by the Committee: A. To buy or sell in the open market securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to prin- cipal and interest by, the United States, and securities that are direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, any agency of the United States, that are eligible for purchase or sale under Sec- tion 14(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (“Eligible Secu- rities”) for the System Open Market Account (“SOMA”): i. As an outright operation with securities dealers and foreign and international accounts maintained at the Selected Bank: on a same-day or deferred de- livery basis (including such transactions as are com- monly referred to as dollar rolls and coupon swaps) at market prices; or ii. As a temporary operation: on a same-day or deferred delivery basis, to purchase such Eligible Se- curities subject to an agreement to resell (“repo transactions”) or to sell such Eligible Securities sub- ject to an agreement to repurchase (“reverse repo transactions”) for a term of 65 business days or less, at rates that, unless otherwise authorized by the Committee, are determined by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the volume of agreements with individual counterparties; B. To allow Eligible Securities in the SOMA to ma- ture without replacement; C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection with a Treasury auction, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with the Treasury, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of the United States or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States; and D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an agency of the United States, in the case of Eligible Securities that are direct obligations of that agency or that are fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by that agency. SECURITIES LENDING 2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, the Committee authorizes the Se- lected Bank to operate a program to lend Eligible Secu- rities held in the SOMA to dealers on an overnight basis (except that the Selected Bank may lend Eligible Securi- ties for longer than an overnight term to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions). A. Such securities lending must be: i. At rates determined by competitive bidding; ii. At a minimum lending fee consistent with the objectives of the program; iii. Subject to reasonable limitations on the total amount of a specific issue of Eligible Securities that may be auctioned; and limitations on the iv. Subject to reasonable amount of Eligible Securities that each borrower may borrow. Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 3 B. The Selected Bank may: i. Reject bids that, as determined in its sole dis- cretion, could facilitate a bidder’s ability to control a single issue; ii. Accept Treasury securities or cash as collateral for any loan of securities authorized in this para- graph 2; and iii. Accept agency securities as collateral only for a loan of agency securities authorized in this para- graph 2. OPERATIONAL READINESS TESTING 3. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to undertake transactions of the type described in para- graphs 1 and 2 from time to time for the purpose of test- ing operational readiness, subject to the following limi- tations: A. All transactions authorized in this paragraph 3 shall be conducted with prior notice to the Commit- tee; B. The aggregate par value of the transactions au- thorized in this paragraph 3 that are of the type de- scribed in paragraph 1.A.i shall not exceed $5 billion per calendar year; and C. The outstanding amount of the transactions de- scribed in paragraphs 1.A.ii and 2 shall not exceed $5 billion at any given time. TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS 4. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments or other authorized services for foreign central bank and international accounts main- tained at a Federal Reserve Bank (the “Foreign Ac- counts”) and accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States pursuant to sec- tion 15 of the Federal Reserve Act (together with the Foreign Accounts, the “Customer Accounts”), the Com- mittee authorizes the following when undertaken on terms comparable to those available in the open market: A. The Selected Bank, for the SOMA, to undertake reverse repo transactions in Eligible Securities held in the SOMA with the Customer Accounts for a term of 65 business days or less; and B. Any Federal Reserve Bank that maintains Cus- tomer Accounts, for any such Customer Account, when appropriate and subject to all other necessary authorization and approvals, to: i. Undertake repo transactions in Eligible Securi- ties with dealers with a corresponding reverse repo transaction in such Eligible Securities with the Cus- tomer Accounts; and ii. Undertake intra-day repo transactions in Eligi- ble Securities with Foreign Accounts. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts un- der the provisions of this paragraph 4 may provide for a service fee when appropriate. Transactions undertaken with Customer Accounts are also subject to the authori- zation or approval of other entities, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, when involving accounts maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, the United States Department of the Treasury. ADDITIONAL MATTERS 5. The Committee authorizes the Chairman of the Committee, in fostering the Committee’s objectives dur- ing any period between meetings of the Committee, to instruct the Selected Bank to act on behalf of the Com- mittee to: A. Adjust somewhat in exceptional circumstances the stance of monetary policy and to take actions that may result in material changes in the composition and size of the assets in the SOMA; or B. Undertake transactions with respect to Eligible Securities in order to appropriately address temporary disruptions of an operational or highly unusual nature in U.S. dollar funding markets. Any such adjustment described in subparagraph A of this paragraph 5 shall be made in the context of the Committee’s discussion and decision about the stance of policy at its most recent meeting and the Committee’s long-run objectives to foster maximum employment and price stability, and shall be based on economic, financial, and monetary developments since the most recent meet- ing of the Committee. The Chairman, whenever feasi- ble, will consult with the Committee before making any instruction under this paragraph 5. The Committee voted unanimously to reaffirm without revision the Authorization for Foreign Currency Opera- tions and the Foreign Currency Directive as shown be- low.

The Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”) must direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the opera- tion if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time avail- able. ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee to direct the Selected Bank in advance to execute the operation if it would result in the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies, as defined in paragraph 3.C of this Au- thorization, totaling $5 billion or less since the close of the most recent regular meeting of the Commit- tee. B. Such an operation also shall be: i. Generally directed at countering disorderly market conditions; or ii. Undertaken to adjust System balances in light of probable future needs for currencies; or iii. Conducted for such other purposes as may be determined by the Committee. C. For purposes of this Authorization, the overall volume of standalone spot and forward transactions in foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregard- ing signs) of the dollar values of individual foreign cur- rencies purchased and sold, valued at the time of the transaction. WAREHOUSING 4. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank, with the prior approval of the Subcommittee and at the re- quest of the United States Treasury, to conduct swap transactions with the United States Exchange Stabiliza- tion Fund established by section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 under agreements in which the Selected Bank purchases foreign currencies from the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Exchange Stabilization Fund repurchases the foreign currencies from the Selected Bank at a later date (such purchases and sales also known as warehousing). RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS 5. The Committee authorizes the Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements established under the North American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements, and stand- Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 5 ing foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements as pro- vided in this Authorization and to the extent necessary to carry out any foreign currency directive of the Com- mittee.

These obligations include seeking to direct the member’s eco- nomic and financial policies toward the objective of fos- tering orderly economic growth with reasonable price stability. These obligations also include avoiding manip- ulating exchange rates or the international monetary sys- tem in such a way that would impede effective balance of payments adjustment or to give an unfair competitive advantage over other members. FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE (As reaffirmed effective January 30, 2018) 1. The Committee directs the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee (the “Selected Bank”) to ex- ecute open market transactions, for the System Open Market Account, in accordance with the provisions of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations (the “Authorization”) and subject to the limits in this Di- rective. 2. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to exe- cute warehousing transactions, if so requested by the United States Treasury and if approved by the Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the “Subcommittee”), subject to the limitation that the outstanding balance of United States dollars provided to the United States Treasury as a result of these transactions not at any time exceed $5 billion. 3. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to main- tain, for the System Open Market Account: A. Reciprocal currency arrangements with the fol- lowing foreign central banks: Foreign central bank Maximum amount (millions of dollars or equivalent) Bank of Canada Bank of Mexico 2,000 3,000 Standing dollar liquidity swap arrangements with B. the following foreign central banks: Bank of Canada Bank of England Bank of Japan European Central Bank Swiss National Bank C.

The Committee directs the Selected Bank to hold and to invest foreign currencies in the portfolio in ac- cordance with the provisions of paragraph 7 of the Au- thorization. 5. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to report to the Committee, at each regular meeting of the Com- mittee, on transactions undertaken pursuant to para- graphs 1 and 6 of the Authorization. The Selected Bank is also directed to provide quarterly reports to the Com- mittee regarding the management of the foreign cur- rency holdings pursuant to paragraph 7 of the Authori- zation. 6. The Committee directs the Selected Bank to con- duct testing of transactions for the purpose of opera- tional readiness in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 9 of the Authorization. By unanimous vote, the Committee revised its Program for Security of FOMC Information with a set of tech- nical changes to update references to other documents. In the Committee’s annual reconsideration of the State- ment on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strat- egy, participants agreed that only a minor revision was required at this meeting, which was to update the refer- ence to the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment from 4.8 percent to 4.6 percent. All participants supported the statement with the revision, and the Committee voted unanimously to approve the updated statement. STATEMENT ON LONGER-RUN GOALS AND MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY (As amended effective January 30, 2018) The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, sta- ble prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy deci- sions to the public as clearly as possible. Such clarity facilitates well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncer- tainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society. Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and finan- cial disturbances. Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore, the Committee’s policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its as- sessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily de- termined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expendi- tures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate. The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persis- tently above or below this objective. Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment in the face of signifi- cant economic disturbances. The maximum level of em- ployment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor mar- ket. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; ra- ther, the Committee’s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncer- tain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments. Information about Committee participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unem- ployment is published four times per year in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections. For ex- ample, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was 4.6 percent. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee’s as- sessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary. However, under circum- stances in which the Committee judges that the objec- tives are not complementary, it follows a balanced ap- proach in promoting them, taking into account the mag- nitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate. Page 8 _Federal Open Market Committee The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual or- ganizational meeting each January. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in do- mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet- ing period. Financial conditions eased further over re- cent weeks with market participants pointing to increas- ing appetites for risk and perceptions of diminished downside risks as factors buoying market sentiment. In this environment, yields on safe assets such as U.S. Treasury securities moved up some while corporate risk spreads narrowed and equity prices recorded further sig- nificant gains. Breakeven measures of inflation compen- sation derived from Treasury Inflation Protected Securi- ties (TIPS) moved up but remained low. Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations showed little change. Judging from interest rate futures, the ex- pected path of the federal funds rate shifted up over the period but continued to imply a gradual expected pace of policy firming. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of recent developments in money markets and FOMC operations. Year-end pressures were evi- dent in the market for foreign exchange basis swaps, but conditions returned to normal early in 2018. Yields on Treasury bills maturing in early March were elevated, re- flecting investors’ concerns about the possibility that a failure to raise the federal debt ceiling could affect the timing of principal payments for these securities. The Open Market Desk continued to execute reinvestment operations for Treasury and agency securities in the SOMA in accordance with the procedure specified in the Committee’s directive to the Desk. The deputy manager also reported on the volume of overnight reverse repur- chase agreement operations over the intermeeting pe- riod and discussed the Desk’s plans for small-value op- erational tests of various types of open market opera- tions over the coming year. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet- ing period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Inflation Analysis and Forecasting The staff presented three briefings on inflation analysis and forecasting. The presentations reviewed a number of commonly used structural and reduced-form models. These included structural models in which the rate of inflation is linked importantly to measures of resource slack and a measure of expected inflation relevant for wage and price setting—so-called Phillips curve specifi- cations—as well as statistical models in which inflation is primarily determined by a time-varying inflation trend or longer-run inflation expectations. The briefings noted several factors beyond those captured in the mod- els that appeared to have put downward pressure on prices in recent years. These included structural changes in price setting for some items, such as medical care, and the effects of idiosyncratic price shocks, such as the un- usual drop in prices of wireless telephone services in 2017. The staff found little compelling evidence for the possible influence of other factors such as a more com- petitive pricing environment or a change in the markup of prices over unit labor costs. Overall, for the set of models presented, the prediction errors in recent years were larger than those observed during the 2001–07 pe- riod but were consistent with historical norms and, in most models, did not appear to be biased. The staff presentations considered two key channels by which monetary policy influences inflation—the re- sponse of inflation to changes in resource utilization and the role of inflation expectations, or trend inflation, in the price-setting process. In part because inflation was importantly influenced by a number of short-lived fac- tors, the effects of current and expected resource utiliza- tion gaps on inflation were not easy to discern empiri- cally. Estimates of the strength of those effects had di- minished noticeably in recent years. The briefings high- lighted a number of other challenges associated with es- timating the strength and timing of the linkage between resource utilization and inflation, including the reliability of and changes over time in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output and the ability to adequately account for supply shocks. In addition, some research suggested that the relationship between re- source utilization and inflation may be nonlinear, with the response of inflation increasing as rates of utilization rise to very high levels. With regard to inflation expectations, two of the brief- ings presented findings that the longer-run trend in in- flation, absent cyclical disturbances or transitory fluctu- ations, had been stable in recent years at a little below 2 percent. The briefings reported that the average fore- casting performance of models employing either statisti- cal estimates of inflation trends or survey-based measures of inflation expectations as proxies for infla- tion expectations appeared comparable, even though different versions of such models could yield very differ- Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 9 ent forecasts at any given point in time. Moreover, al- though survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations tended to move in parallel with estimated inflation trends, the empirical research provided no clear guidance on how to construct a measure of inflation ex- pectations that would be the most useful for inflation forecasting. The staff noted that although reduced-form models in which inflation tends to revert toward longer- run inflation trends described the data reasonably well, those models offered little guidance to policymakers on how to conduct policy so as to achieve their desired out- come for inflation. Following the staff presentations, participants discussed how the inflation frameworks reviewed in the briefings informed their views on inflation and monetary policy. Almost all participants who commented agreed that a Phillips curve–type of inflation framework remained useful as one of their tools for understanding inflation dynamics and informing their decisions on monetary policy. Policymakers pointed to a number of possible reasons for the difficulty in estimating the link between resource utilization and inflation in recent years. These reasons included an extended period of low and stable inflation in the United States and other advanced econ- omies during which the effects of resource utilization on inflation became harder to identify, the shortcomings of commonly used measures of resource gaps, the effects of transitory changes in relative prices, and structural factors that had made business pricing more competitive or prices more flexible over time. It was noted that re- search focusing on inflation across U.S. states or metro- politan areas continued to find a significant relationship between price or wage inflation and measures of re- source gaps. A couple of participants questioned the usefulness of a Phillips curve–type framework for poli- cymaking, citing the limited ability of such frameworks to capture the relationship between economic activity and inflation. Participants generally agreed that inflation expectations played a fundamental role in understanding and forecast- ing inflation, with stable inflation expectations providing an important anchor for the rate of inflation over the longer run. Participants acknowledged that the causes of movements in short- and longer-run inflation expec- tations, including the role of monetary policy, were im- perfectly understood. They commented that various proxies for inflation expectations—readings from household and business surveys or from economic fore- casters, estimates derived from market prices, or esti- mated trends—were imperfect measures of actual infla- tion expectations, which are unobservable. That said, participants emphasized the critical need for the FOMC to maintain a credible longer-run inflation objective and to clearly communicate the Committee’s commitment to achieving that objective. Several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longer-run inflation expectations remained well an- chored; one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the Committee’s adoption of a numerical inflation target. However, a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting, in part, slippage in longer-run infla- tion expectations below the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective. In that regard, a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric. A couple of participants suggested that the Committee might consider expressing its objective as a range rather than a point estimate. A few other participants sug- gested that the FOMC could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the Committee would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations con- sistent with the Committee’s inflation objective, particu- larly in an environment in which the neutral rate of in- terest appeared likely to remain low. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the January 30–31 meet- ing indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through December and that real gross do- mestic product (GDP) expanded at about a 2½ percent pace in the fourth quarter of last year. Growth of real final domestic purchases by households and businesses, generally a good indicator of the economy’s underlying momentum, was solid. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained below 2 percent Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta- tions were little changed on balance. in December. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased solidly in December, and the national unemployment rate re- mained at 4.1 percent. The unemployment rates for His- panics, for Asians, and for African Americans were lower than earlier in the year and close to the levels seen just before the most recent recession. The national labor force participation rate held steady in December; relative to the declining trend suggested by an aging population, this sideways movement in the participation rate repre- sented a further strengthening in labor market condi- tions. The participation rate for prime-age (defined as Page 10 _Federal Open Market Committee ages 25 to 54) men edged up in December, while the rate for prime-age women declined slightly. The share of workers who were employed part time for economic rea- sons was little changed in December and was close to its pre-recession level. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits were little changed in November, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for un- employment insurance benefits continued to be at a low level in mid-January. Recent readings showed that gains in hourly labor compensation remained modest. Both the employment cost index for private-sector workers and average hourly earnings for all employees rose about 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in December. Total industrial production increased over the two months ending in December, with broad-based gains in manufacturing, mining, and utilities output. Automak- ers’ schedules indicated that assemblies of light motor vehicles would likely move up over the coming months. Broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional man- ufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term. Real PCE increased strongly in the fourth quarter. Re- cent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment, real disposa- ble personal income, and households’ net worth—con- tinued to be supportive of further solid growth of real PCE in the near term. Consumer sentiment in early Jan- uary, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat. Real residential investment rose briskly in the fourth quarter after having declined in the previous two quar- ters. Both starts and issuance of building permits for new single-family homes increased in the fourth quarter as a whole, and starts for multifamily units also moved up. Moreover, sales of both new and existing homes rose in the fourth quarter. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in- tellectual property increased at a solid pace in the fourth quarter. Recent indicators of business equipment spend- ing—such as rising new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat readings on busi- ness sentiment from national and regional surveys— pointed to further gains in equipment spending in the near term. Firms’ real spending for nonresidential struc- tures rose modestly in the fourth quarter, as an increase in outlays for drilling and mining structures was largely offset by a decline in expenditures for other business structures. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to edge up through late January. Total real government purchases rose modestly in the fourth quarter. Increased federal government purchases mostly reflected a rise in defense spending, and the gains in purchases by state and local governments were led by an increase in construction spending in this sector. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened fur- ther in November after widening sharply in October. Exports of goods and services picked up in November, while imports, particularly of consumer goods, increased robustly. Available data for goods trade in December suggested that import growth again outpaced export growth. All told, real net exports were estimated to be a substantial drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quar- ter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased about 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in December. Core PCE price infla- tion, which excludes changes in consumer food and en- ergy prices, was 1½ percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose around 2 percent over the same period, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ per- cent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Incoming data suggested that economic activity abroad continued to expand at a solid pace and that this expan- sion was broad based across countries. In the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP in the euro area and the United Kingdom expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter. In the emerging market economies (EMEs), Mexico’s economy rebounded after being held back by natural disasters in the third quarter. Economic growth remained solid in China but cooled off a bit in some emerging Asian economies after a very strong third-quarter performance. Inflation in both AFEs and EMEs picked up significantly in the fourth quarter, largely reflecting a boost from rising oil prices. Inflation excluding food and energy prices remained well below central bank targets in several economies, including the euro area and Japan. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Domestic financial market conditions eased considera- bly further over the intermeeting period. A strengthen- ing outlook for economic growth in the United States and abroad, along with recently enacted tax legislation, Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 11 appeared to boost investor sentiment. U.S. equity prices, Treasury yields, and market-based measures of inflation compensation rose, and spreads of yields on investment- and speculative-grade nonfinancial corporate bonds over those for comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed further. In addition, the dollar depreciated broadly amid strong foreign economic data and mone- tary policy communications by some foreign central banks that investors reportedly viewed as less accommo- dative than expected. FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally characterized by market participants as consistent with their expectations for continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation. The Com- mittee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at the December meeting was widely ex- pected, and the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the January meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, remained essentially zero. Over the inter- meeting period, the futures-implied probability of policy firming at the March meeting rose to about 85 percent; respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants assigned, on average, similarly high odds to a rate increase at the March meet- ing. Levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2018 and 2019 implied by overnight index swap rates moved up moderately. The nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up over the in- termeeting period amid an improved outlook for domes- tic and foreign economic growth. Yields on both 2- and 10-year Treasury securities moved up about 30 basis points. Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the November CPI release but subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the December CPI release. On net, inflation compensation moved up at both the 5-year and the 5-to-10-year horizons, and both measures returned to levels seen in early 2017 before the string of generally weaker-than-expected inflation readings. Broad equity price indexes rose substantially over the in- termeeting period, with investors pointing to a stronger global economic outlook and the supportive effect of the recently enacted tax legislation on risk sentiment. The VIX, an index of option-implied volatility for one- month returns on the S&P 500 index, increased but re- mained low by historical standards. Spreads of both in- vestment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields declined slightly and remained well below their historical aver- ages. The FOMC’s decision at its December meeting to raise the target range for the federal funds rate was transmit- ted smoothly to money market rates. The effective fed- eral funds rate held steady at a level near the middle of the target range except at year-end. While borrowing costs moved up briefly in offshore dollar funding mar- kets over year-end, conditions in money markets were reported to be orderly. In line with recent year-end ex- periences, rates and volumes in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets declined, while in secured markets, rates on Treasury repurchase agreements increased. Af- ter year-end, pressures in money markets abated quickly and rates and volumes returned to recent ranges. The broad nominal dollar index declined nearly 4 per- cent relative to its value at the time of the December FOMC meeting; the decline was most pronounced against AFE currencies, but the dollar depreciated nota- bly against most EME currencies as well. EME equity prices registered substantial gains, in part supported by a significant rise in commodity prices; emerging market bond spreads narrowed moderately, and flows into EME equity and bond funds strengthened substantially. Market-based measures of policy expectations and longer-term sovereign yields moved up in most AFEs. The Bank of Canada raised its policy rate at its January meeting, largely in response to better-than-expected eco- nomic data. The Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank (ECB) left their mone- tary policy stances unchanged, as expected. Nonethe- less, the ECB president’s optimistic assessment of the euro-area economy at the press conference following the January meeting was interpreted by market participants as a signal that monetary policy would be less accommo- dative than expected. Following those remarks, the euro appreciated notably against the dollar and core euro-area sovereign yields moved higher. That said, market-based measures of policy expectations continued to indicate that investors anticipate a gradual pace of monetary pol- icy normalization in the euro area. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period and continued to be supportive of economic activity. Respondents to the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Prac- tices (SLOOS) reported easing standards and narrowing Page 12 _Federal Open Market Committee loan spreads for large and middle-market firms and at- tributed this easing to more aggressive competition from other bank or nonbank lenders. Net debt financing by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations turned neg- ative in December, but the weakness appeared to reflect a softening in the demand for credit, possibly related to the anticipation of higher after-tax cash flows and repa- triation of foreign earnings. In contrast, gross issuance of speculative-grade bonds and institutional leveraged loans remained strong. Credit market conditions for small businesses remained relatively accommodative de- spite sluggish credit growth among these firms. Credit conditions in municipal bond markets also remained ac- commodative. In commercial real estate (CRE) markets, growth of loans held by banks slowed further in the fourth quarter, though CRE loans held by small banks and some types of CRE loans held by large banks—construction and land development loans in particular—expanded at a more robust pace. Financing conditions in the commer- cial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market re- mained accommodative as issuance continued at a ro- bust pace and spreads on CMBS remained near their lowest levels since the financial crisis. Credit conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommo- dative for most borrowers, though credit standards re- mained tight for borrowers with low credit scores or hard-to-document incomes. Mortgage rates increased in tandem with rates on longer-term Treasury securities but remained quite low by historical standards. Conditions in consumer credit markets remained largely supportive of economic activity. Consumer credit in- creased notably in November, exceeding the more mod- erate volume of borrowing observed earlier in the year. Revolving credit expanded in November, while nonre- volving credit grew robustly, mainly driven by expansion in student and other consumer loans. In contrast, growth of auto lending slowed in recent months, con- sistent with the weakening demand for such loans in the fourth quarter as reported in the January SLOOS. For subprime borrowers, conditions remained tight, particu- larly in the market for credit cards and auto loans. The staff provided its latest report on the potential risks to financial stability; the report continued to characterize the financial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. This overall assessment incor- porated the staff’s judgment that vulnerabilities associ- ated with asset valuation pressures continued to be ele- vated; asset valuation pressures apparently reflected, in part, a broad-based appetite for risk among investors. The staff judged that vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial sector appeared to remain moderate, while vulnerabilities stemming from financial-sector leverage and from maturity and liquidity transformation contin- ued to be viewed as low. Staff Economic Outlook The U.S. economic projection prepared by the staff for the January FOMC meeting was stronger than the staff forecast at the time of the December meeting. Real GDP was estimated to have risen in the fourth quarter of last year by somewhat more than the staff had previ- ously expected, as gains in both household and business spending were larger than anticipated. Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was revised up, reflecting a reassessment of the recently enacted tax cuts, along with higher projected paths for equity prices and foreign economic growth and a lower assumed path for the for- eign exchange value of the dollar. Real GDP was pro- jected to increase at a somewhat faster pace than poten- tial output through 2020; the staff continued to assume that the recently enacted tax cuts would boost real GDP growth moderately over the medium term. The unem- ployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run well below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this pe- riod. Estimates of total and core PCE price inflation for 2017 were in line with the staff’s previous forecast. The pro- jection for inflation over the medium term was revised up slightly, primarily reflecting tighter resource utiliza- tion in the January forecast. Total PCE price inflation in 2018 was projected to be somewhat faster than in 2017 despite a slower projected pace of increases in con- sumer energy prices; core PCE prices were forecast to rise notably faster in 2018, importantly reflecting both the expected waning of transitory factors that held down 12-month measures of inflation in 2017 as well as the projected further tightening in resource utilization. The staff projected that core inflation would reach 2 percent in 2019 and that total inflation would be at the Commit- tee’s 2 percent objective in 2020. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. On the one hand, many indicators of uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook remained subdued; on the other hand, considerable uncertainty remained about a number of federal government policies relevant for the economic outlook. The staff saw the risks to the fore- casts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 13 as balanced. The risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as balanced. Downside risks included the pos- sibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of soft core inflation readings this year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that infla- tion could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in December indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that economic activity expanded at a solid rate. Gains in em- ployment, household spending, and business fixed in- vestment were solid, and the unemployment rate stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of in- flation compensation increased in recent months but re- mained low; survey-based measures of longer-term in- flation expectations were little changed, on balance. Participants generally saw incoming information on eco- nomic activity and the labor market as consistent with continued above-trend economic growth and a further strengthening in labor market conditions, with the recent solid gains in household and business spending indicat- ing substantial underlying economic momentum. They pointed to accommodative financial conditions, the re- cently enacted tax legislation, and an improved global economic outlook as factors likely to support economic growth over coming quarters. Participants expected that with further gradual adjustments in the stance of mone- tary policy, economic activity would expand at a moder- ate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong. Near-term risks to the economic outlook ap- peared roughly balanced. Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. However, participants judged that it was important to continue to monitor inflation develop- ments closely. Participants expected the recent solid growth in con- sumer spending to continue, supported by further gains in employment and income, increased household wealth resulting from higher asset prices, and high levels of con- sumer confidence. It was noted that spending on dura- ble goods to replace those damaged during the hurri- canes in September may have provided a temporary boost to consumer spending. In connection with solid growth in consumer spending, a couple of participants noted that the household saving rate had declined to its lowest level since 2005, likely driven by buoyant con- sumer sentiment or expectations that the rise in house- hold wealth would be sustained. Participants characterized their business contacts as gen- erally upbeat about the economy; their contacts cited the recent tax cuts and notable improvements in the global economic outlook as positive factors. Manufacturers in a number of Districts had responded to increased orders by boosting production. Against a backdrop of higher energy prices and increased global demand for crude oil, a couple of participants revised up their forecasts for en- ergy production in their respective Districts. Businesses in a number of Districts reported plans to further in- crease investment in coming quarters in order to expand capacity. Even so, several participants expressed con- siderable uncertainty about the degree to which changes to corporate taxes would support business investment and capacity expansion; according to these participants, firms may be only just beginning to determine how they might allocate their tax savings among investment, worker compensation, mergers and acquisitions, returns to shareholders, or other uses. The labor market had strengthened further in recent months, as indicated by continued solid payroll gains, a small increase in average hours worked, and a labor force participation rate that had held steady despite the longer- run declining trend implied by an aging population. Many participants reported that labor market conditions were tight in their Districts, evidenced by low unemploy- ment rates, difficulties for employers in filling open po- sitions or retaining workers, or some signs of upward pressure on wages. The unemployment rate, at 4.1 per- cent, had remained near the lowest level seen in the past 20 years. It was noted that other labor market indica- tors—such as the U-6 measure of unemployment or the share of involuntary part-time employment—had re- turned to their pre-recession levels. A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full em- ployment, some margins of slack remained; these partic- ipants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth. Page 14 _Federal Open Market Committee During their discussion of labor market conditions, par- ticipants expressed a range of views about recent wage developments. While some participants heard more re- ports of wage pressures from their business contacts over the intermeeting period, participants generally noted few signs of a broad-based pickup in wage growth in available data. With regard to how firms might use part of their tax savings to boost compensation, a few participants suggested that such a boost could be in the form of onetime bonuses or variable pay rather than a permanent increase in wage structures. It was noted that the pace of wage gains might not increase appreciably if productivity growth remains low. That said, a number of participants judged that the continued tightening in labor markets was likely to translate into faster wage in- creases at some point. In their discussion of inflation developments, many par- ticipants noted that inflation data in recent months had generally pointed to a gradual rise in inflation, as the 12-month core PCE price inflation rose to 1.5 percent in December, up 0.2 percentage point from the low rec- orded in the summer. Meanwhile, total PCE price infla- tion was 1.7 percent over the same 12-month period. Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term. Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs. That said, a few participants posited that the recently enacted corporate tax cuts might lead firms to cut prices in order to remain competitive or to gain mar- ket share, which could result in a transitory drag on in- flation. With regard to inflation expectations, available readings from surveys had been steady and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up, although they remained low. Many participants thought that inflation expectations remained well anchored and would support the gradual return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective over the medium term. However, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation con- sistently running below the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped be- low levels consistent with that objective. Many participants noted that financial conditions had eased significantly over the intermeeting period; these participants generally viewed the economic effects of the decline in the dollar and the rise in equity prices as more than offsetting the effects of the increase in nominal Treasury yields. One participant reported that financial market contacts did not see the relatively flat slope of the yield curve as signaling an increased risk of recession. A few others judged that it would be important to continue to monitor the effects of policy firming on the slope of the yield curve, noting the strong association between past yield curve inversions and recessions. Regulatory actions and improved risk management in re- cent years had put the financial system in a better posi- tion to withstand adverse shocks, such as a substantial decline in asset prices, than in the past. However, amid elevated asset valuations and an increased use of debt by nonfinancial corporations, several participants cautioned that imbalances in financial markets may begin to emerge as the economy continued to operate above po- tential. In this environment, increased use of leverage by nonbank financial institutions might be difficult to detect in a timely manner. It was also noted that the Committee should regularly reassess risks to the finan- cial system and their implications for the economic out- look in light of the potential for changes in regulatory policies over time. In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan- cial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and inflation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. Partici- pants agreed that a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate and reaffirmed that adjustments to the policy path would depend on their assessments of how the economic out- look and risks to the outlook were evolving relative to the Committee’s policy objectives. While participants continued to expect economic activity to expand at a moderate pace over the medium term, they anticipated that the rate of economic growth in 2018 would exceed their estimates of its sustainable longer-run pace and that labor market conditions would strengthen further. A number of participants indicated that they had marked up their forecasts for economic growth in the near term relative to those made for the December meeting in light of the strength of recent data on economic activity in the United States and abroad, continued accommodative fi- nancial conditions, and information suggesting that the effects of recently enacted tax changes—while still un- certain—might be somewhat larger in the near term than previously thought. Several others suggested that the Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 15 upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic ac- tivity may have increased. A majority of participants noted that a stronger outlook for economic growth raised the likelihood that further gradual policy firming would be appropriate. Almost all participants continued to anticipate that infla- tion would move up to the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term as economic growth re- mained above trend and the labor market stayed strong; several commented that recent developments had in- creased their confidence in the outlook for further pro- gress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objec- tive. A couple noted that a step-up in the pace of eco- nomic growth could tighten labor market conditions even more than they currently anticipated, posing risks to inflation and financial stability associated with sub- stantially overshooting full employment. However, some participants saw an appreciable risk that inflation would continue to fall short of the Committee’s objec- tive. These participants saw little solid evidence that the strength of economic activity and the labor market was showing through to significant wage or inflation pres- sures. They judged that the Committee could afford to be patient in deciding whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in order to support fur- ther strengthening of the labor market and allow partic- ipants to assess whether incoming information on infla- tion showed that it was solidly on a track toward the Committee’s objective. Some participants also commented on the likely evolu- tion of the neutral federal funds rate. By most estimates, the neutral level of the federal funds rate had been very low in recent years, but it was expected to rise slowly over time toward its longer-run level. However, the out- look for the neutral rate was uncertain and would de- pend on the interplay of a number of forces. For exam- ple, the neutral rate, which appeared to have fallen sharply during the Global Financial Crisis when financial headwinds had restrained demand, might move up more than anticipated as the global economy strengthened. Alternatively, the longer-run level of the neutral rate might remain low in the absence of fundamental shifts in trends in productivity, demographics, or the demand for safe assets. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in December indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employ- ment, household spending, and business fixed invest- ment had been solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in re- cent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Members expected that, with further gradual adjust- ments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activ- ity would expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions would remain strong. In their discussion of the economic outlook, most members viewed the recent data bearing on real economic activity as suggesting a modestly stronger near-term outlook than they had an- ticipated at their meeting in December. In addition, fi- nancial conditions had remained accommodative, and the details of the tax legislation suggested that its effects on consumer and business spending—while still uncer- tain—might be a bit greater in the near term than they had previously thought. Although several saw increased upside risks to the near-term outlook for economic ac- tivity, members generally continued to judge the risks to that outlook as remaining roughly balanced. Most members noted that recent information on infla- tion along with prospects for a continued solid pace of economic activity provided support for the view that in- flation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in 2018 and stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. However, a couple of members expressed concern about the outlook for infla- tion, seeing little evidence of a meaningful improvement in the underlying trend in inflation, measures of inflation expectations, or wage growth. Several members com- mented that they saw both upside and downside risks to the inflation outlook, and members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers voted to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¼ to 1½ percent. They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s Page 16 _Federal Open Market Committee objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in- flation. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla- tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members also agreed to carefully monitor actual and expected in- flation developments relative to the Committee’s sym- metric inflation goal. Members expected that economic conditions would evolve in a manner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. They judged that a gradual approach to raising the target range would sustain the economic expansion and balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment. Members agreed that the strengthening in the near-term economic outlook increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap- propriate. They therefore agreed to update the charac- terization of their expectation for the evolution of the federal funds rate in the postmeeting statement to point to “further gradual increases” while maintaining the tar- get range at the current meeting. Members continued to anticipate that the federal funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run. Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe- cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective February 1, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1¼ to 1½ percent, including overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.25 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $12 billion, and to re- invest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $8 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed invest- ment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run be- low 2 percent. Market-based measures of infla- tion compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will ex- pand at a moderate pace and labor market con- ditions will remain strong. Inflation on a month basis is expected to move up this year 12 and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective over the medium term. Near- term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is moni- toring inflation developments closely. ‑ In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¼ to 1½ percent. The stance of remains accommodative, monetary policy Minutes of the Meeting of January 30–31, 2018_ Page 17 thereby supporting strong labor market condi- tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla- tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 per- cent inflation. This assessment will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international de- velopments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation develop- ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic condi- tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.” Voting for this action: Janet L. Yellen, William C. Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Jerome H. Powell, Randal K. Quarles, and John C. Williams. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 1½ percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2 percent.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, March 20–21, 2018. The meeting adjourned at 10:50 a.m. on Janu- ary 31, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on January 2, 2018, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on December 12–13, 2017. _____________________________ James A.

Willis, Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of St. Louis, New York, Boston, and Kansas City, respectively Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The deputy manager of the System Open Market Ac- count (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in domestic and global financial markets over the inter- meeting period; she also reported on open market oper- ations and related issues. Financial markets experienced a notable bout of volatility early in the intermeeting pe- riod; volatility was particularly pronounced in equity markets. Market participants pointed to incoming eco- nomic data released in early February—particularly data on average hourly earnings—as raising concerns about the prospects for higher inflation and higher interest rates. These concerns reportedly contributed to a steep decline in equity prices and an associated rise in measures of volatility. Some reports suggested that the increase in volatility was amplified by the unwinding of trading positions based on various types of volatility trading strategies. Measures of equity market volatility declined over subsequent weeks but remained above lev- els that prevailed earlier in the year, and stock prices fin- ished lower, on net, over the intermeeting period. Inter- est rates rose modestly over the period. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants suggested that revisions in investors’ views regarding the fiscal outlook were an important fac- tor boosting yields and contributing to a slightly steeper expected trajectory of the federal funds rate. The deputy manager noted that a rapid and sizable increase in Treas- ury bill issuance over recent weeks had put upward pres- sure on money market yields over the period. Three- month Treasury bill yields moved up significantly and those increases passed through to rates on other short- term instruments such as three-month Eurodollar de- posits and commercial paper. The spread of market rates on overnight repurchase agreements over the of- fering rate at the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse re- purchase (ON RRP) facility widened, and take-up at the facility fell to quite low levels as a result. Rates on over- night federal funds and Eurodollar transactions edged higher relative to the interest rate on excess reserves. The Desk continued to execute the FOMC’s balance sheet normalization plan initiated in October of last year. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open the Market Desk’s domestic intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. transactions over Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the March 20–21 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen through February and suggested that real gross domestic product (GDP) was rising at a moderate pace in the first quarter. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures January. (PCE), Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expecta- tions were little changed on balance. remained below 2 percent in Gains in total nonfarm payroll employment were strong over the two months ending in February. The labor force participation rate held steady in January and then stepped up markedly in February, with the participation Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ rates for prime-age (defined as ages 25 to 54) women and men moving up on net. The national unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent. Similarly, the unemploy- ment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics were roughly flat, on balance, in recent months. The share of workers employed part time for economic rea- sons edged up but remained close to its pre-recession levels. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits increased slightly, on net, over the two months ending in January, and the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low in early March. Recent readings showed that increases in labor compensation remained modest. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector advanced 2¾ percent over the four quarters of last year, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 2½ percent over the 12 months ending in February. Total industrial production expanded, on net, in January and February, with gains in both manufacturing and mining. Automakers’ schedules indicated that assem- blies of light motor vehicles would likely edge down in coming months. However, broader indicators of manu- facturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid increases in factory output in the near term. Consumer expenditures appeared likely to rise at a mod- est pace in the first quarter following a strong gain in the preceding quarter. Real PCE edged down in January, and the components of the nominal retail sales data used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its es- timate of PCE rose somewhat in February while the pace of light motor vehicle sales declined slightly. However, household spending was probably held back somewhat in February because of a delay in many federal tax re- funds, and the subsequent delivery of those refunds would likely contribute to an increase in consumer spending in March. Moreover, the lower tax withhold- ing resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year, which was beginning to show through in consumers’ paychecks, would likely provide some impetus to spend- ing in coming months. More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending—in- cluding gains in employment and real disposable per- sonal income, along with households’ elevated net worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, consumer senti- ment in early March, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, was at its highest level since 2004. Real residential investment looked to be slowing in the first quarter after rising briskly in the fourth quarter. Starts of new single-family homes increased in January and February, although building permit issuance moved down somewhat. Starts of multifamily units jumped in January but fell back in February. Sales of both new and existing homes declined in January. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property appeared to be moderat- ing in the first quarter after increasing at a solid pace in the preceding quarter. Nominal shipments of nonde- fense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in Jan- uary. However, recent forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending—such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional sur- veys—pointed to further solid gains in equipment spending in the near term. Firms’ nominal spending for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and min- ing sector declined in January. In contrast, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indica- tor of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to move up through mid- March. Total real government purchases seemed to be flattening out, on balance, in the first quarter after rising solidly in the fourth quarter. Nominal defense spending in Janu- ary and February was consistent with a decline in real federal purchases. In contrast, real purchases by state and local governments looked to be rising, as the pay- rolls of these governments increased in January and Feb- ruary and nominal state and local construction spending advanced somewhat in January. The change in net exports was a significant drag on real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, as imports grew rapidly. The nominal U.S. international trade defi- cit widened in January; exports declined, led by lower ex- ports of capital goods and industrial supplies, while im- ports were about flat. The slowing of real import growth following the rapid increase in the fourth quarter sug- gested that the drag on real GDP growth from net ex- ports would lessen in the first quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1¾ percent over the 12 months ending in January. Core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1½ percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2¼ percent over the 12 months ending in February, while core CPI inflation was 1¾ percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation expectations—including those from the Michi- gan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Foreign economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the fourth quarter. Real GDP growth picked up in Mexico but slowed a bit in some advanced foreign econ- omies (AFEs) and in emerging Asia. Recent indicators pointed to solid economic growth abroad in the first quarter of this year. Inflation abroad continued to be boosted by the pass-through to consumer prices of past increases in oil prices. However, excluding food and en- ergy prices, inflation remained subdued in many foreign economies, including the euro area and Japan. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Financial markets were turbulent over the intermeeting period, and market volatility increased notably. On net, U.S. equity prices declined, corporate bond spreads wid- ened, and nominal Treasury yields rose. Broad equity price indexes decreased over the intermeet- ing period. Market participants pointed to a larger-than- expected increase in average hourly earnings in the Jan- uary employment report as a factor triggering increased investor concerns about inflation and the associated pace of interest rate increases. Those concerns appeared to induce a substantial decline in equity prices. The de- cline may have been exacerbated by broader concerns about the level of stock market valuations. On Febru- ary 5, the VIX—an index of option-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&P 500 index—rose to its highest level since 2015, reportedly driven in part by the unwinding of investment strategies designed to profit from low volatility. Subsequently, equity prices recov- ered about half of their decline, and the VIX partially retraced its earlier increase. Monetary policy communications over the intermeeting period—including the January FOMC statement, the minutes of the January FOMC meeting, and the Chair- man’s semiannual testimony to the Congress—were generally viewed by market participants as signaling a somewhat stronger economic outlook and thus rein- forced expectations for further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. The probability of the next rate hike occurring at the March FOMC meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, increased to near certainty. Conditional on a March rate hike, the market-implied probability of an- other increase in the federal funds rate target range at the June FOMC meeting edged up to just above 70 percent. Expectations for the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 2020, derived from overnight index swap (OIS) quotes, moved up somewhat since late January. On net, the nominal Treasury yield curve shifted up and flattened a bit. Monetary policy communications, higher-than-expected domestic price data, and expecta- tions for increases in the supply of Treasury securities following the federal budget agreement in early February contributed to the increase in Treasury yields. Measures inflation compensation derived from Treasury of Inflation-Protected Securities were little changed on net. Option-implied volatility on longer-term rates rose no- tably following the jump in equity market volatility on February 5 but mostly retraced that increase by the end of the intermeeting period. On balance, spreads on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened but remained near the lower end of their historical ranges. In short-term funding markets, increased issuance of Treasury bills lifted Treasury bill yields above comparable-maturity OIS rates for the first time in al- most a decade. The rise in bill yields was a factor that pushed up money market rates and widened the spreads of certificates of deposit and term London interbank of- fered rates relative to OIS rates. The upward pressure on money market rates also showed up in slight increases in the effective federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate relative to the interest rate on excess re- serves. The rise in market rates on overnight repurchase agreements relative to the offering rate on the Federal Reserve’s ON RRP facility resulted in low levels of take- up at the facility. Reductions in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet continued as scheduled without a notable effect on markets. Despite the recent volatility in some financial markets, financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations and households remained accommodative over the inter- meeting period and continued to support further expan- sion of economic activity. Gross issuance of invest- ment- and speculative-grade bonds was slightly lower than usual in January and February, while gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans stayed strong. The pro- vision of bank-intermediated credit to businesses slowed further, likely reflecting weak loan demand rather than tight supply. Small business owners continued to report accommodative credit supply conditions but also weak demand for credit. Credit conditions in municipal bond markets remained accommodative. In commercial real estate markets, loan growth at banks slowed further in January and February. Financing con- ditions in commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) markets remained accommodative, as issuance Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ was robust (relative to the usual seasonal slowdown) and CMBS spreads continued to be at low levels. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative for most borrowers, though credit con- ditions stayed tight for borrowers with low credit scores or with hard-to-document incomes. Mortgage rates moved up, on net, over the period, along with the rise in other long-term rates. Consumer credit grew at a solid pace in January follow- ing a rapid expansion in the fourth quarter. Aggregate credit card balances continued to expand steadily in Jan- uary. Nonetheless, for subprime borrowers, conditions remained tight, with credit limits and balances still low by historical standards. Auto lending continued to grow at a moderate pace in recent months; although under- writing standards in the subprime segment continued to tighten, there were few signs of a significant restriction in credit supply for auto loans. Since the January FOMC meeting, foreign equity prices moved notably lower, on net, and generally declined more in the AFEs than in the United States. Longer- term yields on sovereign debt in AFEs either decreased moderately or ended the period little changed, in con- trast to the increase in U.S. Treasury yields. Weaker- than-expected economic data weighed on market-based measures of expected policy rate paths and on longer- term yields in Canada and in the euro area. Communi- cations from the Bank of Canada also seemed to con- tribute to the decline in Canadian yields. In the United Kingdom, longer-term yields were little changed, on net, although the market-based path of expected policy rates moved up moderately in response to Bank of England communications. In emerging market economies (EMEs), sovereign yield spreads widened modestly, and flows into EME mutual funds were volatile over the pe- riod. The broad nominal dollar index appreciated moderately over the period, largely reflecting an outsized deprecia- tion of the Canadian dollar and a massive devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. (The Venezuelan government devalued the official Venezuelan exchange rate by more than 99 percent against the dollar, bringing the official rate closer to its black market value.) Lower oil prices, weaker-than-expected economic data, and uncertainty over U.S. trade policy likely contributed to the weakness in the Canadian dollar. In contrast, the Japanese yen ap- preciated against the dollar, in part supported by safe- haven demand. Late in the intermeeting period, the Brit- ish pound was boosted by news of a preliminary agree- ment between U.K. and European Union authorities re- garding the transition period of the Brexit process, but the pound still ended the intermeeting period modestly weaker against the dollar. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for U.S. economic activity prepared for the March FOMC meeting was somewhat stronger, on balance, than the forecast at the time of the January meeting. The near-term forecast for real GDP growth was revised down a little; the incoming spending data were a bit softer than the staff had expected, and the staff judged that the softness was not associated with re- sidual seasonality in the data. However, the slowing in the pace of spending in the first quarter was expected to be transitory, and the medium-term projection for GDP growth was revised up modestly, largely reflecting the expected boost to GDP from the federal budget agree- ment enacted in February. Real GDP was projected to increase at a faster pace than potential output through 2020. The unemployment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. The projection for inflation over the medium term was revised up a bit, reflecting the slightly tighter resource utilization in the new forecast. The rates of both total and core PCE price inflation were projected to be faster in 2018 than in 2017. The staff projected that inflation would reach the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2019. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex- pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected. On the downside, those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy than the staff expected if the economy was already op- erating above its potential level and resource utilization continued to tighten, as the staff projected. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. An up- side risk was that inflation could increase more than ex- pected in an economy that was projected to move fur- ther above its potential. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged lower or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected. Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of economic conditions and the out- look, meeting participants agreed that information re- ceived since the FOMC met in January indicated that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate and that the labor market had continued to strengthen. Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unem- ployment rate had stayed low. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in recent months but remained low; survey- based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Participants noted incoming data suggesting some slow- ing in the rate of growth of household spending and business fixed investment after strong fourth-quarter readings. However, they expected that the first-quarter softness would be transitory, pointing to a variety of fac- tors, including delayed payment of some personal tax re- funds, residual seasonality in the data, and more gener- ally to strong economic fundamentals. Among the fun- damentals that participants cited were high levels of con- sumer and business sentiment, supportive financial con- ditions, improved economic conditions abroad, and re- cent changes in fiscal policy. Participants generally saw the news on spending and the labor market over the past few quarters as being consistent with continued above- trend growth and a further strengthening in labor mar- kets. Participants expected that, with further gradual in- creases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis was expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective over the medium term. Several partici- pants noted that the 12-month PCE price inflation rate would likely shift upward when the March data are re- leased because the effects of the outsized decline in the prices of cell phone service plans in March of last year will drop out of that calculation. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced, but participants agreed that it would be important to con- tinue to monitor inflation developments closely. Many participants reported considerable optimism among the business contacts in their Districts, consistent with a firming in business expenditures. Respondents to District surveys in both the manufacturing and service sectors were generally upbeat about the economic out- look. In some Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to continuing short- ages of workers in segments of the labor market. Activ- ity in the energy sector continued to expand, with con- tacts suggesting that further increases were likely, pro- vided that sufficient labor resources were forthcoming. In contrast, contacts in the agricultural sector reported that farm income continued to experience downward pressure due to low crop prices. A number of participants reported concern among their business contacts about the possible ramifications of the recent imposition of tariffs on imported steel and alumi- num. Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook, but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retalia- tion. Tax changes enacted late last year and the recent federal budget agreement, taken together, were expected to pro- vide a significant boost to output over the next few years. However, participants generally regarded the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of the fis- cal policy changes as uncertain, partly because there have been few historical examples of expansionary fiscal pol- icy being implemented when the economy was operating at a high level of resource utilization. A number of par- ticipants also suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook. A Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ few participants noted that the changes in tax policy could boost the level of potential output. Most participants described labor market conditions as strong, noting that payroll gains had remained well above the pace regarded as consistent with absorbing new labor force entrants over time, the unemployment rate had stayed low, job openings had been high, or that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits had been low. Many participants observed that the labor force participation rate had been higher recently than they had expected, helping to keep the unemployment rate flat over the past few months despite strong payroll gains. The firmness in the overall participation rate— relative to its demographically driven downward trend— and the rising participation rate of prime-age adults were regarded as signs of continued strengthening in labor market conditions. A few participants thought that these favorable developments could continue for a time, whereas others expressed doubts. A few participants warned against inferring too much from comparisons of the current low level of the unemployment rate with his- torical benchmarks, arguing that the much higher levels of education of today’s workforce—and the lower aver- age unemployment rate of more highly educated work- ers than less educated workers—suggested that the U.S. economy might be able to sustain lower unemployment rates than was the case in the 1950s or 1960s. In some Districts, reports from business contacts or ev- idence from surveys pointed to a pickup in wages, par- ticularly for unskilled or entry-level workers. However, business contacts or national surveys led a few partici- pants to conclude that some businesses facing labor shortages were changing job requirements so that they matched more closely the skills of available workers, in- creasing training, or offering more flexible work arrange- ments, rather than increasing wages in a broad-based fashion. Regarding wage growth at the national level, several participants noted a modest increase, but most still described the pace of wage gains as moderate; a few participants cited this fact as suggesting that there was room for the labor market to strengthen somewhat fur- ther. In some Districts, surveys or business contacts reported increases in nonwage costs, particularly in the cost of materials, and in a few Districts, contacts reported pass- ing on some of those costs in the form of higher prices. Contacts in a few Districts suggested that widely known, observable cost increases—such as those associated with rising commodity prices—would be more likely to be ac- cepted and passed through to final goods prices than would less observable costs such as wage increases. A few participants argued that either an absence of pricing power among at least some firms—perhaps stemming from globalization and technological innovations, in- cluding ones that facilitate price comparisons—or the ability of firms to find ways to cut costs of production has been damping inflationary pressures. Many partici- pants stated that recent readings from indicators on in- flation and inflation expectations increased their confi- dence that inflation would rise to the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective in coming months and then stabilize around that level; others suggested that downside risks to inflation were subsiding. In contrast, a few partici- pants cautioned that, despite increases in market-based measures of inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of infla- tion expectations, the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. In their discussion of developments in financial markets, some participants observed that financial conditions re- mained accommodative despite the rise in market vola- tility and repricing of assets that had occurred in Febru- ary. Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month’s turbulence in stride, al- though a few participants suggested that financial devel- opments over the intermeeting period highlighted some downside risks associated with still-high valuations for equities or from market volatility more generally. A few participants expressed concern that a lengthy period in which the economy operates beyond potential and fi- nancial conditions remain highly accommodative could, over time, pose risks to financial stability. In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan- cial developments for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strength- ened in recent months. In addition, all participants ex- pected inflation on a 12-month basis to move up in com- ing months. This expectation partly reflected the arith- metic effect of the soft readings on inflation in early 2017 dropping out of the calculation; it was noted that the increase in the inflation rate arising from this source was widely expected and, by itself, would not justify a change in the projected path for the federal funds rate. Most participants commented that the stronger eco- nomic outlook and the somewhat higher inflation read- ings in recent months had increased the likelihood of progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent inflation ob- jective. A few participants suggested that a modest in- Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ flation overshoot might help push up longer-term infla- tion expectations and anchor them at a level consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. A number of participants offered their views on the poten- tial benefits and costs associated with an economy oper- ating well above potential for a prolonged period while inflation remained low. On the one hand, the associated tightness in the labor market might help speed the return of inflation to the Committee’s 2 percent goal and in- duce a further increase in labor force participation; on the other hand, an overheated economy could result in significant inflation pressures or lead to financial insta- bility. Based on their current assessments, almost all partici- pants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. These partic- ipants agreed that, even after such an increase in the tar- get range, the stance of monetary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market condi- tions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. A couple of participants pointed to possible benefits of postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate until a subsequent meeting; these participants suggested that waiting for additional data to provide more evidence of a sustained return of the 12-month in- flation rate to 2 percent might more clearly demonstrate the data dependence of the Committee’s decisions and its resolve to achieve the price-stability component of its dual mandate. With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, all participants saw some further firming of the stance of monetary policy as likely to be warranted. Al- most all participants agreed that it remained appropriate to follow a gradual approach to raising the target range for the federal funds rate. Several participants com- mented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor market condi- tions and returning inflation to 2 percent on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventu- ally require an abrupt policy tightening. A number of participants indicated that the stronger outlook for eco- nomic activity, along with their increased confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term, implied that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be slightly steeper than they had previously expected. Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates. Several participants expressed the judgment that it would likely become appropriate at some point for the Committee to set the federal funds rate above its longer- run normal value for a time. Some participants sug- gested that, at some point, it might become necessary to revise statement language to acknowledge that, in pur- suit of the Committee’s statutory mandate and con- sistent with the median of participants’ policy rate pro- jections in the SEP, monetary policy eventually would likely gradually move from an accommodative stance to being a neutral or restraining factor for economic activ- ity. However, participants expressed a range of views on the amount of policy tightening that would likely be re- quired over the medium term to achieve the Commit- tee’s goals. Participants agreed that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in January indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains had been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. Recent data suggested that growth rates of household spending and business fixed invest- ment had moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had continued to run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation had increased in re- cent months but remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. All members viewed the recent data and other develop- ments bearing on real economic activity as suggesting that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months. In addition, notwithstanding increased market volatility over the in- termeeting period, financial conditions had stayed ac- commodative, and developments since the January meeting had indicated that fiscal policy was likely to pro- vide greater impetus to the economy over the next few years than members had previously thought. Conse- quently, members expected that, with further gradual ad- justments in the stance of monetary policy, economic ac- tivity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term, and labor market conditions would remain strong. Members generally continued to judge the risks to the economic outlook as remaining roughly balanced. Most members noted that recent readings on inflation, along with the strengthening of the economic outlook, Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ provided support for the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move up in coming months and stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term. Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent. They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus- tained return to 2 percent inflation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in- flation. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla- tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal. Members ex- pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man- ner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. They judged that raising the target range gradually would balance the risks to the outlook for inflation and unemployment and was most likely to support continued economic expansion. Members agreed that the strengthening in the economic outlook in recent months increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal funds rate would be ap- propriate. Members continued to anticipate that the fed- eral funds rate would likely remain, for some time, below levels that were expected to prevail in the longer run. Nonetheless, they again stated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective March 22, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent, including overnight re- verse repurchase operations (and reverse repur- chase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate week- end, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts lim- ited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during March that exceeds $12 billion, and to continue rein- vesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during March that exceeds $8 billion. Effective in April, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calen- dar month that exceeds $18 billion, and to rein- vest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $12 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to Minutes of the Meeting of March 20–21, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ run below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is ex- pected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly bal- anced, but the Committee is monitoring infla- tion developments closely. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1½ to 1¾ percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market condi- tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla- tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 per- cent inflation. This assessment will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international de- velopments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation develop- ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic condi- tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, William C. Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Randal K. Quarles, and John C. Williams. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances ¼ percentage point, to 1¾ percent, effective March 22, 2018. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ per- centage point increase in the primary credit rate (dis- count rate) to 2¼ percent, effective March 22, 2018.4 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, May 1–2, 2018. The meeting adjourned at 9:55 a.m. on March 21, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on February 20, 2018, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on January 30–31, 2018. _____________________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 4 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, At- lanta, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2¼ percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of March 22, 2018, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and Min- neapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2¼ percent, effective March 22, 2018.) The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establish- ment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on March 20–21, 2018, meet- ing participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1 Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ- ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af- fect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab- sence of further shocks to the economy.2 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out- comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat- isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that real GDP in 2018 would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run growth rate of real GDP. Participants generally saw real GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol- lowing two years, with almost all participants who sub- mitted longer-run projections anticipating that real GDP growth in 2020 would be at or within a few tenths of a percentage point of their longer-run estimates. All par- ticipants who submitted longer-run projections expected that, throughout the projection period, the unemploy- ment rate would run below their estimates of its longer- run level. All participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would rise to or toward the Committee’s 2 per- cent objective this year and would be at or a little above that objective by 2020. Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from December, a sub- stantial majority of participants marked up their projec- tions for real GDP growth and lowered their projections for the unemployment rate; participants indicated that these revisions reflected a number of factors, such as changes in fiscal policy, a stronger outlook for economic growth abroad, or recent strong job gains. For inflation, a majority of participants made slight upward revisions to their projections; these revisions were attributed to re- cent price data and the effects of a stronger economic outlook than in the December SEP. Table 1 and fig- ure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in- flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. Although the median of partici- pants’ projections for the federal funds rate at the end of 2018 was unchanged relative to the December SEP, a number of participants marked up their projections for this year. Moreover, a substantial majority of partici- pants revised up their federal funds rate projections for 2019 and 2020. The median of participants’ projections for the longer-run level of the federal funds rate was slightly higher relative to the December SEP. Nearly all participants who submitted longer-run projections ex- pected that evolving economic conditions would make it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move above their estimates of its longer-run level during part of the projection period. In general, participants continued to view the uncer- tainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years. As in Decem- ber, most participants judged the risks around their pro- jections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation to be broadly balanced. The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess- ments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.7 percent for this year and 2.4 percent for next year. The median projection for real GDP growth in 2020 was 2.0 percent, a touch above the 1.8 percent median of participants’ longer-run estimates. Most participants cited federal fis- cal policy developments—specifically, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018—as boosting their projections for economic ac- tivity over the next couple of years. Several participants mentioned other factors that influenced their economic 1 Three members of the Board of Governors were in office at the time of the March 2018 meeting, one member fewer than in December 2017. 2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.

Compared with the December SEP, the medians of par- ticipants’ projections for real GDP growth this year and next year were up a few tenths of a percentage point. Consistent with their projections for economic activity, almost all participants expected labor market conditions to strengthen further over the projection period. The medians of projections for the unemployment rate showed that rate stepping down from 4.1 percent in the final quarter of 2017 to 3.8 percent in the final quarter of this year, and then to 3.6 percent in the final quarters of 2019 and 2020. The median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate was 4.5 percent. Compared with the December SEP, almost all partici- pants marked down their unemployment rate projec- tions. Some participants also lowered their estimates of the longer-run level of the unemployment rate, leading to a small decline in the corresponding median projec- tion. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run. The distributions of individual projections for real GDP growth this year and next year shifted up noticeably from those in the December SEP; participants’ projections ranged from 2.5 to 3.0 percent in 2018 and from 2.0 to 2.8 percent in 2019. By contrast, the distributions of projected real GDP growth in 2020 and in the longer run shifted up modestly since December. Consistent with participants’ generally more upbeat outlook for real GDP growth, the distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate were lower than the corre- sponding distributions in December for each year of the projection period. The Outlook for Inflation The medians of participants’ projections for both total and core PCE price inflation were 1.9 percent in 2018— with all participants anticipating that each measure would rise from its 2017 rate—and 2.1 percent by 2020. Compared with the December SEP, the medians of par- ticipants’ projections for each measure were unchanged this year and up 0.1 percentage point in 2020. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri- butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in- flation. Participants generally made minor upward ad- justments to their inflation projections, resulting in slight shifts of the distributions to the right relative to the dis- tributions in December. Participants generally expected each measure to increase to no more than 2 percent this year and to rise to, or edge above, 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or mid- point of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and in the longer run. The distributions of projected policy rates through 2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with the revi- sions to participants’ projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. For 2018, there was a notable reduction in the dispersion of participants’ views, with most participants now regarding the appro- priate target at the end of the year as being between 2.13 and 2.62 percent. For each subsequent year, the disper- sion of participants’ year-end projections was somewhat greater than that in the December SEP, and the range of participants’ projections was noticeably larger than for 2018. The median of participants’ projections of the federal funds rate rises gradually to a level of 2.1 percent at the end of this year, 2.9 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020. The median of partici- pants’ longer-run estimates, at 2.9 percent, was a bit higher than in the December SEP. Nearly all partici- pants projected that it would likely be appropriate for the federal funds rate to rise above their individual longer-run estimates at some point over the forecast pe- riod. In discussing their projections, many participants con- tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases. This view was predi- cated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with, among other considerations, the possi- bility that inflation pressures and financial imbalances could build if economic activity were to run well above its long-run sustainable level and the possibility that the forces depressing inflation could prove to be more per- sistent than currently anticipated. Another factor men- tioned was the view that the neutral real interest rate was historically low and would likely move up only slowly. As always, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would depend on evolving economic conditions and their implications for participants’ economic outlooks and assessments of risks.

Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the path for the federal funds rate that, in their view, is likely to be appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic out- comes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the poten- tial benefits and costs should they occur. As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE inflation. Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts display the median SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence in- tervals derived from the forecast errors reported in ta- ble 2. If the degree of uncertainty attending these pro- jections is similar to the typical magnitude of past fore- cast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these varia- bles would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer- tainty attached to their economic projections about real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, a view that was essentially unchanged from December.3 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec- tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. As in December, most partici- pants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart. Partici- pants who saw the risks as skewed typically judged that the balance of risks was tilted toward stronger GDP growth, lower unemployment rates, and higher inflation. Compared with the December SEP, participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks attending their projections Table 2.

In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their projections, most participants noted that the magnitude and timing of the economic effects of recent changes in fiscal policy were uncertain or that fiscal policy develop- ments posed upside risks to real economic activity. Most participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk. A few participants noted that a prolonged period of tight labor markets posed risks of higher inflation, could fuel financial imbalances, and might contribute to heightened recession risks. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate are also subject to considerable uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the federal funds rate in response to actual and prospective devel- opments over time in real GDP growth, the unemploy- ment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the 3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Page 16Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second and third years. The corre- sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla- tion would be 1.1 to 2.9 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confi- dence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and cen- tered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. How- ever, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate can- not be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the down- side, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.

Broad measures of financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent weeks, with U.S. equity prices lower, the foreign exchange value of the dollar moderately higher, and longer-term Treasury yields up a little. Mar- ket participants pointed to a range of factors contrib- uting to the decline in stock prices, including concerns about the outlook for trade policy both in the United 4 Attended through the discussion on financial stability issues. States and abroad, the potential for increased regulatory oversight of U.S. technology companies, and incoming data suggesting some moderation in global economic growth. The rise in nominal U.S. Treasury yields was associated with an increase in inflation compensation that, in turn, seemed to reflect a firming in inflation data as well as a notable rise in crude oil prices. Judging from federal funds futures quotes, the expected path of the federal funds rate changed relatively little over the inter- meeting period. While term LIBOR (London interbank offered rates) had widened relative to comparable- maturity OIS (overnight index swap) rates in recent months, the cost of dollar funding through the foreign exchange swap market had not risen to the same degree. Recent usage of standing U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines had been low, consistent with a view that the recent wid- ening in LIBOR–OIS spreads did not reflect increased funding pressures or rising concerns about the condition of financial institutions. The manager discussed the role of standing liquidity swap lines in supporting financial stability and recom- mended that these swap lines be renewed at this meeting following the usual annual schedule. The manager also discussed current projections for principal payments re- ceived from mortgage-backed securities (MBS) held in the SOMA. These projections suggested that, under the Committee’s plan for balance sheet normalization, rein- vestments of MBS principal would likely cease later this year, although the timing is uncertain. The deputy manager followed with a briefing focused on recent developments in the federal funds market, noting that the effective federal funds rate had increased in re- cent weeks and had moved toward the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. In large part, this devel- opment seemed to reflect a firming in rates on repur- chase agreements (repos) that, in turn, had resulted from an increase in Treasury bill issuance and the associated higher demands for repo financing by dealers and others. Higher rates had reportedly made repos a more attrac- tive alternative investment for major lenders in the fed- eral funds market, thus reducing the availability of fund- ing in that market and putting some upward pressure on the federal funds rate. While some of the recent pressure on the federal funds rate could be expected to fade over coming weeks as the market adjusts to higher levels of Treasury bills, the gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the accompanying decline in Page 2 _Federal Open Market Committee reserves was anticipated to continue putting some up- ward pressure on the federal funds rate relative to the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. The deputy manager then discussed the possibility of a small technical realignment of the IOER rate relative to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. Since the target range was established in December 2008, the IOER rate has been set at the top of the target range to help keep the effective federal funds rate within the range. Lately the spread of the IOER rate over the effective federal funds rate had narrowed to only 5 basis points. A technical adjustment of the IOER rate to a level 5 basis points below the top of the target range could keep the effective federal funds rate well within the target range. This could be accomplished by imple- menting a 20 basis point increase in the IOER rate at a time when the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. Alternatively, the IOER rate could be lowered 5 basis points at a meeting in which the Committee left the target range for the fed- eral funds rate unchanged. In their discussion of this issue, participants generally agreed that it could become appropriate to make a small technical adjustment in the Federal Reserve’s approach to implementing monetary policy by setting the IOER rate modestly below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. Such an adjustment would be con- sistent with the Committee’s statement in the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that it would be pre- pared to adjust the details of the approach to policy im- plementation during the period of normalization in light of economic and financial developments. Many partici- pants judged that it would be useful to make such a tech- nical adjustment sooner rather than later. Participants generally agreed that it would be desirable to make that adjustment at a time when the FOMC decided to in- crease the target range for the federal funds rate; that timing would simplify FOMC communications and em- phasize that the IOER rate is a helpful tool for imple- menting the FOMC’s policy decisions but does not, in itself, convey the stance of policy. While additional tech- nical adjustments in the IOER rate could become nec- essary over time, these were not expected to be frequent. A number of participants also suggested that, before too long, the Committee might want to further discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen in recent years. The Committee voted unanimously to renew the recip- rocal currency arrangements with the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Mexico; these arrangements are associ- ated with the Federal Reserve’s participation in the North American Framework Agreement of 1994. In ad- dition, the Committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the European Central Bank, and the Swiss Na- tional Bank. The votes to renew the Federal Reserve’s participation in these standing arrangements are taken annually at the April or May FOMC meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet- ing period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System’s account during the intermeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the May 1–2 meeting in- dicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in the first quarter, while real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a moderate pace. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12‐month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), was 2 percent in March. Survey‐ based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were, on balance, little changed. Total nonfarm payroll employment rose less in March than in the previous two months, but the increase for the first quarter as a whole was solid. The labor force participation rate edged down in March but moved up a little, on net, in the first quarter. The national unemploy- ment rate remained at 4.1 percent for a sixth consecutive month. Similarly, the unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics were roughly flat, on balance, in recent months. The share of workers em- ployed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a rate close to that prevailing before the previous re- cession. The rate of private-sector job openings stayed at an elevated level in February, the rate of quits re- mained high, and initial claims for unemployment insur- ance benefits continued to be low through mid-April. Recent readings showed that increases in labor compen- sation stepped up modestly over the past year. The em- ployment cost index for private workers rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in March, and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2.7 percent over that period. Both increases were larger than those re- ported for the 12 months ending in March 2017. Total industrial production increased in March and rose at a solid pace for the first quarter as a whole, with gains Minutes of the Meeting of May 1–2, 2018_ Page 3 in the output of manufacturers, mines, and utilities. Au- tomakers’ schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would edge down in the second quarter from the average pace in the first quarter, but broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufactur- ing surveys, continued to point to further gains in factory output in the near term. Consumer expenditures rose at a modest pace in the first quarter following a strong gain in the preceding quarter. Monthly data pointed to some improvement toward the end of the quarter, as real PCE moved up in March after declining in January and February. However, the recent movements might have partly reflected the effects of a delay in many federal tax refunds, which could have shifted some consumer spending from February to March. Light motor vehicle sales stepped down in the first quarter after a strong fourth-quarter pace that was partly boosted by replacement sales following the fall hurricanes; sales declined in April, but indicators of ve- hicle demand remained upbeat. More broadly, key fac- tors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment and real disposable personal income, along with households’ elevated net worth—should con- tinue to support solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, the lower tax withholding resulting from the tax cuts enacted late last year was likely to provide some impetus to spending in coming months. Consumer sen- timent, as measured by the University of Michigan Sur- veys of Consumers, remained elevated in April. Real residential investment was unchanged in the first quarter after a strong increase in the fourth quarter. Starts for new single-family homes decreased in March, but the average pace in the first quarter was little changed from the fourth quarter. In contrast, starts of multifamily units moved up in March after contracting in February, and they were higher in the first quarter than in the fourth. Sales of both new and existing homes increased in February and March. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in- tellectual property increased at a moderate pace in the first quarter after rising briskly in the second half of last year. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in March. However, forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending—such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business senti- ment from national and regional surveys—continued to point to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term. Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures rose at a robust pace in the first quarter, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in opera- tion—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—continued to move up through mid-April. Total real government purchases rose at a slower rate in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter. Real federal purchases increased in the first quarter, with gains in both defense and nondefense spending. Real purchases by state and local governments also moved higher; state and local government payrolls were unchanged in the first quarter, but nominal construction spending by these governments rose somewhat. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in February as imports rose briskly, outpacing the increase in exports. Preliminary data on trade in goods suggested that the trade deficit narrowed sharply in March, with exports continuing to grow robustly but imports retrac- ing earlier gains. The Bureau of Economic Analysis es- timated that the change in real net exports added slightly to growth of real GDP in the first quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2 percent over the 12 months end- ing in March. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4 percent over the 12 months ending in March, while core CPI inflation was 2.1 percent. Re- cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Michi- gan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace. Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several emerging market economies (EMEs), including Mexico, China, and some other parts of emerging Asia. However, incoming data in a number of advanced foreign economies (AFEs)— in particular, real GDP in the United Kingdom— showed somewhat slower growth than market partici- pants were expecting, partly because of transitory factors such as severe weather. Overall, inflation in most AFEs and EMEs continued to be subdued, increasing in the AFEs in the first quarter on higher energy prices but Page 4 _Federal Open Market Committee stepping down some in the EMEs, partly reflecting lower food prices in some Asian economies. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Early in the intermeeting period, uncertainty over trade policy and negative news about the technology sector re- portedly contributed to lower prices for risky assets, but these concerns subsequently seemed to recede amid stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports. Eq- uity prices declined, nominal Treasury yields increased modestly, and market-based measures of inflation com- pensation ticked up on net. Meanwhile, financing con- ditions for nonfinancial businesses and households largely remained supportive of spending. FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were generally viewed by market participants as reflect- ing an upbeat outlook for economic growth and as con- sistent with a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accommodation. The FOMC’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at the March meeting was widely anticipated. Market re- action to the release of the March FOMC minutes later in the intermeeting period was minimal. The probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the May FOMC meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, remained close to zero; the probability of an increase at the June FOMC meeting rose to about 90 percent by the end of the intermeeting period. Expected levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 2020 implied by OIS rates rose modestly. The nominal Treasury yield curve continued to flatten over the intermeeting period, with yields on 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities up 17 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively. Measures of inflation compensa- tion derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securi- ties increased 4 basis points and 7 basis points at the 5- and 5-to-10-year horizons, respectively, against a backdrop of rising oil prices. Option-implied measures of volatility of longer-term interest rates continued to decline over the intermeeting period after their marked increase earlier this year. The S&P 500 index decreased over the period on net. Equity prices declined early in the intermeeting period, reportedly in response to trade tensions between the United States and China as well as negative news about the technology sector. However, equity prices subse- quently retraced some of the earlier declines as concerns about trade policy seemed to ease and corporate earn- ings reports for the first quarter of 2018 generally came in stronger than expected. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon—the VIX—declined but remained at elevated levels relative to 2017, ending the period at approximately 15 percent. On net, spreads of yields of investment-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened a bit, while spreads for speculative-grade cor- porate bonds were unchanged. Conditions in short-term funding markets remained generally stable over the intermeeting period. Spreads on term money market instruments relative to comparable- maturity OIS rates were still larger than usual in some segments of the money market. Reflecting the FOMC’s policy action in March, yields on a broad set of money market instruments moved about 25 basis points higher. Bill yields also stayed high relative to OIS rates as cumu- lative Treasury bill supply remained elevated. Money market dynamics over quarter-end were muted relative to previous quarter-ends. Foreign equity markets were mixed over the intermeet- ing period, with investors attuned to developments re- lated to U.S. and Chinese trade policies and to news about the U.S. technology sector. Broad Japanese and European equity indexes outperformed their U.S. coun- terparts, ending the period somewhat higher. Market- based measures of policy expectations and longer-term yields were little changed in the euro area and Japan but declined modestly in the United Kingdom on weaker- than-expected economic data. Longer-term yields in Canada moved up moderately amid notably higher oil prices. In EMEs, sovereign bond spreads edged up; cap- ital continued to flow into EME mutual funds, although at a slower pace lately. On net, the broad nominal dollar index appreciated moderately over the intermeeting period. In the early part of the period, the index depreciated slightly, as rela- tively positive news about the current round of NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) negotiations led to appreciation of the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, two currencies with large weights in the index. Later in the period, there was a broad-based appreciation of the dollar against most currencies as U.S. yields in- creased relative to those in AFEs and as the Mexican peso declined amid uncertainty associated with the up- coming presidential elections. Growth in banks’ commercial and industrial (C&I) loans strengthened in March and the first half of April follow- ing relatively weak growth in January and February. Re- spondents to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that their institutions had eased standards and terms on Minutes of the Meeting of May 1–2, 2018_ Page 5 C&I loans in the first quarter, most often citing in- creased competition from other lenders as the reason for doing so. Gross issuance of corporate bonds and lever- aged loans was strong in March, and equity issuance was robust. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations was stable over the intermeeting period, and the ratio of aggregate debt to assets remained near multidecade highs. Commercial real estate (CRE) financing conditions re- mained accommodative over the intermeeting period. CRE loan growth at banks strengthened in March but edged down in the first half of April. Spreads on com- mercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained near their post-crisis lows. CMBS issuance continued to be strong in March but slowed somewhat in April. Re- spondents to the April SLOOS reported easing stan- dards on nonfarm nonresidential loans and tightening standards on multifamily loans, whereas standards on construction and land development loans were little changed in the first quarter. Meanwhile, respondents in- dicated weaker demand for loans across these three CRE loan categories. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative for most borrowers in March and April. For borrowers with low credit scores, condi- tions continued to ease, but credit remained relatively tight and the volume of mortgage loans extended to this group remained low. Banks responding to the April SLOOS reported weaker loan demand across most resi- dential real estate (RRE) loan categories, while standards were reportedly about unchanged for most RRE loan types in the first quarter. Consumer credit growth moderated in March and the first half of April. Respondents to the April SLOOS re- ported that standards and terms on auto and credit card loans tightened, and that demand for these loans weak- ened in the first quarter. On balance, credit remained readily available to prime-rated borrowers, but tight for subprime borrowers, over the intermeeting period. The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability; the report again characterized the fi- nancial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. This overall assessment incorpo- rated the staff’s judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures, while having come down a little in recent months, nonetheless continued to be el- evated. The staff judged vulnerabilities from financial- sector leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation to be low, vulnerabilities from household leverage as be- ing in the low-to-moderate range, and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as ele- vated. The staff also characterized overall vulnerabilities to foreign financial stability as moderate while highlight- ing specific issues in some foreign economies, includ- ing—depending on the country—elevated asset valua- tion pressures, high private or sovereign debt burdens, and political uncertainties. Staff Economic Outlook The staff projection for U.S. economic activity prepared for the May FOMC meeting continued to suggest that the economy was expanding at an above-trend pace. Real GDP growth, which slowed in the first quarter, was expected to pick up in the second quarter and to outpace potential output growth through 2020. The unemploy- ment rate was projected to decline further over the next few years and to continue to run below the staff’s esti- mate of its longer-run natural rate over this period. Rel- ative to the forecast prepared for the March meeting, the projection for real GDP growth in 2018 was revised down a little, primarily in response to incoming con- sumer spending data that were somewhat softer than the staff had expected. Beyond 2018, the projection for GDP growth was essentially unrevised. With real GDP rising a little less, on balance, over the forecast period, the projected decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years was also a touch smaller than in the pre- vious forecast. The near-term projection for consumer price inflation was revised up slightly in response to incoming data on prices. Beyond the near term, the forecast for inflation was a bit lower than in the previous projection, reflecting the slightly higher unemployment rate in the new fore- cast. The rates of both total and core PCE price infla- tion were projected to be faster in 2018 than in 2017. The staff projected that total PCE inflation would be near the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the next several years. Total PCE inflation was expected to run slightly below core inflation in 2019 and 2020 because of a projected decline in energy prices. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex- pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected. On the downside, those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy Page 6 _Federal Open Market Committee than the staff expected if the economy was already op- erating above its potential level and resource utilization continued to tighten, as the staff projected. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. An up- side risk was that inflation could increase more than ex- pected in an economy that was projected to move fur- ther above its potential. Downside risks included the possibilities that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed or that the run of low core inflation readings last year could prove to be more per- sistent than the staff expected. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. Recent data sug- gested that growth of household spending had moder- ated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compen- sation remained low; survey-based measures of longer- term inflation expectations were little changed, on bal- ance. Participants viewed recent readings on spending, em- ployment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook. Real GDP growth slowed somewhat less in the first quarter than anticipated at the time of the March meet- ing, and participants expected that the moderation in the growth of consumer spending early in the year would prove temporary. They noted a number of economic fundamentals were currently supporting continued above-trend economic growth; these included a strong labor market, federal tax and spending policies, high lev- els of household and business confidence, favorable fi- nancial conditions, and strong economic growth abroad. Participants generally expected that further gradual in- creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with solid expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Participants generally viewed the risks to the economic outlook to be roughly balanced. Participants generally reported that their business con- tacts were optimistic about the economic outlook. However, in a number of Districts, contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and trade restrictions, including the potential for postponing or pulling back on capital spending. Labor markets were generally strong, and contacts in a number of Districts reported shortages of workers in specific industries or occupations. In some cases, labor shortages were con- tributing to upward pressure on wages. In many Dis- tricts, business contacts experienced rising costs of nonlabor inputs, particularly trucking, rail, and shipping rates and prices of steel, aluminum, lumber, and petroleum-based commodities. Reports on the ability of firms to pass through higher costs to customers varied across Districts. Activity in the energy sector remained strong, and crude oil production was expected to con- tinue to expand in response to rising global demand. In contrast, in agricultural areas, low crop prices continued to weigh on farm income. It was noted that the potential for higher Chinese tariffs on key agricultural products could, in the longer run, hurt U.S. competitiveness. Participants generally agreed that labor market condi- tions strengthened further during the first quarter of the year. Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains, averaging 200,000 per month. The unemployment rate was unchanged, but at a level below most estimates of its longer-run normal rate. Both the overall labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ra- tio moved up. The first-quarter data from the employ- ment cost index indicated that the strength in the labor market was showing through to a gradual pickup in wage increases, although the signal from other wage measures was less clear. Many participants commented that over- all wage pressures were still moderate or were strong only in industries and occupations experiencing very tight labor supply; several of them noted that recent wage developments provided little evidence of general overheating in the labor market. With economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or to decline further below, their estimates of its longer-run normal rate. Several participants also saw scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce. However, a few others questioned whether tight labor markets would have a lasting positive effect on labor force participation. The 12-month changes in overall and core PCE prices moved up in March, to 2 percent and 1.9 percent, re- spectively. Most participants viewed the recent firming in inflation as providing some reassurance that inflation Minutes of the Meeting of May 1–2, 2018_ Page 7 was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee’s symmet- ric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis. In particular, the recent readings appeared to support the view that the downside surprises last year were largely transitory. Some participants noted that inflation was likely to mod- estly overshoot 2 percent for a time. However, several participants suggested that the underlying trend in infla- tion had changed little, noting that some of the recent increase in inflation may have represented transitory price changes in some categories of health care and fi- nancial services, or that various measures of underlying inflation, such as the 12-month trimmed mean PCE in- flation rate from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, re- mained relatively stable at levels below 2 percent. In dis- cussing the outlook for inflation, many participants em- phasized that, after an extended period of low inflation, the Committee’s longer-run policy objective was to re- turn inflation to its symmetric 2 percent goal on a sus- tained basis. Many saw tight resource utilization, the pickup in wage increases and nonlabor input costs, and stable inflation expectations as supporting their projec- tions that inflation would remain near 2 percent over the medium term. But a few cautioned that, although market-based measures of inflation compensation had moved up over recent months, in their view these measures, as well as some survey-based measures, re- mained at levels somewhat below those that would be consistent with an expectation of sustained 2 percent in- flation as measured by the PCE price index. Participants commented on a number of risks and un- certainties associated with their expectations for eco- nomic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. Some participants saw a risk that, as re- source utilization continued to tighten, supply con- straints could develop that would intensify upward wage and price pressures, or that financial imbalances could emerge, which could eventually erode the sustainability of the economic expansion. Alternatively, some partici- pants thought that a strengthening labor market could bring a further increase in labor supply, allowing the un- employment rate to decline further with less upward pressure on wages and prices. Another area of uncer- tainty was the outlook for fiscal and trade policies. Sev- eral participants continued to note the challenge of as- sessing the timing and magnitude of the effects of recent fiscal policy changes on household and business spend- ing and on labor supply over the next several years. In addition, they saw the trajectory of fiscal policy thereaf- ter as difficult to forecast. With regard to trade policies, a number of participants viewed the range of possible outcomes for economic activity and inflation to be par- ticularly wide, depending on what actions were taken by the United States and how U.S trading partners re- sponded. And some participants observed that while these policies were being debated and negotiations con- tinued, the uncertainty surrounding trade issues could damp business sentiment and spending. In their discus- sion of the outlook for inflation, a few participants also noted the risk that, if global oil prices remained high or moved higher, U.S. inflation would be boosted by the direct effects and pass-through of higher energy costs. Financial conditions tightened somewhat over the inter- meeting period but remained accommodative overall. The foreign exchange value of the dollar rose modestly, but this move retraced only a bit of the depreciation of the dollar since its 2016 peak. With their decline over the intermeeting period, equity prices were about un- changed, on net, since the beginning of the year but were still near their historical highs. Longer-term Treasury yields rose, but somewhat less than shorter-term yields, and the yield curve flattened somewhat further. In commenting on the staff’s assessment of financial sta- bility, a couple of participants noted that after the bout of financial market volatility in early February, the use of investment strategies predicated on a low-volatility envi- ronment may have become less prevalent, and that some investors may have become more cautious. However, asset valuations across a range of markets and leverage in the nonfinancial corporate sector remained elevated relative to historical norms, leaving some borrowers vul- nerable to unexpected negative shocks. With regard to the ability of the financial system to absorb such shocks, several participants commented that regulatory reforms since the crisis had contributed to appreciably stronger capital and liquidity positions in the financial sector. In this context, a few participants emphasized the need to build additional resilience in the financial sector at this point in the economic expansion. In their consideration of monetary policy over the near term, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and financial developments for the outlook for economic growth, labor market conditions, and in- flation and, in turn, for the appropriate path of the fed- eral funds rate. All participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the May meeting. Participants concurred that information received during the intermeeting period had not materi- ally altered their assessment of the outlook for the econ- omy. Participants commented that above-trend growth Page 8 _Federal Open Market Committee in real GDP in recent quarters, together with somewhat higher recent inflation readings, had increased their con- fidence that inflation on a 12-month basis would con- tinue to run near the Committee’s longer-run 2 percent symmetric objective. That said, it was noted that it was premature to conclude that inflation would remain at levels around 2 percent, especially after several years in which inflation had persistently run below the Commit- tee’s 2 percent objective. In light of subdued inflation over recent years, a few participants observed that ad- justments in the stance of policy should take account of the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations have drifted a bit below levels consistent with the Com- mittee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Most participants judged that if incoming information broadly confirmed their current economic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate for the Committee to take another step in removing policy accommodation. Overall, participants agreed that the current stance of monetary policy re- mained accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation on a sus- tained basis. With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, all participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assess- ments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the Committee’s statutory objectives. Participants generally agreed with the assess- ment that continuing to raise the target range for the fed- eral funds rate gradually would likely be appropriate if the economy evolves about as expected. These partici- pants commented that this gradual approach was most likely to be conducive to maintaining strong labor mar- ket conditions and achieving the symmetric 2 percent in- flation objective on a sustained basis without resulting in conditions that would eventually require an abrupt pol- icy tightening. A few participants commented that re- cent news on inflation, against a background of contin- ued prospects for a solid pace of economic growth, sup- ported the view that inflation on a 12-month basis would likely move slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent ob- jective for a time. It was also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee’s symmetric inflation ob- jective and could be helpful in anchoring longer-run in- flation expectations at a level consistent with that objec- tive. Meeting participants also discussed the recent flatter profile of the term structure of interest rates. Partici- pants pointed to a number of factors contributing to the flattening of the yield curve, including the expected grad- ual rise of the federal funds rate, the downward pressure on term premiums from the Federal Reserve’s still-large balance sheet as well as asset purchase programs by other central banks, and a reduction in investors’ esti- mates of the longer-run neutral real interest rate. A few participants noted that such factors could make the slope of the yield curve a less reliable signal of future However, several participants economic activity. thought that it would be important to continue to mon- itor the slope of the yield curve, emphasizing the histor- ical regularity that an inverted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of recession. Participants commented on how the Committee’s com- munications in its postmeeting statement might need to be revised in coming meetings if the economy evolved broadly as expected. A few participants noted that if in- creases in the target range for the federal funds rate con- tinued, the federal funds rate could be at or above their estimates of its longer-run normal level before too long. In addition, a few observed that the neutral level of the federal funds rate might currently be lower than their es- timates of its longer-run level. In light of this, some par- ticipants noted it might soon be appropriate to revise the forward-guidance language in the statement indicating that the “federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run” or to modify the language stating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” Participants expressed a range of views on the amount of further policy firming that would likely be required over the medium term to achieve the Committee’s goals. Participants indicated that the Committee, in making policy decisions over the next few years, should conduct policy with the aim of keeping inflation near its longer- run symmetric objective while sustaining the economic expansion and a strong labor market. Participants agreed that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming information. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in March indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the un- employment rate had stayed low. Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed in- vestment continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month Minutes of the Meeting of May 1–2, 2018_ Page 9 basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent. In particular, in March the 12-month percent increase in PCE prices was equal to the Committee’s longer-run ob- jective of 2 percent, while the measure excluding food and energy prices was only slightly below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation re- mained low, and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. All members viewed the recent data as indicating that the outlook for the economy had changed little since the previous meeting. In addition, financial conditions, al- though somewhat tighter than at the time of the March FOMC meeting, had stayed accommodative overall, while fiscal policy was likely to provide sizable impetus to the economy over the next few years. Consequently, members expected that, with further gradual adjust- ments to the stance of monetary policy, economic activ- ity would expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions would remain strong. Members agreed that inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 per- cent objective over the medium term. Members judged that the risks to the economic outlook appeared to be roughly balanced. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent in- flation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in- flation. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of infla- tion pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. Members also agreed that they would carefully monitor actual and expected developments in inflation in relation to the Committee’s symmetric inflation goal. Members ex- pected that economic conditions would evolve in a man- ner that would warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. Members agreed that the federal funds rate was likely to remain, for some time, below levels that they expected to prevail in the longer run. However, they noted that the actual path of the federal funds rate would depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe- cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective May 3, 2018, the Federal Open Mar- ket Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to main- tain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1½ to 1¾ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol- iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer- ing rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per- counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $18 billion, and to re- invest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $12 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate. Job gains have been strong, on Page 10 _Federal Open Market Committee average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while busi- investment continued to grow ness fixed strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall in- flation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensa- tion remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will ex- pand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to run near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Risks to the eco- nomic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1½ to 1¾ percent. The stance of remains accommodative, monetary policy thereby supporting strong labor market condi- tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla- tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 per- cent inflation. This assessment will take into ac- count a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international de- velopments. The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation develop- ments relative to its symmetric inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic condi- tions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, William C. Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Randal K. Quarles, and John C. Williams. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 1¾ percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2¼ percent.5 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, June 12–13, 2018. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on May 2, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on April 10, 2018, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on March 20–21, 2018. _____________________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 5 The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and sea- sonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates.

Wright, Senior Vice Presidents, Federal Reserve Banks of Dallas, New York, and Minneapolis, respectively Roc Armenter, Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia Willem Van Zandweghe, Assistant Vice President, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in do- mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet- ing period. Developments in emerging market econo- mies (EMEs) and in Europe were the focus of consider- able attention by financial market participants over re- cent weeks. Investor perceptions of increased economic and political vulnerabilities in several EMEs led to a no- table depreciation in EME currencies relative to the dol- lar. Market participants reported that an unwinding of investor positions had been a factor amplifying these currency moves. In Europe, concerns about the political situation in Italy and its potential economic implications prompted a significant widening in risk spreads on Ital- ian sovereign securities. The share prices of Italian banks and other banks that could be exposed to Italy declined sharply. In domestic financial markets, expec- tations for the path of the federal funds rate were little changed over the intermeeting period. The manager noted that the release of the minutes of the May FOMC meeting, and particularly the reference to a possible tech- nical adjustment in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate relative to the top of the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate, prompted a small reduc- tion in federal funds futures rates. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of money markets and open market operations. Rates on Treasury repurchase agreements (repo) had remained el- evated in recent weeks, apparently responding, in part, to increased Treasury issuance over recent months. In light of the firmness in repo rates, the volume of opera- tions conducted through the Federal Reserve’s over- night reverse repurchase agreement facility remained low. Elevated repo rates may also have contributed to some upward pressure on the effective federal funds rate in recent weeks as lenders in that market shifted some of their investments to earn higher rates available in repo markets. The deputy manager also discussed the current outlook for reinvestment purchases of agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS). Based on current projections, principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency MBS would likely be lower than the monthly cap on redemptions that will be in effect beginning in the fall of this year. Consistent with the June 2017 addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, rein- vestment purchases of agency MBS then are projected Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ to fall to zero from that point onward. However, prin- cipal payments on agency MBS are sensitive to changes in various factors, particularly long-term interest rates. As a result, agency MBS principal payments could rise above the monthly redemption cap in some future sce- narios and thus require MBS reinvestment purchases. In light of this possibility, the deputy manager described plans for the Desk to conduct small value purchases of agency MBS on a regular basis in order to maintain op- erational readiness. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Open Market Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeet- ing period. There were no intervention operations in for- eign currencies for the System's account during the in- termeeting period. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the June 12–13 meeting indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months, and that real gross domes- tic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a solid rate in the first half of the year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2 percent in April. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong pace, on average, in April and May. The national unem- ployment rate edged down in both months and was 3.8 percent in May. The unemployment rates for Afri- can Americans, Asians, and Hispanics all declined, on net, from March to May; the rate for African Americans was the lowest on record but still noticeably above the rates for other groups. The overall labor force partici- pation rate edged down in April and May but was still at about the same level as a year earlier. The share of work- ers employed part time for economic reasons was little changed at a level close to that from just before the pre- vious recession. The rate of private-sector job openings rose in March and stayed at that elevated level in April; the rate of quits edged up, on net, over those two months; and initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits continued to be low through early June. Recent readings showed that increases in labor compensation stepped up over the past year. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2.7 percent over the four quarters ending in the first quarter of this year (compared with 1.9 percent over the same four quarters a year earlier), and average hourly earnings for all employees increased 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in May (compared with 2.5 percent over the same 12 months a year earlier). Total industrial production increased at a solid pace in April, but the available indicators for May, particularly production worker hours in manufacturing, indicated that output declined in that month. Automakers’ sched- ules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would increase in the coming months, and broader indi- cators of manufacturing production, such as the new or- ders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, continued to point to solid gains in factory out- put in the near term. Consumer spending appeared to be increasing briskly in the second quarter after rising at only a modest pace in the first quarter. Real PCE increased at a robust pace in April after a strong gain in March. Although light motor vehicle sales declined in May, indicators of vehicle de- mand generally remained upbeat. More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spend- ing—including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—contin- ued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. In addition, the lower tax withholding result- ing from the tax cuts enacted late last year still appeared likely to provide some additional impetus to spending in coming months. Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, re- mained elevated in May. Residential investment appeared to be declining further in the second quarter after decreasing in the first quarter. Starts for new single-family homes were unchanged in April from their first-quarter average, but starts of mul- tifamily units declined noticeably. Sales of both new and existing homes decreased in April. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in- tellectual property appeared to be rising at a moderate pace in the second quarter after a somewhat faster in- crease in the first quarter. Nominal shipments of non- defense capital goods excluding aircraft rose in April, and forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending—such as the backlog of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business senti- ment from national and regional surveys—continued to point to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term. Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures appeared to be expanding at a solid pace again in the second quarter, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business Minutes of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ spending for structures in the drilling and mining sec- tor—increased, on net, from mid-April through early June. Nominal federal government spending data for April and May pointed to an increase in real federal purchases in the second quarter. Real state and local government purchases also appeared to be moving up; although nominal construction expenditures by these govern- ments edged down in April, their payrolls rose at a mod- erate pace, on net, in April and May. Net exports made a negligible contribution to real GDP growth in the first quarter, with growth of both real ex- ports and real imports slowing from the brisk pace of the fourth quarter of last year. After narrowing in March, the nominal trade deficit narrowed further in April, as exports continued to increase while imports de- clined slightly, which suggested that net exports might add modestly to real GDP growth in the second quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2.0 percent over the 12 months ending in April. Core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.8 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla- tion expectations—including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity continued to expand at a solid pace. Real GDP growth picked up in the first quarter in several EMEs—includ- ing Mexico, China, and much of emerging Asia—al- though recent indicators pointed to some moderation in the pace of activity in most EMEs. By contrast, in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), real GDP growth slowed in the first quarter, owing partly to temporary factors such as labor strikes in some European countries and bad weather in Japan. More recent indicators pointed to a partial rebound in AFE economic growth in the second quarter. Inflation pressures in the foreign economies generally remained subdued, even though higher oil prices put some upward pressure on headline inflation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation During the intermeeting period, global financial markets were buffeted by increased concerns about the outlook for foreign growth and political developments in Italy, but these concerns subsequently eased. On net, Treas- ury yields were little changed despite significant intra- period moves, and the dollar appreciated notably as a range of AFE and EME currencies and sovereign bonds came under pressure. However, broad domestic stock price indexes increased, on net, as generally strong cor- porate earnings reports helped support prices. Mean- while, financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activ- ity on balance. Over the intermeeting period, macroeconomic data re- leases signaling moderating growth in some foreign economies, along with downside risks stemming from political developments in Italy and several EMEs, weighed on prices of foreign risk assets. These develop- ments, together with a still-solid economic outlook for the United States, supported an increase in the broad trade-weighted index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar. The dollar appreciated notably against several EME cur- rencies (primarily those of Argentina, Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil), as the increase in U.S. interest rates since late 2017, along with political developments and other issues, intensified concerns about financial vulnerabilities. EME mutual funds saw slight net outflows, and, on bal- ance, EME sovereign spreads widened and equity prices edged lower. In the AFEs, sovereign spreads in some peripheral European countries widened and European bank shares came under pressure, as investors focused on political developments in Italy. Broad equity indexes in the euro area, with the exception of Italy, ended the period little changed, while those in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan edged higher. Market-based measures of expected policy rates were little changed, on balance, and flight-to-safety flows reportedly contrib- uted to declines in German longer-term sovereign yields. FOMC communications over the intermeeting period— including the May FOMC statement and the May FOMC meeting minutes—elicited only minor reactions in asset markets. Quotes on federal funds futures con- tracts suggested that the probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the June FOMC meeting inched up further to near certainty. Levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 2020 implied by overnight index swap (OIS) rates were little changed on net. Longer-term nominal Treasury yields ended the period largely unchanged despite notable movements during Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ the intermeeting period. Measures of inflation compen- sation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Secu- rities were also little changed on net. Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 5 per- cent, on net, since the May FOMC meeting, boosted in part by the stronger-than-expected May Employment Situation report. Stock prices also appeared to have been buoyed by first-quarter earnings reports that gen- erally beat expectations—particularly for the technology sector, which outperformed the broader market. How- ever, the turbulence abroad and, to a lesser degree, mounting concerns about trade policy weighed on equity prices at times. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 at the one-month horizon—the VIX—was down somewhat, on net, remaining just a couple of per- centage points above the very low levels that prevailed before early February. Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities wid- ened moderately for both investment- and speculative- grade firms. However, these spreads remained low by historical standards. Over the intermeeting period, short-term funding mar- kets stayed generally stable despite still-elevated spreads between rates on some private money market instru- ments and OIS rates of similar maturity. While some of the factors contributing to pressures in short-term fund- ing markets had eased recently, the three-month spread between the London interbank offered rate and the OIS rate remained significantly wider than at the start of the year. Growth of outstanding commercial and industrial loans held by banks appeared to have moderated in May after a strong reading in April. The issuance of institutional leveraged loans was strong in April and May; meanwhile, corporate bond issuance was weak, likely reflecting sea- sonal patterns. Gross issuance of municipal bonds in April and May was solid, as issuance continued to re- cover from the slow pace recorded at the start of the year. Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained accommodative. Even so, the growth of CRE loans held by banks ticked down in April and May. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issu- ance, in general, continued at a robust pace; although is- suance softened somewhat in April, partly reflecting sea- sonal factors, it recovered in May. Spreads on CMBS were little changed over the intermeeting period, remain- ing near their post-crisis lows. Residential mortgage financing conditions remained ac- commodative for most borrowers. For borrowers with low credit scores, conditions stayed tight but continued to ease. Growth in home-purchase mortgages slowed a bit and refinancing activity continued to be muted in re- cent months, with both developments partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in the first few months of 2018, on bal- ance, and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending. Growth in consumer credit slowed a bit in the first quarter, as seasonally adjusted credit card balances were about flat after having surged in the fourth quarter of last year. Financing conditions for consumers with subprime credit scores continued to tighten, likely contributing to a decline in auto loan extensions to such borrowers. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared for the June FOMC meeting, the staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an above-trend pace. Real GDP appeared to be rising at a much faster pace in the second quarter than in the first, and it was forecast to increase at a solid rate in the second half of this year. Over the 2018–20 period, output was projected to rise further above the staff’s estimate of its potential, and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further be- low the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate. Relative to the forecast prepared for the May meeting, the projection for real GDP growth beyond the first half of 2018 was revised down a little in response to a higher assumed path for the exchange value of the dollar. In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat. With real GDP rising a little less, on balance, over the forecast period, the projected decline in the unemploy- ment rate over the next few years was a touch smaller than in the previous forecast. The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation from 2018 to 2020 was not revised materially. Total consumer price inflation over the first half of 2018 appeared to be a little lower than in the previous projection, mainly be- cause of slightly softer incoming data on nonmarket prices, but the forecast for the second half of the year was a little higher, reflecting an upward revision to pro- jected consumer energy prices over the next couple of quarters. The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation Minutes of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ over that period because of a projected decline in con- sumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater ex- pansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected. On the downside, those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy than the staff expected if, for example, the marginal pro- pensities to consume for groups most affected by the tax cuts are lower than the staff had assumed. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The up- side risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections and policy assessments are described in the Summary of Economic Projections, which is an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco- nomic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined. Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had both moved close to 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Participants viewed recent readings on spending, em- ployment, and inflation as suggesting little change, on balance, in their assessments of the economic outlook. Incoming data suggested that GDP growth strengthened in the second quarter of this year, as growth of consumer spending picked up after slowing earlier in the year. Par- ticipants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were supporting above-trend GDP growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial condi- tions, and continued high levels of household and busi- ness confidence. They also generally expected that fur- ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Participants generally viewed the risks to the economic outlook as roughly bal- anced. Participants reported that business fixed investment had continued to expand at a strong pace in recent months, supported in part by substantial investment growth in the energy sector. Higher oil prices were expected to continue to support investment in that sector, and Dis- trict contacts in the industry were generally upbeat, though supply constraints for labor and infrastructure were reportedly limiting expansion plans. By contrast, District reports regarding the construction sector were mixed, although here, too, some contacts reported that supply constraints were acting as a drag on activity. Con- ditions in both the manufacturing and service sectors in several Districts were reportedly strong and were seen as contributing to solid investment gains. However, many District contacts expressed concern about the possible adverse effects of tariffs and other proposed trade re- strictions, both domestically and abroad, on future in- vestment activity; contacts in some Districts indicated that plans for capital spending had been scaled back or postponed as a result of uncertainty over trade policy. Contacts in the steel and aluminum industries expected higher prices as a result of the tariffs on these products but had not planned any new investments to increase ca- pacity. Conditions in the agricultural sector reportedly improved somewhat, but contacts were concerned about the effect of potentially higher tariffs on their exports. that Participants agreed labor market conditions strengthened further over the intermeeting period. Nonfarm payroll employment posted strong gains in re- cent months, averaging more than 200,000 per month this year. The unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent in Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ May, below the estimate of each participant who submit- ted a longer-run projection. Participants pointed to other indicators such as a very high rate of job openings and an elevated quits rate as additional signs that labor market conditions were strong. With economic growth anticipated to remain above trend, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to remain below, or de- cline further below, their estimates of its longer-run nor- mal rate. Several participants, however, suggested that there may be less tightness in the labor market than im- plied by the unemployment rate alone, because there was further scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce. Contacts in several Districts reported difficulties finding qualified workers, and, in some cases, firms were coping with labor shortages by increasing salaries and benefits in order to attract or retain workers. Other business contacts facing labor shortages were responding by in- creasing training for less-qualified workers or by invest- ing in automation. On balance, for the economy overall, recent data on average hourly earnings indicated that wage increases remained moderate. A number of partic- ipants noted that, with the unemployment rate expected to remain below estimates of its longer-run normal rate, they anticipated wage inflation to pick up further. Participants noted that the 12-month changes in both overall and core PCE prices had recently moved close to 2 percent. The recent large increases in consumer en- ergy prices had pushed up total PCE price inflation rel- ative to the core measure, and this divergence was ex- pected to continue in the near term, resulting in a tem- porary increase in overall inflation above the Commit- tee’s 2 percent longer-run objective. In general, partici- pants viewed recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive on a sustained basis, although a number of partici- pants noted that it was premature to conclude that the Committee had achieved that objective. The generally favorable outlook for inflation was buttressed by reports from business contacts in several Districts suggesting some firming of inflationary pressures; for example, many business contacts indicated that they were experi- encing rising input costs, and, in some cases, firms ap- peared to be passing these cost increases through to con- sumer prices. Although core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Fed- eral Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the me- dium term. In light of inflation having run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective for the past several years, a few participants cautioned that measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from financial market data remained somewhat below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Accordingly, in their view, investors appeared to judge the expected path of inflation as running a bit below 2 percent over the medium run. Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflation- ary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn. Participants commented on a number of risks and un- certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending. Participants generally continued to see recent fiscal policy changes as supportive of eco- nomic growth over the next few years, and a few indi- cated that fiscal policy posed an upside risk. A few par- ticipants raised the concern that fiscal policy is not cur- rently on a sustainable path. Many participants saw po- tential downside risks to economic growth and inflation associated with political and economic developments in Europe and some EMEs. Meeting participants also discussed the term structure of interest rates and what a flattening of the yield curve might signal about economic activity going forward. Participants pointed to a number of factors, other than the gradual rise of the federal funds rate, that could con- tribute to a reduction in the spread between long-term and short-term Treasury yields, including a reduction in investors’ estimates of the longer-run neutral real inter- est rate; lower longer-term inflation expectations; or a lower level of term premiums in recent years relative to historical experience reflecting, in part, central bank as- set purchases. Some participants noted that such factors might temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity; how- ever, several others expressed doubt about whether such factors were distorting the information content of the yield curve. A number of participants thought it would be important to continue to monitor the slope of the yield curve, given the historical regularity that an in- verted yield curve has indicated an increased risk of re- cession in the United States. Participants also discussed Minutes of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ a staff presentation of an indicator of the likelihood of recession based on the spread between the current level of the federal funds rate and the expected federal funds rate several quarters ahead derived from futures market prices. The staff noted that this measure may be less affected by many of the factors that have contributed to the flattening of the yield curve, such as depressed term premiums at longer horizons. Several participants cau- tioned that yield curve movements should be interpreted within the broader context of financial conditions and the outlook, and would be only one among many con- siderations in forming an assessment of appropriate pol- icy. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally agreed that the economic expan- sion was progressing roughly as anticipated, with real economic activity expanding at a solid rate, labor market conditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s objective. Based on their current as- sessments, almost all participants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to con- tinue its gradual approach to policy firming by raising the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. These participants agreed that, even after such an increase in the target range, the stance of mon- etary policy would remain accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. One participant remarked that, with inflation having run consistently below 2 percent in re- cent years and market-based measures of inflation com- pensation still low, postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push infla- tion expectations up to levels consistent with the Com- mittee’s objective. With regard to the medium-term outlook for monetary policy, participants generally judged that, with the econ- omy already very strong and inflation expected to run at 2 percent on a sustained basis over the medium term, it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that was at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer- run level by 2019 or 2020. Participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook relative to the Commit- tee’s statutory objectives. Participants pointed to various reasons for raising short- term interest rates gradually, including the uncertainty surrounding the level of the federal funds rate in the longer run, the lags with which changes in monetary pol- icy affect the economy, and the potential constraints on adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate in response to adverse shocks when short-term interest rates are low. In addition, a few participants saw survey- or market-based indicators as suggesting that inflation expectations were not yet firmly anchored at a level con- sistent with the Committee’s objective. A few also noted that a temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent could be helpful in anchoring longer-run infla- tion expectations at a level consistent with the Commit- tee’s symmetric objective. Participants offered their views about how much addi- tional policy firming would likely be required to sustain- ably achieve the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. Many noted that, if gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate continued, the federal funds rate could be at or above their estimates of its neutral level sometime next year. In that regard, participants discussed how the Committee’s communications might evolve over com- ing meetings if the economy progressed about as antici- pated; in particular, a number of them noted that it might soon be appropriate to modify the language in the postmeeting statement indicating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” Participants supported a plan to implement a technical adjustment to the IOER rate that would place it at a level 5 basis points below the top of the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate. A few participants suggested that, before too long, the Committee might want to fur- ther discuss how it can implement monetary policy most effectively and efficiently when the quantity of reserve balances reaches a level appreciably below that seen re- cently. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in May indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a solid rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined. Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had moved close to 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expecta- tions were little changed, on balance. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Members viewed the recent data as consistent with a strong economy that was evolving about as they had ex- pected. They judged that continuing along a path of gradual policy firming would balance the risk of moving too quickly, which could leave inflation short of a sus- tained return to the Committee’s symmetric goal, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could lead to a buildup of inflation pressures or material financial im- balances. Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Members continued to judge that the risks to the economic outlook remained roughly balanced. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent. They indicated that the stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sus- tained return to 2 percent inflation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend upon their assessment of realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment objective and symmetric 2 per- cent inflation objective. They reiterated that this assess- ment would take into account a wide range of infor- mation, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expecta- tions, and readings on financial and international devel- opments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members fa- vored the removal of the forward-guidance language stating that “the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.” Members noted that, although this forward-guidance language had been useful for com- municating the expected path of the federal funds rate during the early stages of policy normalization, this lan- guage was no longer appropriate in light of the strong state of the economy and the current expected path for policy. Moreover, the removal of the forward-guidance language and other changes to the statement should streamline and facilitate the Committee’s communica- tions. Importantly, the changes were a reflection of the progress toward achieving the Committee’s statutory goals and did not reflect a shift in the approach to policy going forward. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe- cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective June 14, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1¾ to 2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol- iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer- ing rate of 1.75 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per- counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during June that exceeds $18 billion, and to continue reinvesting the in agency mortgage-backed securities amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during June that exceeds $12 billion. Effective in July, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury se- curities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $24 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Re- serve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $16 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” Minutes of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains have been strong, on aver- age, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined. Recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Risks to the eco- nomic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1¾ to 2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market condi- tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla- tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, William C. Dudley, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Loretta J. Mester, Randal K. Quarles, and John C. Williams. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1.95 percent, effective June 14, 2018. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point increase in the primary credit rate (discount rate) to 2½ percent, effective June 14, 2018.4 Election of Committee Vice Chairman By unanimous vote, the Committee selected John C. Williams to serve as Vice Chairman, effective on June 18, 2018, until the selection of a successor at the Committee’s first regularly scheduled meeting in 2019. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 31– August 1, 2018. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on June 13, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on May 22, 2018, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on May 1-2, 2018. _____________________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 4 In taking this action, the Board approved requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Fran- cisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2½ percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Bank, effective on the later of June 14, 2018, and the date such Reserve Bank informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Sec- retary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 2½ percent, effective June 14, 2018.) The second vote of the Board also encompassed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on June 12–13, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run.1 Each participant’s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy—includ- ing a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to af- fect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the ab- sence of further shocks to the economy.2 “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster out- comes for economic activity and inflation that best sat- isfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that, in 2018, real GDP would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run growth rate of real GDP. Participants generally saw real GDP growth moderating somewhat in each of the fol- lowing two years but remaining above their estimates of the longer-run rate. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that, throughout the projection period, the unemployment rate would run be- low their estimates of its longer-run level. All partici- pants projected that inflation, as measured by the four- quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would run at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective by the end of 2018 and remain roughly flat through 2020. Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from March, most participants slightly marked up their projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and some- what lowered their projections for the unemployment rate from 2018 through 2020; participants indicated that these revisions reflected, in large part, strength in incom- ing data. A large majority of participants made slight up- ward adjustments to their projections of inflation in 2018. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent in- flation would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. The central tendencies of partic- ipants’ projections of the federal funds rate for both 2018 and 2019 were roughly unchanged, but the medians for both years were 25 basis points higher relative to March. Nearly all participants who submitted longer- run projections expected that, during part of the projec- tion period, evolving economic conditions would make it appropriate for the federal funds rate to move some- what above their estimates of its longer-run level. In general, participants continued to view the uncer- tainty attached to their economic projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years. As in March, most participants judged the risks around their projec- tions for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation to be broadly balanced. The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess- ments of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.8 percent for this year and 2.4 percent for next year. The median was 2.0 percent for 2020, a touch above the median pro- jection of longer-run growth. Most participants contin- ued to cite fiscal policy as a driver of strong economic activity over the next couple of years. Many participants also mentioned accommodative monetary policy and fi- nancial conditions, strength in the global outlook, con- tinued momentum in the labor market, or positive read- ings on business and consumer sentiment as important factors shaping the economic outlook. Compared with the March SEP, the median of participants’ projections for the rate of real GDP growth was 0.1 percentage point higher for this year and unchanged for the next two years. Almost all participants expected the unemployment rate to decline somewhat further over the projection period. The median of participants’ projections for the unem- ployment rate was 3.6 percent for the final quarter of this year and 3.5 percent for the final quarters of 2019 1 Three members of the Board of Governors were in office at the time of the June 2018 meeting. 2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.

Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ and 2020. The median of participants’ estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run. The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth this year shifted up noticeably from that in the March SEP. By contrast, the distributions of pro- jected real GDP growth in 2019 and 2020 and over the longer run were little changed. The distributions of in- dividual projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 to 2020 shifted down relative to the distributions in March, while the downward shift in the distribution of longer-run projections was very modest. The Outlook for Inflation The medians of participants’ projections for total and core PCE price inflation in 2018 were 2.1 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, and the median for each meas- ure was 2.1 percent in 2019 and 2020. Compared with the March SEP, the medians of participants’ projections for total PCE price inflation for this year and next were revised up slightly. Some participants pointed to incom- ing data on energy prices as a reason for their upward revisions. The median of participants’ forecasts for core PCE price inflation was up a touch for this year and un- changed for subsequent years. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri- butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in- flation. The distributions of both total and core PCE price inflation for 2018 shifted to the right relative to the distributions in March. The distributions of projected inflation in 2019, 2020, and over the longer run were roughly unchanged. Participants generally expected each measure to be at or slightly above 2 percent in 2019 and 2020. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E provides the distribution of participants’ judgments regarding the appropriate target—or mid- point of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2018 to 2020 and over the longer run. The distributions of projected policy rates through 2020 shifted modestly higher, consistent with the revisions to participants’ projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. As in their March projections, a large majority of participants anticipated that evolving economic conditions would likely warrant the equivalent of a total of either three or four increases of 25 basis points in the target range for the federal funds rate over 2018. There was a slight re- duction in the dispersion of participants’ views, with no participant regarding the appropriate target at the end of the year to be below 1.88 percent. For each subsequent year, the dispersion of participants’ year-end projections was somewhat smaller than that in the March SEP. The medians of participants’ projections of the federal funds rate rose gradually to 2.4 percent at the end of this year, 3.1 percent at the end of 2019, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2020. The median of participants’ longer-run estimates, at 2.9 percent, was unchanged relative to the March SEP. In discussing their projections, many participants con- tinued to express the view that the appropriate trajectory of the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely involve gradual increases. This view was predi- cated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path of policy firming likely would appropriately balance the risks associated with, among other consider- ations, the possibilities that U.S. fiscal policy could have larger or more persistent positive effects on real activity and that shifts in trade policy or developments abroad could weigh on the expansion. As always, the appropri- ate path of the federal funds rate would depend on evolving economic conditions and their implications for participants’ economic outlooks and assessments of risks. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the path for the federal funds rate that, in their view, is likely to be appropriate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic out- comes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the poten- tial benefits and costs should they occur. As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty, based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years, for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts display the median SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confi- dence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the degree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these varia- bles would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer- tainty attached to their economic projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years, a view that was essentially unchanged from March.3 Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec- tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Most participants judged the risks to their projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, total inflation, and core inflation as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart. Compared with March, even more participants saw the risks to their projections as broadly balanced. Specifically, for GDP growth, only one participant viewed the risks as tilted to the downside, and the number of participants who viewed the risks as tilted to the upside dropped from four to two. For the unemployment rate, the number of participants who saw the risks as tilted toward low readings dropped from four to two. For inflation, all but one participant judged the risks to either total or core PCE price inflation as broadly balanced. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their projections, several participants continued to point to fiscal developments as a source of upside risk, many par- ticipants cited developments related to trade policy as posing downside risks to their growth forecasts, and a few participants also pointed to political developments in Europe or the global outlook more generally as down- side-risk factors. A few participants noted that the ap- preciation of the dollar posed downside risks to the in- flation outlook. A few participants also noted the risk of inflation moving higher than anticipated as the unem- ployment rate falls. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate were also subject to considera- ble uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the fed- eral funds rate in response to actual and prospective de- velopments over time in real GDP growth, the unem- ployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re- flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco- nomic variables. Figure 5 provides a graphical represen- tation of this uncertainty, plotting the median SEP pro- jection for the federal funds rate surrounded by confi- dence intervals derived from the results presented in ta- ble 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, forecast uncertainty surrounding the appropriate path of the fed- eral funds rate is substantial and increases for longer ho- rizons. 3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of June 12–13, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.7 to 4.3 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence inter- vals for overall inflation would be 1.3 to 2.7 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second and third years. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projec- tion might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmet- rically positioned around the median projection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.

This toolkit included threshold-based forward-guidance policies, in which the Committee communicates that the federal funds rate will remain at the ELB until either inflation or the unemployment rate reaches a certain threshold, and balance sheet policies, involving increases in the size or duration of the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings. The staff’s analysis indicated that under various policy rules, including those prescribing aggressive reductions in the federal funds rate in response to adverse economic shocks, there was a meaningful risk that the ELB could bind sometime during the next decade. That analysis also implied that threshold-based forward guidance and balance sheet actions could provide additional accom- modation that could help support economic activity and mitigate disinflationary pressures in these episodes. In the model simulations, because of unanticipated shocks and lags in the transmission of the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation, the ef- fectiveness of monetary policy in general, including for- ward-guidance and balance sheet policies, was limited in mitigating the initial downturn in the economy. The staff noted that there was considerable uncertainty sur- rounding the estimated effects of those policies on the economy; in addition, estimates of how frequently the 3 Attended Tuesday session only. 4 Attended through the discussion of monetary policy options at the effective lower bound. 5 In the analysis, the staff assumed that the ELB was 12.5 basis points, equal to the midpoint of the target range for the federal funds rate from December 2008 to December 2015. Page 2 _Federal Open Market Committee ELB could bind in the future differed across the models that the staff examined. In the discussion that followed the staff’s briefing, par- ticipants generally agreed that their current toolkit could provide significant accommodation but expressed con- cern about the potential limits on policy effectiveness stemming from the ELB. They viewed it as a matter of prudent planning to evaluate potential policy options in advance of such ELB events. Many participants com- mented on the monetary policy implications of the ap- parent secular decline in neutral real interest rates. That decline was viewed as likely driven by various factors, including slower trend growth of the labor force and productivity as well as increased demand for safe assets. In such circumstances, those participants saw monetary policy as having less scope than in the past to reduce the federal funds rate in response to negative shocks. Ac- cordingly, in their view, spells at the ELB could become more frequent and protracted than in the past, con- sistent with the staff’s analysis. Moreover, the secular decline in interest rates was a global phenomenon, and a couple of participants emphasized that this decline in- creased the likelihood that the ELB could bind simulta- neously in a number of countries. A few other partici- pants raised the concern that frequent or extended ELB episodes could result in expectations for inflation that were below the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive, further limiting the scope for reductions in the fed- eral funds rate to serve as a buffer for the economy and increasing the likelihood of ELB episodes. Fiscal policy was viewed as a potentially important tool in addressing a future economic downturn in which monetary policy was constrained by the ELB; however, countercyclical fiscal policy actions in the United States may be con- strained by the high and rising level of federal govern- ment debt. A couple of participants saw macropruden- tial and regulatory policies as tools that could be used to mitigate the risk of financial imbalances inducing an eco- nomic downturn in which the ELB constrained the fed- eral funds rate. Participants generally agreed that both forward guidance and balance sheet actions would be effective tools to use if the federal funds rate were to become constrained by the ELB. In the Addendum to the Policy Normaliza- tion Principles and Plans statement issued in June 2017, the Committee indicated that it would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate. However, participants acknowl- edged that there may be limits to the effectiveness of these tools in addressing an ELB episode. They also em- phasized that there was considerable uncertainty about the economic effects of these tools. Consistent with that view, a few participants noted that economic researchers had not yet reached a consensus about the effectiveness of unconventional policies. A number of participants indicated that there might be significant costs associated with the use of unconventional policies, and that these costs might limit, in particular, the extent to which the Committee should engage in large-scale asset purchases. Participants discussed the prominent role that previous communications about forward guidance and balance sheet actions, in conjunction with those policy measures, had in shaping public expectations about the potential future use of these tools and in determining their effec- tiveness. In general, advance communications about these policies were seen as important in reinforcing pub- lic understanding of the Committee’s commitment to achieving its dual-mandate objectives. However, several participants cautioned against being too specific about how the Committee would deploy such tools. In partic- ular, it was difficult to anticipate the forces that might push the economy into a recession, and thus preserving some flexibility in responding to an economic downturn could be appropriate. Moreover, although making mul- tiyear commitments regarding asset purchases or the fu- ture path of the federal funds rate could enhance the ef- fectiveness of these policies, such commitments could unduly constrain the choices of the Committee in the future. While the Committee’s current toolkit was judged to be effective, participants agreed, as a matter of prudent planning, to discuss their policy options further and to broaden the discussion to include the evaluation of po- tential alternative policy strategies for addressing the ELB. Building on their discussions at previous meet- ings, participants suggested that a number of possible al- ternatives might be worth consideration and agreed to return to this topic at future meetings. Several partici- pants indicated that it would be desirable to hold peri- odic and systematic reviews in which the Committee as- sessed the strengths and weaknesses of its current mon- etary policy framework. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) provided a summary of developments in do- Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_ Page 3 by policy recent announcements mestic and global financial markets over the intermeet- ing period. Asset prices were influenced by a number of factors, including reports concerning trade tensions among the United States and its major trading partners, foreign monetary policy developments, and data point- ing to strong growth momentum in the United States. Escalating trade tensions between China and the United States prompted notable market moves, particularly in foreign exchange markets. News on an agreement be- tween the United States and the European Union to con- tinue talks to resolve their trade disputes provided some support for global equity prices. The manager summa- the rized European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ). European yields moved lower following a revi- sion of the ECB’s forward guidance at its June meeting concerning asset purchases and the path of short-term rates. The Japanese yield curve steepened following re- ports that the BOJ may facilitate an increase in longer- term interest rates. At its July meeting, the BOJ an- nounced a number of changes with respect to forward guidance on its policy outlook, including its intention to keep interest rates low for an extended period. Mean- while, expectations concerning the path of monetary policy in the United States were little changed over the intermeeting period. Futures quotes indicated that mar- ket participants placed high odds on a further quarter- point firming in the federal funds rate at the September FOMC meeting. Responses to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Partic- ipants indicated that concerns about trade tensions had not affected the outlook for U.S. monetary policy. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of money markets and open market operations. Money market rates had moved up in line with the 20 basis point increase in the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate at the June meeting. Over the days following the June FOMC meeting, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) moved up relative to the IOER rate, reportedly reflect- ing some special factors in the federal funds market, in- cluding increased demand for overnight funding by banks in connection with liquidity regulations and a pull- back by Federal Home Loan Banks in their lending in the federal funds market. These developments proved temporary, and the EFFR subsequently returned to a level about 4 basis points below the IOER rate. The deputy manager also discussed the Desk’s plans for small-value purchases of agency mortgage-backed secu- rities (MBS). The staff projected that principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency MBS would fall below the FOMC’s monthly redemption cap beginning in October. If principal payments followed this anticipated trajectory, the Desk planned to begin conducting monthly small-value purchases of agency MBS at that time to maintain operational readiness. The deputy manager also discussed the Federal Housing Fi- nance Agency’s Single Security Initiative, under which Uniform Mortgage-Backed Securities (UMBS) would be issued by both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac beginning in June 2019. The Desk planned to develop the capabil- ity to conduct UMBS transactions and, to more effi- ciently manage the portfolio, convert some portion of the SOMA’s existing agency MBS holdings to UMBS where appropriate. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the July 31–August 1 meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin- ued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong rate in the first half of the year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), re- mained near 2 percent in June. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a strong pace again in June. The national unemployment rate moved up to 4.0 percent, but the labor force participa- tion rate rose by a similar amount, leaving the employ- ment-to-population ratio unchanged from May. The three-month moving averages of the unemployment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics were each at or below the lows achieved during the previous expansion. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged down to its lowest level since late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings ticked down in May but remained elevated, while the rate of quits moved higher; initial claims for unemployment in- surance benefits continued to be low through mid-July. Recent readings showed that increases in hourly labor compensation stepped up modestly over the past year. The employment cost index for private workers in- creased 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in June (compared with 2.4 percent over the same 12 months a year earlier), and average hourly earnings for all employ- ees rose 2.7 percent over that period (compared with Page 4 _Federal Open Market Committee 2.5 percent over the same 12 months a year earlier). (Data on compensation per hour that reflected the com- prehensive revision of the national income and product accounts by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) were not available at the time of the meeting.) Total industrial production was little changed, on net, from April to June despite solid increases in the output of the mining sector. Over the first half of the year, manufacturing production rose at a modest pace. Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested a sizable in- crease in light motor vehicle production in the third quarter, and broader indicators of manufacturing pro- duction, such as the new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to solid gains in factory output in the near term. Real PCE rose briskly in the second quarter after a mod- est gain in the first quarter. Light motor vehicle sales maintained a robust pace in June, and indicators of ve- hicle demand were mixed but generally favorable. More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spending—including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—continued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Consumer sentiment, as meas- ured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consum- ers, remained upbeat in June and July. Residential investment declined again in the second quarter. Starts for new single-family homes were little changed, on average, in May and June, but starts of mul- tifamily units declined on net. The issuance of building permits for both types of housing was lower in the sec- ond quarter than in the first quarter, which suggested that starts might move lower in coming months. Sales of existing homes edged down in May and June, while sales of new homes moved up on balance. Real private expenditures for business equipment and in- tellectual property rose at a moderate pace in the second quarter after a strong gain in the first quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding air- craft rose in May and June, and forward-looking indica- tors of business equipment spending—such as the back- log of unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and re- gional surveys—continued to point to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term. Real business ex- penditures for nonresidential structures expanded at a solid pace again in the second quarter. However, the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation— an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—decreased slightly in recent weeks. Total real government purchases rose at a faster rate in the second quarter than in the first. Real federal defense and nondefense purchases both increased in the second quarter. Real purchases by state and local governments also moved higher; state and local government payrolls and construction spending by those governments in- creased in the second quarter. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as exports, led by agricultural products (particularly soybeans) and capital goods, increased strongly and im- ports increased only modestly. In June, however, ad- vance data suggested that nominal goods exports fell and imports rose. All told, the BEA estimates that net ex- ports made a positive contribution of about 1 percentage point to real GDP growth in the second quarter after a near-zero contribution in the first. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in June. Core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.9 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in June, while core CPI inflation was 2.3 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run infla- tion expectations—including those from the Michigan survey and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Incoming data suggested that foreign economic activity expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter. Monthly indicators pointed to a pickup in the pace of economic activity in most advanced foreign economies (AFEs) following a temporary dip in the first quarter. However, real GDP growth remained moderate in the euro area and appeared to have slowed notably in many emerging market economies (EMEs), especially Mexico, from an unusually strong start to the year. Foreign in- flation fell in the second quarter, largely reflecting lower retail energy and food price inflation. Underlying infla- tion pressures in most foreign economies, especially in some AFEs, remained subdued. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Concerns regarding international trade policy weighed on market sentiment at times over the intermeeting pe- riod, prompting notable declines in some foreign equity markets but leaving only a modest imprint on domestic asset prices on net. Meanwhile, FOMC communications Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_ Page 5 were viewed by market participants as slightly less ac- commodative than expected, and domestic economic data releases were seen as mixed. On balance, market- based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate through the end of 2019 edged up slightly. Yields on medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury securi- ties were little changed. The broad dollar index moved up. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activ- ity on balance. Although the reactions of asset prices to FOMC com- munications during the period were generally modest, market participants reportedly interpreted the June FOMC statement and Summary of Economic Projec- tions (SEP) as somewhat less accommodative than ex- pected. The probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the August FOMC meeting, as implied by quotes on federal funds futures contracts, remained close to zero; the probability of an increase at the September FOMC meeting rose to about 90 percent by the end of the intermeeting period. Levels of the federal funds rate at the end of 2019 and 2020 implied by overnight index swap (OIS) rates edged up slightly on net. The nominal Treasury yield curve flattened somewhat during the intermeeting period. Measures of inflation compensation derived Inflation- Protected Securities were little changed on net. from Treasury Concerns about international trade disputes led to a slight decline in sentiment toward some domestic risky assets early in the period, but sentiment was buoyed later by positive corporate earnings releases for the second quarter. Broad U.S. equity price indexes displayed mixed results since the June FOMC meeting. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month hori- zon—the VIX—was little changed, on net, and re- mained only a bit above the very low levels that prevailed before early February. Over the intermeeting period, spreads of yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds over those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities were little changed, on net, for both investment- and specula- tive-grade firms. These spreads remained low by histor- ical standards. Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly, and spreads of unsecured rates over comparable-maturity OIS rates continued to narrow during the intermeeting period. After the June FOMC meeting, the EFFR rose around 20 basis points, in line with the increase in the IOER rate, and traded well within the target range throughout the period. The dollar appreciated against most currencies, with the notable exception of the Mexican peso, which appreci- ated on some easing of investor concerns around pro- spective economic policies of the newly elected govern- ment. Escalating trade tensions contributed to an unu- sually sharp depreciation of the Chinese renminbi. Trade tensions also drove foreign equity prices lower, but there was a modest reversal late in the intermeeting period following an agreement between the United States and the European Union to hold off on tariff in- creases pending further negotiations. On net, equity prices were little changed in the AFEs, while they de- clined in the EMEs, led largely by a steep drop in China. Outflows from dedicated emerging market funds slowed, and EME sovereign bond spreads narrowed slightly. On balance, longer-term bond yields in the AFEs de- clined slightly over the intermeeting period. ECB com- munications following its June meeting were perceived as more accommodative than expected and led to a no- ticeable decline in market-based measures of policy rate expectations. The BOJ issued revised forward guidance at its July meeting indicating that it intends to maintain current low short- and long-term interest rates for an ex- tended period. Finally, the Bank of England held its pol- icy rate steady at its June meeting, but U.K. yields de- clined slightly amid ongoing Brexit-related concerns as well as lower-than-expected inflation data. Financing conditions for nonfinancial corporations con- tinued to be favorable over the intermeeting period. Gross issuance of corporate bonds and institutional lev- eraged loans picked up in May and stayed strong in June, with the rise in corporate bond issuance concentrated in the investment-grade segment of the market. Mean- while, the volume of equity issuance remained robust. Growth of outstanding commercial and industrial (C&I) loans held by banks was strong, on average, in June. Re- spondents to the June Senior Loan Officer Opinion Sur- vey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) reported that their institutions had eased standards and terms on C&I loans in the second quarter, most often citing increased competition from other lenders and increased ease of transacting in the secondary market as the reasons for doing so. Although some signs of deterioration emerged over the intermeeting period, the credit quality of nonfi- nancial corporations continued to be solid overall. The ratio of aggregate debt to assets in this sector stayed near multidecade highs. Gross issuance of municipal bonds in June was robust, continuing to increase from its slow start to the year. Page 6 _Federal Open Market Committee Financing conditions for commercial real estate (CRE) remained accommodative. CRE loans at banks main- tained solid growth over the past several quarters, with growth shared across all three major CRE loan catego- ries. On a weighted basis across all major CRE loan cat- egories, respondents to the June SLOOS reported that standards and demand for CRE loans continued to be unchanged, on the whole, over the second quarter. In- terest rate spreads on commercial mortgage-backed se- curities (CMBS) were little changed over the intermeet- ing period and remained near their post-crisis lows, while issuance of non-agency and agency CMBS main- tained a solid pace in the second quarter. Most borrowers in the residential mortgage market con- tinued to face accommodative financing conditions. For borrowers with low credit scores, credit conditions con- tinued to ease but stayed tight overall. Growth in home- purchase mortgages slowed a bit, and refinancing activ- ity continued to be muted over the past year, with both developments partly reflecting the rise in mortgage rates earlier this year. Relative to the June FOMC meeting, interest rates on 30-year conforming mortgages and yields on agency MBS were little changed. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed so far this year, on balance, and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending. Growth in consumer credit picked up in May from the more moderate pace seen earlier this year. Despite rising interest rates, financing rates remained low compared with historical levels, and recent household surveys indi- cated that consumers’ assessments of buying conditions for autos and other expensive durable goods were gen- erally positive. Credit supply conditions also continued to be largely supportive of spending. A moderate net fraction of July SLOOS respondents reported easing standards on auto loans over the previous three months after several quarters in which banks had reported tight- ening standards. However, a significant net fraction of banks reportedly continued to tighten standards for credit card accounts. The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability; the report again characterized the fi- nancial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. This overall assessment incorpo- rated the staff’s judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures continued to be elevated, with no major asset class exhibiting valuations below their historical midpoints. Additionally, the staff judged vulnerabilities from financial-sector leverage and ma- turity and liquidity transformation to be low, vulnerabil- ities from household leverage as being in the low-to- moderate range, and vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as elevated. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared for this FOMC meeting, the staff continued to project that the economy would expand at an above-trend pace. Real GDP was forecast to increase in the second half of this year at a pace that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year. Over the 2018–20 period, output was projected to rise further above the staff’s estimate of potential out- put, and the unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of the longer-run nat- ural rate. However, with labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to assume that the projected decline in the unemployment rate will be attenuated by a greater-than-usual cyclical improvement in the labor force participation rate. Relative to the forecast pre- pared for the June meeting, the projection for real GDP growth was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger incoming data on household spending. In ad- dition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply con- straints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term. The unemployment rate was projected to be a little higher over the next few quarters than in the previous forecast, but it was essentially unrevised there- after. The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised down a little, mainly because of a slower- than-expected increase in consumer energy prices in the second quarter and a downward revision to the forecast for energy price inflation in the second half of this year. The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer en- ergy prices in 2019 and 2020. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, household spending and business investment could ex- pand faster over the next few years than the staff pro- jected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the downside, trade policies could move in a direc- tion that would have significant negative effects on eco- nomic growth. Another possibility was that recent fiscal Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_ Page 7 policy actions could produce less of a boost to aggregate demand than assumed in the baseline projection, as the current tightness of resource utilization may result in smaller multiplier effects than would be typical at other points in the business cycle. Risks to the inflation pro- jection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an econ- omy that was projected to move further above its poten- tial was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in June indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that eco- nomic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had stayed low. Household spend- ing and business fixed investment had grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core in- flation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Participants generally noted that economic growth in the second quarter had been strong; incoming data indicated considerable momentum in spending by households and businesses. Several participants stressed the possibility that real GDP growth in the second quarter may have been boosted by transitory factors, including an outsized increase in U.S. exports. For the second half of the year, participants generally expected that GDP growth would likely slow from its second-quarter rate but would still exceed that of potential output. Participants noted a number of favorable economic factors that were sup- porting above-trend GDP growth; these included a strong labor market, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, accommodative financial conditions, and con- tinued high levels of household and business confidence. Participants generally viewed the risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced. Reports from business contacts confirmed a robust pace of expansion in several sectors of the economy, includ- ing energy, manufacturing, and services. Crude oil pro- duction was reported as having grown rapidly. In con- trast to other sectors, residential construction activity ap- peared to have softened somewhat, possibly reflecting declining home affordability, higher mortgage rates, scarcity of available lots in certain cities, and delays in building approvals. However, a couple of participants reported vibrancy in industrial and multifamily construc- tion activity. Business contacts in various sectors had cited labor shortages and other supply constraints as im- pediments to production. Furthermore, recent tariff in- creases had put upward pressure on input prices. Busi- ness contacts in a few Districts reported that uncertainty regarding trade policy had led to some reductions or de- lays in their investment spending. Nonetheless, a num- ber of participants indicated that most businesses con- cerned about trade disputes had not yet cut back their capital expenditures or hiring but might do so if trade tensions were not resolved soon. Several participants observed that the agricultural sector had been adversely affected by significant declines in crop and livestock prices over the intermeeting period. A couple of partic- ipants noted that this development likely partly flowed from trade tensions. Participants agreed that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period. Pay- rolls had grown strongly in June, and labor market tight- ness was reflected in recent readings on rates of private- sector job openings and quits and on job-to-job switch- ing by workers. Although the unemployment rate in- creased slightly in June, this increase was accompanied by an uptick in the labor force participation rate. Many participants commented on the fact that measures of aggregate nominal wage growth had so far picked up only modestly. Among the factors cited as containing the pickup in wage growth were low trend productivity growth, lags in the response of nominal wage growth to resource pressures, and improvements in the terms of employment that were not recorded in the wage data. Alternatively, the recent pace of nominal wage growth might indicate continued slack in the labor market. However, some participants expected a pickup in aggre- gate nominal wage growth to occur before long, with a number of participants reporting that wage pressures in their Districts were rising or that firms now exhibited greater willingness to grant wage increases. Participants noted that both overall inflation and infla- tion for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. A few participants ex- pressed increased confidence that the recent return of inflation to near the Committee’s longer-term 2 percent objective would be sustained. Several participants com- mented that increases in the prices of particular goods, such as those induced by the tariff increases, would likely Page 8 _Federal Open Market Committee be one source of short-term upward pressure on the in- flation rate, although offsetting influences—including the negative effects that trade developments were having on agricultural prices—were also noted. Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses. Many participants anticipated that, over the medium term, high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep inflation near 2 percent. However, some participants observed that inflation in recent years had shown only a weak connection to measures of resource pressures or indicated that they would like to see further evidence that measures of underlying inflation or readings on in- flation expectations were on course to attain levels con- sistent with sustained achievement of the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Although a few participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of inflation calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dal- las was still below 2 percent, a couple noted forecasts that this measure would reach 2 percent by the end of the year. Some participants raised the concern that a prolonged period in which the economy operated be- yond potential could give rise to inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could eventually trigger an economic downturn. Participants commented on a number of risks and un- certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. They generally continued to see fiscal policy and the strengthening of the labor market as supportive of economic growth in the near term. Some noted larger or more persistent positive effects of these factors as an upside risk to the outlook. A few participants indicated, however, that a faster-than-expected fading of the fiscal impetus or a greater-than-anticipated subsequent fiscal tightening constituted a downside risk. In addition, all participants pointed to ongoing trade disagreements and proposed trade measures as an important source of un- certainty and risks. Participants observed that if a large- scale and prolonged dispute over trade policies devel- oped, there would likely be adverse effects on business investment spending, and employment. sentiment, Moreover, wide-ranging tariff increases would also re- duce the purchasing power of U.S. households. Further negative effects in such a scenario could include reduc- tions in productivity and disruptions of supply chains. Other downside risks cited included the possibility of a significant weakening in the housing sector, a sharp in- crease in oil prices, or a severe slowdown in EMEs. Participants remarked on the extent to which financial conditions remained supportive of economic expansion. Over the intermeeting period, only a small change in overall financial conditions occurred, with modest movements on net in equity prices and in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. The yield curve had flat- tened further over the intermeeting period. Participants who commented on financial stability noted that asset valuations remained elevated and corporate borrowing terms remained easy. They also noted that regulatory changes introduced in the past decade had helped to reduce the susceptibility of the financial sector to runs and to strengthen the capital positions of banks and other financial institutions. In discussing the capital positions of large banks, a few participants emphasized that financial stability risks could be reduced if these in- stitutions further boosted their capital cushions while their profits are strong and the economic outlook is fa- vorable; arguments for and against the activation of the countercyclical capital buffer as a means of further strengthening the capital positions of large banks were discussed in this context. In their consideration of monetary policy, participants discussed the implications of recent economic and finan- cial developments for the economic outlook and the as- sociated risks to that outlook. Participants remarked on recent above-trend growth in real GDP and on indica- tors of resource utilization. Some commented that con- sumer spending had been quite strong in the second quarter, confirming their impressions that the first-quar- ter weakness had been temporary. Several participants also pointed to the continued strength in business fixed investment, although the persistent weakness and the risk of a further slowdown in residential investment were also noted. A few participants suggested there could still be some labor market slack, citing recent increases in la- bor force participation rates relative to prevailing demo- graphically driven downward trends; the participation rate of prime-age men, in particular, was still below its previous business cycle peak. Other participants judged that labor market conditions were tight, pointing to other data, including job quits and openings rates, and anecdotes from contacts. Participants generally characterized inflation as running close to the Committee’s objective of 2 percent, and most of those who expressed a view indicated that recent readings on inflation had come in close to their expecta- tions. Consistent with their SEP submissions in June, Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_ Page 9 several participants remarked that inflation, measured on a 12-month basis, was likely to move modestly above the Committee’s objective for a time. Others pointed to some indicators suggesting that long-term inflation ex- pectations could be below levels consistent with the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective. Participants generally judged that the current stance of monetary policy remained accommodative, supporting strong labor market conditions and inflation of around 2 percent. Participants agreed that it would be appropri- ate for the Committee to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting. With regard to the medium term, various participants in- dicated that information gathered since the Committee met in June had not significantly altered their outlook for the U.S. economy. Many participants suggested that if incoming data continued to support their current eco- nomic outlook, it would likely soon be appropriate to take another step in removing policy accommodation. Participants generally expected that further gradual in- creases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with a sustained expansion of eco- nomic activity, strong labor market conditions, and in- flation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive over the medium term. Many participants reiterated that the actual path for the federal funds rate would ulti- mately depend on the incoming data and on how those data affect the economic outlook. Participants discussed the economic forces and risks they saw as providing the rationale for gradual increases in the federal funds rate as well as scenarios that might cause them to depart from this expected path. Among other factors, they pointed to uncertainty about the ap- propriate level of the federal funds rate over the longer run and to constraints on the provision of monetary ac- commodation during ELB episodes as reasons for pro- ceeding gradually in the removal of accommodation. Some participants noted that stronger underlying mo- mentum in the economy was an upside risk; most ex- pressed the view that an escalation in international trade disputes was a potentially consequential downside risk for real activity. Some participants suggested that, in the event of a major escalation in trade disputes, the com- plex nature of trade issues, including the entire range of their effects on output and inflation, presented a chal- lenge in determining the appropriate monetary policy re- sponse. Participants also discussed the possible implications of a flattening in the term structure of market interest rates. Several participants cited statistical evidence for the United States that inversions of the yield curve have of- ten preceded recessions. They suggested that policy- makers should pay close attention to the slope of the yield curve in assessing the economic and policy outlook. Other participants emphasized that inferring economic causality from statistical correlations was not appropri- ate. A number of global factors were seen as contrib- uting to downward pressure on term premiums, includ- ing central bank asset purchase programs and the strong worldwide demand for safe assets. In such an environ- ment, an inversion of the yield curve might not have the significance that the historical record would suggest; the signal to be taken from the yield curve needed to be con- sidered in the context of other economic and financial indicators. A couple of participants commented on issues related to the operating framework for the implementation of monetary policy, including, among other things, the im- plications of changes in financial market regulations for the demand for reserves and for the size and composi- tion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. These par- ticipants judged that it would be important for the Com- mittee to resume its discussion of operating frameworks before too long. The Chairman suggested that the Com- mittee would likely resume a discussion of operating frameworks in the fall. Many participants noted that it would likely be appropri- ate in the not-too-distant future to revise the Commit- tee’s characterization of the stance of monetary policy in its postmeeting statement. They agreed that the state- ment’s language that “the stance of monetary policy re- mains accommodative” would, at some point fairly soon, no longer be appropriate. Participants noted that the federal funds rate was moving closer to the range of estimates of its neutral level. A number of participants emphasized the considerable uncertainty in estimates of the neutral rate of interest, stemming from sources such as fiscal policy and large-scale asset purchase programs. Against this background, continuing to provide an ex- plicit assessment of the federal funds rate relative to its neutral level could convey a false sense of precision. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the FOMC met in June indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate had stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment had grown strongly. On a Page 10 _Federal Open Market Committee 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 per- cent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Policymakers viewed the recent data as indicating that the outlook for the economy was evolving about as they had expected. Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the fed- eral funds rate would be consistent with sustained ex- pansion of economic activity, strong labor market con- ditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. Members continued to judge that the risks to the economic out- look appeared roughly balanced. After assessing the incoming data, current conditions, and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¾ to 2 percent. They noted that the stance of monetary policy remained ac- commodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. Members agreed that the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessments of realized and ex- pected economic conditions relative to the objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. They re- iterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and in- ternational developments. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe- cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective August 2, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to under- take open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1¾ to 2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, hol- iday, or similar trading conventions) at an offer- ing rate of 1.75 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-coun- terparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $24 billion, and to re- invest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $16 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for oper- ational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on av- erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer- term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Risks to the eco- nomic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1¾ to 2 percent. The stance of remains accommodative, monetary policy Minutes of the Meeting of July 31–August 1, 2018_ Page 11 thereby supporting strong labor market condi- tions and a sustained return to 2 percent infla- tion. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Wil- liams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Esther L. George, Loretta J. Mester, and Ran- dal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Ms. George voted as alternate member at this meeting. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 1.95 percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate (discount rate) at the existing level of 2½ percent, effective Au- gust 2, 2018.6 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, September 25– 26, 2018. The meeting adjourned at 9:45 a.m. on Au- gust 1, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on July 3, 2018, the Com- mittee unanimously approved the minutes of the Com- mittee meeting held on June 12–13, 2018. _____________________________ James A.

Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) discussed U.S. and global financial develop- ments. In global markets, strains in emerging market economies (EMEs) contributed to volatility in currency and equity markets over the period. In addition, con- cerns about trade tensions between the United States and China were the focus of a great deal of attention among market participants. Such concerns led the Shanghai Composite index to drop as much as 8 percent at one point over the intermeeting period before recov- ering somewhat. The renminbi, however, was relatively stable, reportedly in part because investors believed that Chinese authorities were prepared to take measures to counter significant renminbi depreciation. Regarding domestic financial markets, the manager noted that U.S. equity markets had posted strong gains, spurred by optimism regarding the U.S. economic out- look and rising corporate earnings. Longer-term Treas- ury yields moved higher, and market-based measures of the expected path of the funds rate edged up. According to the Open Market Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants, a 25 basis point in- crease in the target range for the federal funds rate at the September meeting was widely expected; moreover, in- vestors appeared to be placing high odds on a further quarter-point policy firming at the December meeting. In U.S. money markets, the spread between the three- month London interbank offered rate and three-month overnight index swap (OIS) rates continued to narrow. The widening in that spread earlier in the year appeared to reflect an especially rapid run-up in Treasury bill sup- ply. Treasury bill supply remained elevated and report- edly continued to contribute to upward pressure on overnight repurchase agreement (repo) rates. The rela- tively high level of repo rates was associated with con- tinued very modest take-up in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) op- erations. Elevated repo rates may also have contributed to the relatively tight spread between the interest on ex- cess reserves (IOER) rate and the effective federal funds rate. That spread stood at 3 basis points over much of the period and seemed likely to narrow to 2 basis points in the near future. As yet, there were no signs that the upward pressure on the federal funds rate relative to the IOER rate was due to scarcity of aggregate reserves in the banking system. The level of reserves in the banking system temporarily dipped sharply in mid-September in connection with a sizable inflow of tax receipts to the Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Treasury’s account at the Federal Reserve; however, that reduction in reserves in the banking system did not seem to have any effect on the federal funds market or the effective federal funds rate. In reviewing Federal Reserve operations, the manager noted that market reaction to the ongoing reduction in the System’s holdings of Treasury and agency securities had been muted to date. With the increase in the caps on redemptions to be implemented beginning in Octo- ber, reinvestment of Treasury securities would occur al- most exclusively in the middle month of each quarter in connection with the Treasury’s midquarter refunding auctions. Under the baseline path for interest rates, the Federal Reserve’s reinvestments of principal payments on agency mortgage-backed securities would likely fall to zero beginning in October; however, prepayments could rise somewhat above the redemption cap in some months in the future given the uncertainties surrounding prepayment projections. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the September 25–26 meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin- ued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) appeared to be rising at a strong rate in the third quarter, similar to its pace in the first half of the year. The flooding and damage from Hurricane Florence, which made landfall on Septem- ber 14, seemed likely to have a modest, transitory effect on national economic growth in the second half of the year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for per- sonal consumption expenditures (PCE), remained near 2 percent in July. Survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a strong pace, on average, in July and August. The national un- employment rate decreased to 3.9 percent in July and re- mained at that level in August, while the labor force par- ticipation rate and the employment-to-population ratio moved down somewhat, on balance, over those two months. The unemployment rates for African Ameri- cans, Asians, and Hispanics in August were below their levels at the end of the previous expansion. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons de- clined further to below its level in late 2007. The rate of private-sector job openings continued to be elevated in June and July, while the rate of quits moved higher on balance; initial claims for unemployment insurance ben- efits were at a historically low level in mid-September. Total labor compensation per hour in the nonfarm busi- ness sector increased 3.3 percent over the four quarters ending in the second quarter, and average hourly earn- ings for all employees rose 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in August. Industrial production expanded at a solid pace in July and August. Automakers’ assembly schedules suggested that light motor vehicle production would be roughly flat in the fourth quarter, although broader indicators of manufacturing production, such as the new orders in- dexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys, pointed to further solid gains in factory output in the near term. Real PCE appeared to be rising strongly in the third quarter. Retail sales increased somewhat in August, and the data for July were revised up to show a sizable gain. However, the rate of light motor vehicle sales moved down in July and August from the robust pace in the second quarter. The staff’s preliminary assessment was that the consequences of Hurricane Florence would have a slight negative effect on aggregate real PCE growth in the third quarter but that spending would bounce back in the fourth quarter. More broadly, recent readings on key factors that influence consumer spend- ing—including gains in employment, real disposable personal income, and households’ net worth—contin- ued to be supportive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Moreover, consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat in August and early September. Real residential investment looked to be declining fur- ther in the third quarter. Starts for new single-family homes and multifamily units were, on average, below their second-quarter rates in July and August. The issu- ance of building permits for both types of housing stepped down, on net, over those two months, which suggested that starts might move lower in coming months. Sales of both new and existing homes declined somewhat in July, and existing home sales were flat in August. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property appeared to be moderat- ing a little in the third quarter following strong gains in expenditures in the first half of the year. Nominal ship- ments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose briskly in July, although spending for transportation Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ equipment investment moved down in recent months. Forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending—such as increases in new and unfilled capital goods orders, along with upbeat readings on business sentiment from national and regional surveys—pointed to robust gains in equipment spending in the near term. Nominal business expenditures for nonresidential struc- tures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined in July, and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector—held about steady in recent weeks. Total real government purchases looked to be rising fur- ther in the third quarter. Nominal defense spending in July and August was consistent with continued increases in real federal purchases. Real expenditures by state and local governments appeared to be roughly flat, as state and local government payrolls decreased slightly in July and August, while nominal construction spending by these governments rose modestly in July. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in June and July, with declining exports and rising imports. The decline in exports largely reflected lower exports of capital goods, while greater imports of industrial supplies boosted overall imports. The available data suggested that the change in net exports would be a notable drag on real GDP growth in the third quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in July. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 2.0 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.7 percent over the 12 months ending in August, while core CPI inflation was 2.2 percent. Re- cent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Michi- gan survey, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Foreign economic growth slowed in the second quarter, as a pickup in growth for the advanced foreign econo- mies (AFEs) was more than offset by slower growth in the EMEs. Incoming indicators for the AFEs pointed to some moderation in the pace of growth in the third quarter, especially for Canada and Japan, while indica- tors for the EMEs suggested a pickup in many countries from the unusually slow pace of the second quarter. Foreign inflation had risen a bit recently, boosted by higher oil prices and, in the EMEs, higher food prices and recent currency depreciation. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Nominal Treasury yields increased over the intermeeting period, as market reactions to domestic economic data releases that were, on balance, slightly stronger than ex- pected appeared to outweigh ongoing concerns about trade policy and negative developments in some EMEs. FOMC communications over the period were largely in line with expectations and elicited little market reaction. Domestic stock prices rose, buoyed in part by positive news about corporate earnings, while foreign equity in- dexes declined and the broad dollar index moved up. Fi- nancing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of economic activity on balance. Global financial markets were volatile during the inter- meeting period amid significant stress in some EMEs, ongoing focus on Brexit and on fiscal policy in Italy, and continued trade tensions. On balance, the dollar was lit- tle changed against AFE currencies and appreciated against EME currencies, as financial pressures on some EMEs weighed on broader risk sentiment. Turkey and Argentina experienced significant stress, and other countries with similar macroeconomic vulnerabilities also came under pressure. There were small outflows from dedicated emerging market funds, and EME sov- ereign bond spreads widened. Trade tensions weighed on foreign equity prices, as the United States continued its trade negotiations with Canada and placed additional tariffs on Chinese products. FOMC communications elicited limited price reactions in financial markets over the intermeeting period, and market-implied measures of monetary policy expecta- tions were little changed. The probability of an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate occurring at the September FOMC meeting, as implied by quotes on the federal funds futures contracts, increased to near cer- tainty. The market-implied probability of an additional rate increase at the December FOMC meeting rose to about 75 percent. The market-implied path for the fed- eral funds rate beyond 2018 increased a touch. Evolving trade-related risks and other international de- velopments reportedly weighed somewhat on market sentiment. However, domestic economic data releases came in a bit above market expectations, on net, with the stronger-than-expected average hourly earnings in the August employment report notably boosting Treasury yields. Nominal Treasury yields moved up over the in- termeeting period, with the 10-year yield rising above 3 percent. Measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities over the Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ next 5 years ticked up and were little changed 5 to 10 years ahead. over the intermeeting period and stayed near their post- crisis lows. Broad U.S. equity price indexes increased about 4 per- cent since the August FOMC meeting, as positive news about corporate earnings and the domestic economy outweighed negative international developments. Stock prices increased for many sectors in the S&P 500 index, as the second-quarter earnings reports for firms that re- ported later in the earnings cycle came in strong. How- ever, concerns about economic prospects abroad—par- ticularly with respect to trade policy and China—ap- peared to weigh on stocks in the energy and basic mate- rials sectors, which declined. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon—the VIX—moved down but remained somewhat above the extremely low levels seen in late 2017. Spreads of invest- ment- and speculative-grade corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed a bit on net. Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly over the intermeeting period. An elevated level of Treasury bills outstanding, following heavy issuance this summer, continued to put upward pressure on money market rates and reduced the attractiveness of the Federal Re- serve’s ON RRP facility. Take-up at the facility averaged $2.9 billion per day over the intermeeting period. Spreads of unsecured funding rates over comparable- maturity OIS rates continued to retrace the rise in spreads recorded earlier this year. On balance, financing conditions for large nonfinancial firms remained accommodative in recent months. De- mand for corporate borrowing appeared to have de- clined, in part because of strong earnings, rising interest rates, and seasonal factors. In July and August, gross issuance of corporate bonds was relatively weak, while commercial and industrial loan growth moderated. Meanwhile, the pace of equity issuance was solid in July but fell in August, reflecting seasonal factors. Financing conditions for small businesses remained favorable, and survey-based measures of credit demand among small business owners showed signs of strengthening, al- though demand was still weak relative to pre-crisis levels. Gross issuance of municipal bonds continued to be solid. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions also remained accommodative. Although CRE loan growth at banks moderated in July and Au- gust, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was robust. CMBS spreads were little changed Residential mortgage financing conditions remained ac- commodative on balance. For borrowers with low credit scores, however, conditions were still somewhat tight despite continued easing in credit availability. Re- financing activity continued to be muted in recent months, and the growth in purchase mortgage origina- tions slowed a bit relative to year-earlier levels, in part reflecting the notable increase in mortgage rates earlier this year. On net, financing conditions in consumer credit markets were little changed in recent months and remained largely supportive of growth in household spending. However, the supply of credit to consumers with sub- prime credit scores remained tight. More broadly, al- though interest rates for credit cards and auto loans con- tinued to rise, consumer credit expanded at a solid pace. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared for the Septem- ber FOMC meeting, real GDP was projected to increase in the second half of this year at a rate that was just a little slower than in the first half of the year. The staff’s preliminary assessment was that the effects of Hurricane Florence would lead to a slight reduction in real GDP growth in the third quarter and a small addition to growth in the fourth quarter as economic activity re- turned to more normal levels and some disrupted activ- ity was made up. Over the 2018–20 period, output was projected to rise at a rate above or at the staff’s estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natu- ral rate but to bottom out in 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021. Relative to the forecast prepared for the previ- ous meeting, the projection for real GDP growth this year was revised up a little, primarily in response to stronger-than-expected incoming data on household spending and business investment. The projection for the medium term was not materially changed, in part be- cause the recently enacted tariffs on Chinese goods and the retaliatory actions of China were judged to have only a small net effect on U.S. real GDP growth over the next few years. In addition, the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term. The unemployment rate was projected to be a little lower over the medium term than in the previous forecast, partly in response to the staff’s assessment that the natural rate of unemployment was a bit lower than previously assumed. With labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unem- ployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. The staff forecast for total PCE price inflation in 2018 was revised up slightly, mainly because of a faster-than- expected increase in consumer energy prices in the sec- ond half. The staff continued to project that total PCE inflation would remain near the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core PCE price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in con- sumer energy prices in 2019 through 2021. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the down- side, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections are described in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is an addendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in August indicated that the labor market continued to strengthen and that eco- nomic activity rose at a strong rate. Job gains were strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemploy- ment rate stayed low. Recent data suggested that house- hold spending and business fixed investment grew strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy re- mained near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term infla- tion expectations were little changed on balance. Meeting participants noted that a number of communi- ties suffered devastating losses associated with Hurri- cane Florence. Despite the magnitude of the storm- related destruction, participants expected the imprint on the level of overall economic activity at the national level to be relatively modest, consistent with the experience following several previous major storms. Based on recent readings on spending, employment, and inflation, almost all participants saw little change in their assessment of the economic outlook, although a few of them judged that recent data pointed to a pace of eco- nomic activity that was stronger than they had expected earlier this year. Participants noted a number of favora- ble economic factors that were supporting above-trend GDP growth; these included strong labor market condi- tions, stimulative federal tax and spending policies, ac- commodative financial conditions, solid household bal- ance sheets, and continued high levels of household and business confidence. A number of participants observed that the stimulative effects of the changes in fiscal policy would likely diminish over the next several years. A cou- ple of participants commented that recent strong growth in GDP may also be due in part to increases in the growth rate of the economy’s productive capacity. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized consumption growth as strong, and they judged that robust increases in disposable in- come, high levels of consumer confidence, and solid household balance sheets had contributed to the strength in spending. Several participants noted that the household saving rate had been revised up significantly in the most recent estimates published by the Bureau of Economic Activity. A few of those participants re- marked that the upward revision in the saving rate could be viewed as evidence of the strength of the financial position of the household sector and could be a factor that would further support solid expansion of consump- tion spending. However, a couple of participants noted that the higher saving rate may not be a precursor to higher future consumption growth. For example, the higher saving rate may indicate some greater caution on the part of consumers, greater inequality of income and Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ wealth—which would imply a lower aggregate propen- sity to spend—or changing consumer behavior in a low interest rate environment. With regard to residential in- vestment, a few participants noted weak residential con- struction activity at the national or District level, which was attributed in part to higher interest rates or supply constraints. Participants noted that business fixed investment had grown strongly so far this year. A few commented that recent changes in federal tax policy had likely bolstered investment spending. Contacts in most sectors re- mained optimistic about their business prospects, and surveys of manufacturing activity were broadly favora- ble. Despite this optimism, a number of contacts cited factors that were causing them to forego production or investment opportunities in some cases, including labor shortages and uncertainty regarding trade policy. In par- ticular, tariffs on aluminum and steel were cited as re- ducing new investment in the energy sector. Contacts also suggested that firms were attempting to diversify the set of countries with which they trade—both imports and exports—as a result of uncertainty over tariff policy. Contacts in the agricultural industry reported that tariffs imposed by China had resulted in lower crop prices, fur- ther depressing incomes in that sector, although a new federal program was expected to offset some income losses. In their discussion of labor markets, participants gener- ally agreed that conditions continued to strengthen. Contacts in many Districts reported tight labor markets, with difficulty finding qualified workers. In some cases, firms were coping with labor shortages by increasing sal- aries, benefits, or workplace amenities in order to attract and retain workers. Other business contacts facing labor shortages were responding by increasing training for less-qualified workers. For the economy overall, partic- ipants generally agreed that, on balance, recent data sug- gested some acceleration in labor costs, but that wage growth remained moderate by historical standards, which was due in part to tepid productivity growth. Regarding inflation, participants noted that on a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 per- cent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. In general, participants viewed recent consumer price developments as con- sistent with their expectation that inflation was on a tra- jectory to achieve the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis. Several participants com- mented that inflation may modestly exceed 2 percent for a period of time. Reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of Districts also indicated some firming in inflationary pressures. In particular, some contacts indicated that input prices had been bolstered by strong demand or import tariffs. Moreover, several participants reported that firms in their Districts that were facing higher input prices because of tariffs per- ceived that they had an increased ability to raise the prices of their products. A couple of participants em- phasized that because inflation had run below the Com- mittee’s 2 percent objective for the past several years, some measures of trend inflation or longer-term infla- tion expectations were below levels consistent with the 2 percent objective; these participants judged that a modest increase in inflation expectations would be im- portant for achieving the inflation objective on a sus- tained basis. In their discussion of developments in financial markets, a number of participants noted that financial conditions remained accommodative: The rise in interest rates and appreciation of the dollar over the intermeeting period had been offset by increases in equity prices, and broader measures continued to point to accommodative financial conditions. Some participants commented about the continued growth in leveraged loans, the loosening of terms and standards on these loans, or the growth of this activity in the nonbank sector as reasons to remain mindful of vulnerabilities and possible risks to financial stability. Participants commented on a number of risks and un- certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. Participants generally agreed that risks to the out- look appeared roughly balanced. Some participants commented that trade policy developments remained a source of uncertainty for the outlook for domestic growth and inflation. The divergence between domestic and foreign economic growth prospects and monetary policies was cited as presenting a downside risk because of the potential for further strengthening of the U.S. dol- lar; some participants noted that financial stresses in a few EMEs could pose additional risks if they were to spread more broadly through the global economy and financial markets. With regard to upside risks, partici- pants variously noted that high consumer confidence, accommodative financial conditions, or greater-than- expected effects of fiscal stimulus could lead to stronger- than-expected economic outcomes. Tightening re- source utilization and an increasing ability of firms to raise output prices were cited as factors that could lead to higher-than-expected inflation, while lower-than- expected growth, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, or Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation expectations persistently running below 2 per- cent were mentioned as risks that could lead to lower inflation. A few participants offered perspectives on the term structure of interest rates and what a potential inversion of the yield curve might signal about economic pro- spects in light of the historical regularity that an inverted yield curve has often preceded the onset of recessions in the United States. On the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years—reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases— could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity. In addition, the recent rise and possible further increases in longer- term interest rates might diminish the likelihood that the yield curve would invert in the near term. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activ- ity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions con- tinuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s objective. Based on their current assessments, all partic- ipants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to continue its gradual approach to policy firming by raising the target range for the federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. Almost all considered that it was also appropriate to revise the Committee’s postmeeting statement in order to remove the language stating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” Participants discussed a number of reasons for removing the language at this time, noting that the Committee would not be signaling a change in the expected path for policy, particularly as the target range for the federal funds rate announced af- ter the Committee’s meeting would still be below all of the estimates of its longer-run level submitted in the Sep- tember SEP. In addition, waiting until the target range for the federal funds rate had been increased further to remove the characterization of the policy stance as “ac- commodative” could convey a false sense of precision in light of the considerable uncertainty surrounding all es- timates of the neutral federal funds rate. With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally anticipated that fur- ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sus- tained economic expansion, strong labor market condi- tions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term. This gradual approach would balance the risk of tightening monetary policy too quickly, which could lead to an abrupt slowing in the economy and inflation mov- ing below the Committee’s objective, against the risk of moving too slowly, which could engender inflation per- sistently above the objective and possibly contribute to a buildup of financial imbalances. Participants offered their views about how much addi- tional policy firming would likely be required for the Committee to sustainably achieve its objectives of max- imum employment and 2 percent inflation. A few par- ticipants expected that policy would need to become modestly restrictive for a time and a number judged that it would be necessary to temporarily raise the federal funds rate above their assessments of its longer-run level in order to reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances. A couple of participants indicated that they would not favor adopting a restrictive policy stance in the absence of clear signs of an overheating economy and rising infla- tion. Participants reaffirmed that adjustments to the path for the policy rate would depend on their assessments of the evolution of the economic outlook and risks to the out- look relative to the Committee’s statutory objectives. Many of them noted that future adjustments to the tar- get range for the federal funds rate will depend on the evaluation of incoming information and its implications for the economic outlook. In this context, estimates of the level of the neutral federal funds rate would be only one among many factors that the Committee would con- sider in making its policy decisions. Building on comments expressed at previous meetings, a couple of participants indicated that it would be desir- able to assess the Committee’s strategic approach to the conduct of policy and to hold a periodic and systematic review of the strengths and weaknesses of the Commit- tee’s monetary policy framework. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in August indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the un- employment rate had stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment had grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 per- cent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Members viewed the recent data as consistent with an economy that was evolving about as they had expected. Consequently, members expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of eco- nomic activity, strong labor market conditions, and in- flation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objec- tive over the medium term. Members continued to judge that the risks to the economic outlook remained roughly balanced. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers voted to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent. Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to the Committee’s maximum-employment objective and symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. They reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and in- flation expectations, and readings on financial and inter- national developments. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to remove the sentence indicating that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative.” Members made various points regarding the removal of the sentence from the statement. These points included that the characterization of the stance of policy as “ac- commodative” had provided useful forward guidance in the early stages of the policy normalization process, that this characterization was no longer providing meaning- ful information in light of uncertainty surrounding the level of the neutral policy rate, that it was appropriate to remove the characterization of the stance from the Committee’s statement before the target range for the federal funds rate moved closer to the range of estimates of the neutral policy rate, and that the Committee’s ear- lier communications had helped prepare the public for this change. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to exe- cute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective September 27, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to 2¼ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re- purchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven- tions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such op- erations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during Septem- ber that exceeds $24 billion, and to continue re- investing in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during September that exceeds $16 billion. Ef- fective in October, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of prin- cipal payments from the Federal Reserve’s hold- ings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on av- erage, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and Minutes of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer- term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Risks to the eco- nomic outlook appear roughly balanced. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2¼ percent. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting against this action: None. Ms. George voted as alternate member at this meeting. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2.20 percent, effective September 27, 2018. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point in- crease in the primary credit rate (discount rate) to 2.75 percent, effective September 27, 2018.5 Following the vote, Chairman Powell noted that he had asked Governor Clarida to serve as chair of a subcom- mittee on communications issues. The other members of the subcommittee will include Governor Brainard, President Kaplan, and President Rosengren. The role of the subcommittee will be to help prioritize and frame communications issues for the Committee. It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Wednesday–Thursday, Novem- ber 7–8, 2018. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on August 21, 2018, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on July 31–August 1, 2018. Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Esther L. George, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. _____________________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 5 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Rich- mond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2.75 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of September 27, 2018, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and Minneapolis were informed by the Secretary of the Board of the Board’s approval of their estab- lishment of a primary credit rate of 2.75 percent, effective Sep- tember 27, 2018.) The second vote of the Board also encom- passed approval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates. Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on September 25–26, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.1 Each participant’s projections were based on infor- mation available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy— including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer- run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projec- tions represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to con- verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2 “Ap- propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos- ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that, in 2018, real GDP would expand at a pace exceeding their individual estimates of the longer-run growth rate of real GDP. All participants anticipated that real GDP growth would moderate in the coming years, and a majority of participants projected growth in 2021 to be below their estimates of the longer-run rate. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that the unemployment rate would run below their estimates of its longer-run level throughout the projection period. Participants generally projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), would be at or near the Committee’s 2 percent objective at the end of 2018 and would con- tinue at close to that rate through 2021. Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from June, a solid majority of participants marked up their projections of real GDP growth and most increased their forecast of the unemployment rate in 2018, with participants indicating that these revisions mostly re- flected incoming data. Participants’ projections of infla- tion were largely unchanged from June. Table 1 and fig- ure 1 provide summary statistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, almost all participants continued to expect that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate. The medians of participants’ projections of the federal funds rate through 2020 were unchanged relative to their June projections, and the me- dian of participants’ projections for 2021 was the same as that for 2020. The median projection for the longer- run federal funds rate rose slightly, with several partici- pants citing increases in model-based estimates of the longer-run real federal funds rate and strong economic data as reasons for the revision. A substantial majority of participants expected that the year-end 2020 and 2021 federal funds rate would be above their estimates of the longer-run rate. In general, participants continued to view the uncer- tainty around their economic projections as broadly sim- ilar to the average of the past 20 years. Risks to their outlooks were viewed as balanced, although a couple more participants than in June saw risks to their inflation projections as weighted to the upside. The Outlook for Economic Activity The medians of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP, conditional on their individual assess- ments of appropriate monetary policy, were 3.1 percent for 2018, 2.5 percent for 2019, and 2.0 percent for 2020. For this SEP, participants also submitted projections for economic variables in 2021 for the first time. Partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth in 2021 were al- most all below participants’ projections of growth in 2020 and, for a majority of participants, below their longer-run projections of real GDP growth. Some par- ticipants cited the waning of fiscal stimulus, less accom- modative monetary policy, or anticipated appreciation of the dollar as factors contributing to their forecasts for a moderation of real GDP growth over the course of the projection period. 1 Four members of the Board of Governors, one more than in June 2018, were in office at the time of the September 2018 meeting and submitted economic projections. The office of the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was vacant at the time of this FOMC meeting; First Vice Pres- ident Mark A. Gould submitted economic projections. 2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.

One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the federal funds rate. Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ While most participants made slight upward revisions to their unemployment rate projections for this year, their projections in subsequent years and in the longer run were largely unchanged. A substantial majority of par- ticipants expected the unemployment rate to bottom out in 2019 or 2020 at levels below their estimates of the un- employment rate in the longer run, and then to rise a little in 2021. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run. The distribution of individual projections for real GDP growth for this year shifted noticeably to the right relative to that in the June SEP; the distribution for pro- jected real GDP growth for 2019 also shifted to the right, albeit only a little. The distributions of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019 shifted up a little relative to the distributions in June, while the distributions of the projections for the unem- ployment rate in the longer run were largely unchanged. The Outlook for Inflation The medians of projections for total PCE price inflation were 2.1 percent in 2018, 2.0 percent in 2019, and 2.1 percent in 2020 and 2021. The medians of projec- tions for core PCE price inflation were 2.0 percent in 2018 and 2.1 percent in 2019, 2020, and 2021. For the entire period between 2018 and 2020, these medians were very similar to the June SEP. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distributions of participants’ views about the outlook for inflation. Relative to the June SEP, a number of participants revised slightly down their projections for total PCE inflation this year and next. Most participants projected total PCE price infla- tion in the range of 1.9 to 2.0 percent for 2018 and 2019 and 2.1 to 2.2 percent in 2020 and 2021. Most partici- pants projected that core PCE inflation would run at 1.9 to 2.0 percent in 2018 and at 2.1 to 2.2 percent in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Relative to the June SEP, a larger number of participants projected that core PCE inflation in 2019 and 2020 would fall in the 2.1 to 2.2 percent range. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg- ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate for the end of each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run. The distribution of projected policy rates for year-end 2018 was higher than in the June SEP, with projections clustered around 2.4 percent.

As described in the box “Forecast Uncertainty,” under certain assump- tions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Us- ing Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve’s Approach,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2017/files/2017020pap. pdf. 1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. the ends of 2019 and 2020 were relatively wide, as was the case in the June SEP. In discussing their projections, almost all participants continued to express the view that the appropriate tra- jectory of the federal funds rate would likely involve gradual increases. This view was predicated on several factors, including a judgment that a gradual path of pol- icy firming would appropriately balance the risk of a buildup of inflationary pressures or other imbalances as- sociated with high levels of resource utilization, against the risk that factors such as diminishing fiscal stimulus and adverse developments in foreign economies could become a significant drag on real GDP growth. As al- ways, the appropriate path of the federal funds rate would depend on incoming economic data and their im- plications for participants’ economic outlooks and as- sessments of risks. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur.

Those measures are rep- resented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts dis- play the median SEP projections for the three variables surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals derived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the de- gree of uncertainty attending these projections is similar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these confidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of uncer- tainty is substantial and generally increases as the fore- cast horizon lengthens. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Nearly all participants viewed the degree of uncer- tainty attached to their economic projections for real GDP growth and inflation as broadly similar to the av- erage of the past 20 years.3 A couple more participants than in June viewed the uncertainty around the unem- ployment rate as higher than average. Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec- tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Most participants assessed the risks to their projections of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart. Those participants who did not judge the risks to their real GDP growth and unemployment rate projections as balanced were roughly evenly split between those who viewed the risks as being weighted to the upside and those who viewed the risks as being weighted to the downside. Risks around both total and core inflation projections were judged to be broadly balanced by a solid majority of participants; however, those partici- pants who saw the risks as uneven saw them as weighted to the upside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, many participants pointed to up- side risks to real GDP growth from fiscal stimulus or stronger-than-expected effects of business optimism. Many participants also pointed to downside risks for the economy and inflation stemming from factors such as trade policy, stresses in emerging market economies, or stronger-than-anticipated appreciation of the dollar. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate were also subject to considera- ble uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the fed- eral funds rate in response to actual and prospective de- velopments over time in real GDP growth, the unem- ployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re- flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco- nomic variables along with other factors. Figure 5 pro- vides a graphical representation of this uncertainty, plot- ting the median SEP projection for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the re- sults presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the ap- propriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons. 3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of September 25–26, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.8 to 4.2 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 1.1 to 4.9 percent in the third year, and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the fourth year. The corre- sponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall infla- tion would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year, 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 3.1 percent in the third and fourth years. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projec- tions for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion. However, in some instances, the risks around the pro- jections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemploy- ment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro- jection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.

The staff provided briefings that de- scribed changes in recent years in banks’ uses of re- serves, outlined tradeoffs associated with potential choices of operating regimes to implement monetary policy and control short-term interest rates, reviewed potential choices of the policy target rate, and summa- rized developments in the policy implementation frame- works of other central banks. 3 Attended through the discussion of the long-run monetary policy implementation frameworks. 4 Attended Wednesday session only. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ The staff noted that banks’ liquidity management prac- tices had changed markedly since the financial crisis, with large banks now maintaining substantial buffers of reserves, among other high-quality liquid assets, to meet potential outflows and to comply with regulatory re- quirements. Information from bank contacts as well as a survey of banks indicated that, in an environment in which money market interest rates were very close to the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances, banks would likely be comfortable operating with much lower levels of reserve balances than at present but would wish to maintain substantially higher levels of balances than before the crisis. On average, survey responses sug- gested that banks might reduce their reserve holdings only modestly from those “lowest comfortable” levels if money market interest rates were somewhat above the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate. Across banks, however, individual survey responses on this issue varied substantially. The staff highlighted how changes in the determinants of reserve demand since the crisis could affect the tradeoffs between two types of operating regimes: (1) one in which aggregate excess reserves are suffi- ciently limited that money market interest rates are sen- sitive to small changes in the supply of reserves and (2) one in which aggregate excess reserves are suffi- ciently abundant that money market interest rates are not sensitive to small changes in reserve supply. In the for- mer type of regime, the Federal Reserve actively adjusts reserve supply in order to keep its policy rate close to target. This technique worked well before the financial crisis, when reserve demand was fairly stable in the ag- gregate and largely influenced by payment needs and re- serve requirements. However, with the increased use of reserves for precautionary liquidity purposes following the crisis, there was some uncertainty about whether banks’ demand for reserves would now be sufficiently predictable for the Federal Reserve to be able to pre- cisely target an interest rate in this way. In the latter type of regime, money market interest rates are not sensitive to small fluctuations in the demand for and supply of reserves, and the stance of monetary policy is instead transmitted from the Federal Reserve’s administered rates to market rates—an approach that has been effec- tive in controlling short-term interest rates in the United States since the financial crisis, as well as in other coun- tries where central banks have used this approach. The staff briefings also examined the tradeoffs between alternative policy rates that the Committee could choose in each of the regimes. In a regime of limited excess reserves, the Federal Reserve’s policy tools most directly affect overnight unsecured rates paid by banks, such as the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the over- night bank funding rate (OBFR). These rates could also be targeted with abundant excess reserves, as could in- terest rates on secured funding or a mixture of secured and unsecured rates. Participants commented on the advantages of a regime of policy implementation with abundant excess reserves. Based on experience over recent years, such a regime was seen as providing good control of short-term money market rates in a variety of market conditions and effec- tive transmission of those rates to broader financial con- ditions. Participants commented that, by contrast, inter- est rate control might be difficult to achieve in an oper- ating regime of limited excess reserves in view of the po- tentially greater unpredictability of reserve demand re- sulting from liquidity regulations or changes in risk ap- petite, or the increased variability of factors affecting re- serve supply. Participants also observed that regimes with abundant excess reserves could provide effective control of short-term rates even if large amounts of li- quidity needed to be added to address liquidity strains or if large-scale asset purchases needed to be undertaken to provide macroeconomic stimulus in situations where short-term rates are at their effective lower bound. Monetary policy operations in this regime would also not require active management of reserve supply. In addi- tion, the provision of sizable quantities of reserves could enhance financial stability and reduce operational risks in the payment system by maintaining a high level of li- quidity in the banking system. A number of participants commented that the attractive features of a regime of abundant excess reserves should be weighed against the potential drawbacks of such a re- gime as well as the potential benefits of returning to a regime similar to that employed before the financial cri- sis. Potential drawbacks of an abundant reserves regime included challenges in precisely determining the quantity of reserves necessary in such systems, the need to main- tain relatively sizable quantities of reserves and holdings of securities, and relatively large ongoing interest ex- penses associated with the remuneration of reserves. Some noted that returning to a regime of limited excess reserves could demonstrate the Federal Reserve’s ability to fully unwind the policies used to respond to the crisis and might thereby increase public acceptance or effec- tiveness of such policies in the future. Participants noted that the level of reserve balances required to remain in a regime where rate control does not entail active manage- ment of the supply of reserves was quite uncertain, but _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 7–8, 2018Page 3 they thought that reserve supply could be reduced sub- stantially below its current level while remaining in such a regime. They expected to learn more about the de- mand for reserves as the balance sheet continued to shrink in a gradual and predictable manner. They also observed that it might be possible to adopt strategies that provide incentives for banks to reduce their demand for reserves. Participants judged that if the level of re- serves needed for a regime with abundant excess re- serves turned out to be considerably higher than antici- pated, the possibility of returning to a regime in which excess reserves were limited and adjustments in reserve supply were used to influence money market rates would warrant further consideration. Participants noted that lending in the federal funds mar- ket was currently dominated by the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs). Participants cited several potential ben- efits of targeting the OBFR rather than the EFFR: The larger volume of transactions and greater variety of lend- ers underlying the OBFR could make that rate a broader and more robust indicator of banks’ overnight funding costs, the OBFR could become an even better indicator after the potential incorporation of data on onshore wholesale deposits, and the similarity of the OBFR and the EFFR suggested that transitioning to the OBFR would not require significant changes in the way the Committee conducted and communicated monetary policy. Some participants saw it as desirable to explore the possibility of targeting a secured interest rate. Some also expressed interest in studying, over the longer term, approaches in which the Committee would target a mix- ture of secured and unsecured rates. Participants expected to continue their discussion of long-run implementation frameworks and related issues at upcoming meetings. They emphasized that it would be important to communicate clearly the rationale for any choice of operating regime and target interest rate. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) reviewed recent developments in domestic and global financial markets. The equity market was quite volatile over the intermeeting period, with U.S. stock prices down as much as 10 percent at one point before recovering somewhat. Investors pointed to a number of uncertainties in the global outlook that may have con- tributed to the decline in stock prices, including ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China, growing concerns about the fiscal position of the Italian government and its broader implications for financial markets and institutions, and some worries about the outcome of the Brexit negotiations. Market contacts also noted some nervousness about corporate earnings growth and an increase in longer-term Treasury yields over recent weeks as factors contributing to downward pressure on equity prices. The volatility in equity mar- kets was accompanied by a rise in risk spreads on corpo- rate debt, although the widening in risk spreads was not as notable as in some past stock market downturns. On balance, the turbulence in equity markets did not leave much imprint on near-term U.S. monetary policy expectations. Respondents to the Open Market Desk’s recent Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indicated that respondents placed high odds on a further quarter-point increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at the December FOMC meeting; that expectation also seemed to be embedded in federal funds futures quotes. Further out, the median of survey respondents’ modal expectations for the path of the fed- eral funds rate pointed to about three additional policy firmings next year while futures quotes appeared to be pricing in a somewhat flatter trajectory. The manager also reviewed recent developments in global markets. In China, investors were concerned about the apparent slowing of economic expansion and the implications of continued trade tensions with the United States. Chinese stock price indexes declined fur- ther over the intermeeting period and were off nearly 20 percent on the year to date. The renminbi continued to depreciate, moving closer to 7.0 renminbi per dol- lar—a level that some market participants viewed as a possible trigger for intensifying depreciation pressures. Anecdotal reports suggested that Chinese authorities had intervened to support the renminbi. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of re- cent developments in money markets and Desk opera- tions. The EFFR along with other overnight rates edged higher over the weeks following the increase in the target range at the previous meeting. Most recently, the EFFR had risen to the level of the IOER rate, placing it 5 basis points below the top of the target range. The upward pressure on the EFFR and other money market rates re- portedly stemmed partly from a sizable increase in Treasury bill supply and a corresponding increase in Treasury bill yields. In part reflecting that development, FHLBs shifted the composition of their liquidity portfo- lios away from overnight lending in the federal funds market in favor of the higher returns on overnight re- purchase agreements and on interest-bearing deposit ac- counts at banks; these reallocations in their liquidity Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ portfolios in turn contributed to upward pressure on the EFFR. At the same time, anecdotal reports suggested that some depositories were seeking to increase their borrowing in federal funds from FHLBs, partly because of the favorable treatment of such borrowing under li- quidity regulations. In addition, rates on term borrowing had moved higher over recent weeks, perhaps encourag- ing some depositories to bid up rates on overnight fed- eral funds loans. To date, there were no clear signs that the ongoing decline in reserve balances in the banking system associated with the gradual normalization of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet had contributed mean- ingfully to the upward pressure on money market rates. Indeed, banks reportedly were willing to reduce reserve holdings in order to lend in overnight repurchase agree- ment (repo) markets at rates just a few basis points above the IOER rate. However, respondents to the Desk’s recent Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants indi- cated that they anticipated the reduction in the supply of reserves in the banking system could become a very im- portant factor influencing the spread between the IOER rate and the EFFR over the last three quarters of next year. The deputy manager also provided an update on plans to incorporate additional data on overnight depos- its in the OBFR. Banks had begun reporting new data on onshore overnight deposits in October. In aggregate, the volumes reported in onshore overnight deposits were substantial and the rates reported for these instru- ments were very close to rates reported on overnight Eu- rodollar transactions. The new data were expected to be incorporated in the calculation of the OBFR later next year. Following the Desk briefings, the Chairman noted the upward trend in the EFFR relative to the IOER rate over the intermeeting period and suggested that it might be appropriate to implement another technical adjust- ment in the IOER rate relative to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate fairly soon. While the funds rate seemed to have stabilized recently, there re- mained some risk that it could continue to drift higher before the Committee’s next meeting. As a contingency plan, participants agreed that it would be appropriate for the Board to implement such a technical adjustment in the IOER rate before the December meeting if neces- sary to keep the federal funds rate well within the target range established by the FOMC. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the November 7–8 meet- ing indicated that labor market conditions continued to strengthen in recent months and that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong rate in the third quarter, similar to its pace in the first half of the year. Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption ex- penditures (PCE), was 2.0 percent in September. Sur- vey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a strong pace, on average, in September and October. The na- tional unemployment rate decreased to 3.7 percent in September and remained at that level in October, while the labor force participation rate and the employment- to-population ratio moved up somewhat over those two months. The unemployment rates for African Ameri- cans, Asians, and Hispanics in October were below their levels at the end of the previous expansion. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons continued to be close to the lows reached in late 2007. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits both remained at high levels in September; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in late October were close to historically low levels. Total labor compensa- tion per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased 2.8 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, the employment cost index for private workers increased 2.9 percent over the 12 months ending in Sep- tember, and average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 percent over the 12 months ending in October. Industrial production expanded at a solid pace again in September, and indicators for output in the fourth quar- ter were generally positive. Production worker hours in the manufacturing sector increased in October, au- tomakers’ assembly schedules suggested that light motor vehicle production would rise in the fourth quarter, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufac- turing surveys pointed to solid gains in factory output in the near term. Real PCE continued to grow strongly in the third quar- ter. Overall consumer spending rose steadily in recent months, and light motor vehicle sales stepped up to a robust pace in September and edged higher in October. _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 7–8, 2018Page 5 Key factors that influence consumer spending—includ- ing solid gains in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home values on households’ net worth—continued to be sup- portive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Con- sumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained upbeat in October. Real residential investment declined further in the third quarter, likely reflecting a range of factors including the continued effects of rising mortgage interest rates on the affordability of housing. Starts of both new single- family homes and multifamily units decreased last quar- ter, but building permit issuance for new single-family homes—which tends to be a good indicator of the un- derlying trend in construction of such homes—was little changed on net. Sales of both new and existing homes declined again in the third quarter, while pending home sales edged up in September. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property moderated in the third quarter following strong gains in these expenditures in the first half of the year. Nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down over the two months ending in September after brisk increases in July, while readings on business senti- ment remained upbeat. Real business expenditures for nonresidential structures declined in the third quarter both for the drilling and mining sector and outside that sector. The number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation—an indicator of business spending for struc- tures in the drilling and mining sector—held about steady from late May through late October. Total real government purchases rose in the third quar- ter. Real federal purchases increased, mostly reflecting higher defense expenditures. Real purchases by state and local governments also increased, as real construc- tion spending by these governments rose and payrolls expanded. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened in August and September. Exports decreased in August but more than recovered in September, reflecting the pattern of industrial supplies exports. Imports of con- sumer goods led imports higher in both months. The change in net exports was estimated to have been a siz- able drag on real GDP growth in the third quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2.0 percent over the 12 months ending in September. Core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, also was 2.0 percent over that same period. The con- sumer price index (CPI) rose 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while core CPI infla- tion was 2.2 percent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—includ- ing those from the Michigan survey, the Blue Chip Eco- nomic Indicators, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Foreign economic growth appeared to pick up in the third quarter, as a strong rebound in economic activity in several emerging market economies (EMEs) more than offset a slowdown in China and most advanced for- eign economies (AFEs). Preliminary GDP data showed that Mexico’s economy grew briskly, reversing its sec- ond-quarter contraction, while indicators suggested that Brazil’s economy rebounded from a nationwide truck- ers’ strike. In contrast, GDP growth slowed in China and the euro area, and indicators pointed to a step-down in Japanese growth. Foreign inflation picked up in the third quarter, boosted by higher oil prices and, in China, by higher food prices. However, underlying inflation pressures remained muted, especially in some AFEs. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Concerns about ongoing international trade tensions, the global growth outlook, and rising interest rates weighed on global equity market sentiment over the in- termeeting period. Domestic stock prices declined con- siderably, on net, and equity market implied volatility rose. Nominal Treasury yields ended the period higher amid some moderate volatility, and the broad dollar in- dex moved up. Financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses and households remained supportive of eco- nomic activity on balance. During the intermeeting period, broad U.S. equity price indexes declined considerably, on net, amid somewhat elevated day-to-day volatility. Various factors appeared to weigh on investor sentiment including news related to ongoing international trade tensions and investors’ con- cerns about the sustainability of strong corporate earn- ings growth. Stock prices in the basic materials and in- dustrial sectors underperformed the broader market, re- portedly reflecting an increase in trade tensions with China. More broadly, investors seemed to reassess eq- uity valuations that appeared elevated. Investors also re- acted to some large firms raising concerns about the ef- fect of rising costs on their future profitability in their latest earnings reports. Option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index at the one-month horizon—the VIX— Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ increased, though it remained below the levels seen in early February. Despite the considerable declines in do- mestic stock prices, spreads of investment- and specula- tive-grade corporate bonds over comparable-maturity Treasury yields widened only modestly. FOMC communications over the intermeeting period were viewed by market participants as consistent with a continued gradual removal of monetary policy accom- modation. Market-implied measures of monetary policy expectations were generally little changed. Investors continued to see virtually no odds of a further quarter- point firming in the target range for the federal funds rate at the November FOMC meeting and high odds of a further firming at the December FOMC meeting. The market-implied path for the federal funds rate beyond 2018 increased a bit. Medium- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields ended the period higher amid some moderate volatility over the intermeeting period. Meanwhile, measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities declined somewhat, with some of the decline occurring following the weaker-than-ex- pected September CPI release. Overnight interest rates in short-term funding markets rose in line with the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate announced at the September FOMC meeting. Over the intermeeting period, the spread be- tween the EFFR and the IOER rate narrowed from 2 basis points to 0 basis points. Take-up at the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility remained low. Over the intermeeting period, global investors focused on changes in U.S. equity prices and interest rates, ongo- ing trade tensions between the United States and China, and uncertainty regarding budget negotiations between the Italian government and the European Union. For- eign equity prices posted notable net declines; option- implied measures of foreign equity volatility spiked in October but remained well below levels seen in February and subsequently retraced some of those increases. Ten- year Italian sovereign bond spreads over German equiv- alents widened significantly, and there were moderate spillovers to other euro-area peripheral spreads. Bond yields in Germany and the United Kingdom fell, partly reflecting weaker-than-expected inflation data and Eu- ropean political developments. In contrast, Canadian yields increased slightly, bolstered by the announcement of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and a policy rate hike by the Bank of Canada. The dollar appreciated against most advanced and emerging market currencies, and EME-dedicated funds experienced small outflows. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms continued to be supportive of borrowing and spending over the in- termeeting period. Net debt financing of nonfinancial firms was robust in the third quarter, as weak specula- tive-grade bond issuance was largely offset by rapid lev- eraged loan issuance. The pace of equity issuance was solid in September but slowed somewhat in October. The outlook for corporate earnings remained favorable on balance. Respondents to the October Senior Loan Officer Opin- ion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) re- ported, on net, that their institutions had eased standards and terms for commercial and industrial loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three months. All respondents that had done so cited increased competi- tion from other lenders as an important reason. The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations remained solid, though there were some signs of modest deterio- ration. Gross issuance of municipal bonds in September and October was strong, much of which raised new cap- ital. Financing conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector remained accommodative. Banks in the October SLOOS reported, on a portfolio-weighted ba- sis, an easing of standards on CRE loans over the third quarter on net. Interest rate spreads on commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) remained near their post-crisis lows, while issuance of non-agency and agency CMBS was stable in recent months and similar to year-earlier levels. Most borrowers in the residential mortgage market con- tinued to experience accommodative financing condi- tions, although the increase in mortgage rates since 2016 appeared to have reduced housing demand, and financ- ing conditions remained somewhat tight for borrowers with low credit scores. Growth in home-purchase mort- gage originations slowed over the past year as mortgage rates stayed near their highest level since 2011, and refi- nancing activity continued to be very muted. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets, on balance, remained supportive of growth in household spending, although interest rates for consumer loans continued to rise. Credit card loan growth showed signs of moderating amid rising interest rates and reported tightening of lending standards at the largest credit card banks. Compared with the beginning of this year, re- spondents to the October 2018 SLOOS reported, on a _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 7–8, 2018Page 7 portfolio-weighted basis, a reduced willingness to issue credit card loans to borrowers across the credit spectrum and, in particular, to borrowers with lower credit scores; meanwhile, banks reported having eased standards on auto loans. The staff provided its latest report on potential risks to financial stability; the report again characterized the fi- nancial vulnerabilities of the U.S. financial system as moderate on balance. This overall assessment incorpo- rated the staff’s judgment that vulnerabilities associated with asset valuation pressures continued to be elevated, that vulnerabilities from financial-sector leverage and maturity and liquidity transformation remained low, and that vulnerabilities from household leverage were still in the low-to-moderate range. Additionally, the staff judged vulnerabilities from leverage in the nonfinancial business sector as elevated and noted a pickup in the is- suance of risky debt and the continued deterioration in underwriting standards on leveraged loans. The staff also characterized overall vulnerabilities to foreign finan- cial stability as moderate while highlighting specific is- sues in some foreign economies, including—depending on the country—high private or sovereign debt burdens, external vulnerabilities, and political uncertainties. Staff Economic Outlook In the U.S. economic forecast prepared for the Novem- ber FOMC meeting, the staff continued to project that real GDP would increase a little less rapidly in the sec- ond half of the year than in the first half. Hurricanes Florence and Michael had devastating effects on many communities, but they appeared likely to leave essentially no imprint on the national economy in the second half of the year as a whole. Relative to the forecast prepared for the previous meeting, the projection for real GDP growth this year was little revised. Over the 2018–20 pe- riod, output was forecast to rise at a rate above or at the staff’s estimate of potential growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021. The unemployment rate was pro- jected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer-run natural rate but to bottom out in 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021. The medium-term projection for real GDP growth was only a bit weaker than in the previous forecast, primarily reflecting a lower projected path for equity prices, leaving the unemployment rate forecast little revised. With labor market conditions al- ready tight, the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. The staff expected both total and core PCE price infla- tion to remain close to 2 percent through the medium term. The staff’s forecasts for both total and core PCE price inflation were little revised on net. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the down- side, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Participants’ View on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in September indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expecta- tions were little changed on balance. Based on recent readings on spending, prices, and the labor market, participants generally indicated little change in their assessment of the economic outlook, with above-trend economic growth expected to con- tinue before slowing to a pace closer to trend over the medium term. Participants pointed to several factors supporting above-trend growth, including strong em- ployment gains, expansionary federal tax and spending policies, and continued high levels of consumer and business confidence. Several participants observed that the stimulative effects of fiscal policy would likely dimin- ish over time, while the lagged effects of reductions in monetary policy accommodation would show through Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ more fully, with both factors contributing to their expec- tation that economic growth would slow to a pace closer to trend. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally continued to characterize consumption growth as strong. This view was supported by reports from Dis- trict contacts, which were mostly upbeat regarding con- sumer spending. Although household spending overall was seen as strong, most participants noted weakness in residential investment. This weakness was attributed to a variety of factors, including increased mortgage rates, building cost increases, and supply constraints. Participants observed that growth in business fixed in- vestment slowed in the third quarter following several quarters of rapid growth. Some participants pointed to anecdotal evidence regarding higher tariffs and uncer- tainty about trade policy, slowing global demand, rising input costs, or higher interest rates as possible factors contributing to the slowdown. A couple of others noted that business investment growth can be volatile on a quarterly basis and factors such as the recent cuts in cor- porate taxes and high levels of business sentiment were expected to support investment going forward. Reports from District contacts in the manufacturing, en- ergy, and service sectors were generally favorable, though growth in manufacturing activity was reportedly moderating in a couple of Districts. Business contacts generally remained optimistic about the outlook, but concerns about trade policy, slowing foreign demand, and labor shortages were reportedly weighing on busi- ness prospects. Contacts in the agricultural sector re- ported that conditions remain depressed, in part, due to the effects of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes. Participants agreed that labor market conditions had strengthened further over the intermeeting period. Pay- rolls had increased strongly in October, and measures of labor market tightness such as rates of job openings and quits continued to be elevated. The unemployment rate remained at a historically low level in October, and the labor force participation rate moved up. A couple of participants saw scope for further increases in the labor force participation rate as the strong economy pulled more workers into the labor market, while a couple of other participants judged that there was little scope for significant further increases. Contacts in many Districts continued to report tight la- bor markets with difficulties finding qualified workers. In some cases, firms were responding to these difficul- ties by increasing training for less-qualified workers, out- sourcing work, or automating production, while in other cases, firms were responding by raising wages. Contacts in a couple of Districts indicated that labor shortages, particularly for skilled labor, might be constraining activ- ity in certain industries. Participants observed that, at the national level, measures of nominal wage growth ap- peared to be picking up. Many participants noted that the recent pace of aggregate wage gains was broadly con- sistent with trends in productivity growth and inflation. Participants observed that both overall and core PCE price inflation remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis. In general, participants viewed recent price devel- opments as consistent with their expectation that infla- tion would remain near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis. Reports from business contacts and surveys in a number of Districts were consistent with some firming in inflationary pres- sure. Contacts in many Districts indicated that input costs had risen and that increased tariffs were raising costs, especially for industries relying heavily on steel and aluminum. In a few Districts, transportation costs had reportedly increased. Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass- through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited. Participants commented on a number of risks and un- certainties associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation over the medium term. A few participants indicated that uncertainty had increased recently, pointing to the high levels of uncer- tainty regarding the effects of fiscal and trade policies on economic activity and inflation. Some participants viewed economic and financial developments abroad, including the possibility of further appreciation of the U.S. dollar, as posing downside risks for domestic eco- nomic growth and inflation. A couple of participants expressed the concern that measures of inflation expec- tations would remain low, particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected. Several participants were concerned that the high level of debt in the nonfi- nancial business sector, and especially the high level of leveraged loans, made the economy more vulnerable to a sharp pullback in credit availability, which could exac- erbate the effects of a negative shock on economic ac- tivity. The potential for an escalation in tariffs or trade tensions was also cited as a factor that could slow eco- nomic growth more than expected. With regard to up- side risks, participants noted that greater-than-expected effects of fiscal stimulus and high consumer confidence _____________________________________________________________________________________________Minutes of the Meeting of November 7–8, 2018Page 9 could lead to stronger-than-expected economic out- comes. Some participants raised the concern that tight- ening resource utilization in conjunction with an in- crease in the ability of firms to pass through increases in tariffs or in other input costs to consumer prices could generate undesirable upward pressure on inflation. In general, participants agreed that risks to the outlook ap- peared roughly balanced. In their discussion of financial developments, partici- pants observed that financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, as equity prices declined, longer-term yields and borrowing costs for most sectors increased, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose. Despite these developments, a number of partici- pants judged that financial conditions remained accom- modative relative to historical norms. Among those who commented on financial stability, a number cited possible risks related to elevated CRE prices, narrow corporate bond spreads, or strong issu- ance of leveraged loans. A few participants suggested that some of these financial vulnerabilities might not currently represent risks to financial stability so much as they represent downside risks to the economic outlook; a couple of participants suggested that financial stability risks and risks to the outlook are interconnected. A cou- ple of participants also commented on the upcoming re- lease of the Board’s first public Financial Stability Report and noted that the report would increase the transpar- ency of the Federal Reserve’s financial stability work as well as enhance communications on this topic. In their discussion of monetary policy, participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the cur- rent target range for the federal funds rate at this meet- ing. Participants generally judged that the economy had been evolving about as they had anticipated, with eco- nomic activity rising at a strong rate, labor market con- ditions continuing to strengthen, and inflation running at or near the Committee’s longer-run objective. Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Commit- tee’s objectives of maximum employment and price sta- bility. Consistent with their judgment that a gradual approach to policy normalization remained appropriate, almost all participants expressed the view that another increase in the target range for the federal funds rate was likely to be warranted fairly soon if incoming information on the labor market and inflation was in line with or stronger than their current expectations. However, a few partici- pants, while viewing further gradual increases in the tar- get range of the federal funds rate as likely to be appro- priate, expressed uncertainty about the timing of such increases. A couple of participants noted that the federal funds rate might currently be near its neutral level and that further increases in the federal funds rate could un- duly slow the expansion of economic activity and put downward pressure on inflation and inflation expecta- tions. Participants emphasized that the Committee’s approach to setting the stance of policy should be importantly guided by incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook. They noted that their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were based on their current assessment of the economic outlook. Monetary policy was not on a preset course; if incoming infor- mation prompted meaningful reassessments of the eco- nomic outlook and attendant risks, either to the upside or the downside, their policy outlook would change. Various factors such as the recent tightening in financial conditions, risks in the global outlook, and some signs of slowing in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy on the one hand, and further indicators of tightness in labor markets and possible inflationary pressures, on the other hand, were noted in this context. Participants also commented on how the Committee’s communications in its postmeeting statement might need to be revised at coming meetings, particularly the language referring to the Committee’s expectations for “further gradual in- creases” in the target range for the federal funds rate. Many participants indicated that it might be appropriate at some upcoming meetings to begin to transition to statement language that placed greater emphasis on the evaluation of incoming data in assessing the economic and policy outlook; such a change would help to convey the Committee’s flexible approach in responding to changing economic circumstances. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in September indicated that the la- bor market had continued to strengthen and that eco- nomic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of busi- ness fixed investment had moderated recently from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. Indicators of long- Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ term inflation expectations were little changed on bal- ance. Members generally judged that the economy had been evolving about as they had anticipated at the previous meeting. Financial conditions, although somewhat tighter than at the time of the September FOMC meet- ing, had stayed accommodative overall, while the effects of expansionary fiscal policies enacted over the past year were expected to continue through the medium term. Consequently, members continued to expect that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 percent ob- jective over the medium term. Members continued to judge that the risks to the economic outlook were roughly balanced. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2¼ percent. Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assess- ment of realized and expected economic conditions rel- ative to the Committee’s maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives. They reiter- ated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and in- flation expectations, and readings on financial and inter- national developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective November 9, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to 2¼ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate or similar holiday, trading weekend, conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to in agency mortgage- continue reinvesting backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined.

Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. Consistent with the Committee’s decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the in- terest rates on required and excess reserve balances un- changed at 2.20 percent and voted unanimously to ap- prove establishment of the primary credit rate at the ex- isting level of 2.75 percent, effective November 9, 2018. Update from Subcommittee on Communications Governor Clarida presented a proposal from the sub- committee on communications to conduct a review dur- ing 2019 of the Federal Reserve’s strategic framework for monetary policy. This assessment would consider the strategy, tools, and communications that would best enable the Federal Reserve to meet its statutory objec- tives of maximum employment and price stability. With labor market conditions close to maximum employment and inflation near the Committee’s 2 percent objective, it was an opportune time for the Federal Reserve to un- dertake this review and assess the robustness of its stra- tegic framework. During the review, the Federal Reserve would engage with a broad range of interested stakeholders across the country and host a research conference in June 2019. FOMC participants would discuss the strategic frame- work at subsequent FOMC meetings, drawing on the lessons from the outreach efforts and on staff analysis. The goal of these discussions would be to identify pos- sible ways to improve the Committee’s current strategic policy framework in order to ensure that the Federal Re- serve is best positioned going forward to achieve its stat- utory mandate. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on October 16, 2018, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on September 25–26, 2018. _______________________ James A.

Winford, Information Management Analyst, Division of Monetary Affairs, Board of Governors Implementation Long-Run Monetary Policy Frameworks Committee participants resumed their discussion from the November 2018 FOMC meeting of potential long- run frameworks for monetary policy implementation. At the December meeting, the staff provided a set of briefings that considered various issues related to the transition to a long-run operating regime with lower lev- els of excess reserves than at present and to a long-run composition of the balance sheet. The staff noted that during the transition to a long-run operating regime with excess reserves below current lev- els, the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) could begin to rise a little above the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate as reserves in the banking system declined gradually to a level that the Committee judges to be most appropriate for efficient and effective implementation of policy. This upward movement in the federal funds rate 3 Attended through the discussion of the long-run monetary policy implementation frameworks. 4 Attended the discussion of financial developments and open market operations through the close of the meeting. 5 Attended Tuesday session only. Page 2Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ could be gradual. However, the staff noted that the fed- eral funds rate and other money market rates could pos- sibly become somewhat volatile at times as banks and financial markets adjusted to lower levels of reserve bal- ances. Were upward pressures on the federal funds rate to emerge, it could be challenging to distinguish between pressures that were transitory and likely to abate as fi- nancial institutions adjust and those that were more per- sistent and associated with aggregate reserve scarcity. The staff reported on the monitoring of conditions in money markets as well as various survey and market out- reach activities that could assist in detecting reserve scar- city. The staff reviewed a number of steps that the Fed- eral Reserve could take to ensure effective monetary pol- icy implementation were upward pressures on the fed- eral funds rate and other money market rates to emerge. These steps included lowering the IOER rate further within the target range, using the discount window to support the efficient distribution of reserves, and slow- ing or smoothing the pace of reserve decline through open market operations or through slowing portfolio re- demptions. The staff also discussed new ceiling tools that could help keep the EFFR within the Committee’s target range, including options that would add new counterparties for the Open Market Desk’s operations. The staff also provided a review of the liabilities on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet; the review described the factors that influence the size of reserve and nonreserve liabilities and discussed the increase in the size of these liabilities since the financial crisis. Additionally, the staff outlined various issues related to the long-run composi- tion of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) port- folio, including the maturity composition of the portfo- lio’s Treasury securities and the management of residual holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) after the Committee has normalized the size of the bal- ance sheet. In discussing the transition to a long-run operating re- gime, participants commented on the advantages and disadvantages of allowing reserves to decline to a level that could put noticeable upward pressure on the federal funds rate, at least for a time. Reducing reserves close to the lowest level that still corresponded to the flat por- tion of the reserve demand curve would be one ap- proach consistent with the Committee’s previously stated intention, in the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans that it issued in 2014, to “hold no more secu- rities than necessary to implement monetary policy effi- ciently and effectively.” However, reducing reserves to a point very close to the level at which the reserve de- mand curve begins to slope upward could lead to a sig- nificant increase in the volatility in short-term interest rates and require frequent sizable open market opera- tions or new ceiling facilities to maintain effective inter- est rate control. These considerations suggested that it might be appropriate to instead provide a buffer of re- serves sufficient to ensure that the Federal Reserve op- erates consistently on the flat portion of the reserve de- mand curve so as to promote the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy. Participants discussed options for maintaining control of interest rates should upward pressures on money market rates emerge during the transition to a regime with lower excess reserves. Several participants commented on op- tions that rely on existing or currently used tools, such as further technical adjustments to the IOER rate to keep the federal funds rate within the target range or us- ing the discount window, although such options were recognized to have limitations in some situations. Some participants commented on the possibility of slowing the pace of the decline in reserves in approaching the longer- run level of reserves. Standard temporary open market operations could be used for this purpose. In addition, participants discussed options such as ending portfolio redemptions with a relatively high level of reserves still in the system and then either maintaining that level of reserves or allowing growth in nonreserve liabilities to very gradually reduce reserves further. These ap- proaches could allow markets and banks more time to adjust to lower reserve levels while maintaining effective control of interest rates. Several participants, however, expressed concern that a slowing of redemptions could be misinterpreted as a signal about the stance of mone- tary policy. Some participants expressed an interest in learning more about possible options for new ceiling tools to provide firmer control of the policy rate. Participants commented on the role that the Federal Re- serve’s nonreserve liabilities have played in the expan- sion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet since the fi- nancial crisis. Many participants noted that the magni- tudes of these nonreserve liabilities—most significantly currency but also liabilities to the Treasury through the Treasury General Account and liabilities to foreign offi- cial institutions through their accounts at the Federal Re- serve—are not closely related to Federal Reserve mone- tary policy decisions. They also remarked that the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet was expected to increase over time as the growth of these liabilities roughly tracks the growth of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). Additionally, participants cited the so- cial benefits provided by these liabilities to the economy. Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 3_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Participants considered it important to present infor- mation on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to the public in ways that communicated these facts. In dis- cussing the long-run level of reserve liabilities, partici- pants noted that it might be useful to explore ways to encourage banks to reduce their demand for reserves and to provide information to banks and the public about the likely long-run level of reserves. Participants commented on a number of issues related to the long-run composition of the SOMA portfolio. With regard to the portfolio of Treasury securities, par- ticipants discussed the advantages of different portfolio maturity compositions. Several participants noted that a portfolio of holdings weighted toward shorter maturities would provide greater flexibility to lengthen maturity if warranted by an economic downturn, while a couple of others noted that a portfolio with maturities that matched the outstanding Treasury market would have a more neutral effect on the market. With regard to the MBS portfolio, participants noted that the passive run- off of MBS holdings through principal paydowns would continue for many years after the size of the balance sheet had been normalized. Several participants com- mented on the possibility of reducing agency MBS hold- ings somewhat more quickly than the passive approach by implementing a program of very gradual MBS sales sometime after the size of the balance sheet had been normalized. Participants expected to continue their discussion of long-run implementation frameworks and related issues at upcoming meetings. They reiterated the importance of communicating clearly on the rationale for any deci- sion made on the implementation framework. Developments in Financial Markets and Open Mar- ket Operations The SOMA manager reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period. Asset prices were volatile in recent weeks, reportedly reflecting a pullback from risk-taking by investors. In part, the deterioration in risk sentiment appeared to stem importantly from un- certainty about the state of trade negotiations between China and the United States. In addition, investors pointed to concerns about the global growth outlook, the unsettled state of Brexit negotiations, and uncertain- ties about the political situation in Europe. Against this backdrop, U.S. stock prices were down nearly 8 percent on the period. Risk spreads on corpo- rate bonds widened appreciably, with market partici- pants reportedly focusing on the potential implications of downside risks to the U.S. economic outlook for the financial condition of companies, particularly for com- panies at the lower end of the investment-grade spec- trum. Treasury yields declined significantly, especially at longer maturities, contributing to some flattening of the Treasury yield curve. Based on readings from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), the decline in nominal Treasury yields was associated with a notable drop in inflation compensation. A sizable decline in oil prices was cited as an important factor contributing to the drop in measures of inflation compensation. The deterioration in market sentiment was accompanied by a significant downward revision in the expected path of the federal funds rate based on federal funds futures quotes. In addition, futures-based measures of policy expectations moved lower in response to speeches by Federal Reserve officials. The revision in the expected policy path was less noticeable in the Desk’s survey- based measures of the expected path of the federal funds rate. Desk surveys indicated that respondents placed high odds on a further quarter-point firming in the stance of monetary policy at the December meeting, but lower than the near certainty of a rate increase reported just before previous policy firmings in 2018; survey re- sponses anticipated that the median projected path of the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Pro- jections (SEP) would show only two additional quarter- point policy firmings next year—down from the three policy firmings in the median path in the September SEP results. The deputy manager followed with a discussion of money market developments and open market opera- tions. After a fast narrowing of the spread between the IOER rate and the EFFR before the November meet- ing, the EFFR had remained stable at, or just 1 basis point below the level of the IOER rate since then. Some upward pressures on overnight rates were evident in the repurchase agreement (repo) market, apparently from higher issuance of Treasury bills and an associated ex- pansion of primary dealer inventories over the inter- meeting period. Banks expanded their lending in repo markets in light of higher repo rates relative to the IOER rate; the willingness of banks to lend in repo markets suggested that the reserve supply was still ample. The deputy manager noted the results of the recent Desk sur- veys of primary dealers and market participants indicat- ing an increase in the median respondent’s estimate of the long-run level of reserve balances to a level closer to that implied by banks’ responses in the Senior Financial Officer Survey conducted in advance of the November FOMC meeting. The deputy manager also reported on paydowns on the SOMA securities holdings. Under the Page 4Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ baseline outlook, prepayments of principal on agency MBS would remain below the $20 billion redemption cap for the foreseeable future. However, if longer-term interest rates moved substantively lower than assumed in the baseline, some modest reinvestments in MBS could occur for a few months next year concurrent with the pickup in seasonal turnover. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk’s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign curren- cies for the System’s account during the intermeeting pe- riod. Staff Review of the Economic Situation The information reviewed for the December 18–19 meeting indicated that labor market conditions contin- ued to strengthen in recent months and that real GDP growth was strong. Consumer price inflation, as meas- ured by the 12-month percentage change in the price in- dex for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was 2 percent in October. Survey-based measures of longer- run inflation expectations were little changed on balance. Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded further in November, and job gains were strong, on average, over recent months. The national unemployment rate re- mained at a very low level of 3.7 percent, and both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to- population ratio also stayed flat in November. The un- employment rates for African Americans, Asians, and Hispanics in November were below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion. The share of workers employed part time for economic reasons was still close to the lows reached in late 2007. The rates of private-sector job openings and quits were both still at high levels in October; initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in early December were still close to historically low levels. Total labor compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector—a volatile measure even on a four-quarter change basis—increased 2.2 per- cent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter. Average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3.1 per- cent over the 12 months ending in November. Industrial production expanded, on net, over October and November. Output increased in the mining and util- ities sectors, while manufacturing production edged down on balance. Automakers’ assembly schedules sug- gested that production of light motor vehicles would rise in December, and new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to moderate gains in total factory output in the coming months. Household spending continued to increase at a strong pace in recent months. Real PCE growth was brisk in October, and the components of the nominal retail sales used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to construct its estimate of PCE rose considerably in November. The pace of light motor vehicle sales edged down in No- vember but stayed near its recent elevated level. Key factors that influence consumer spending—including ongoing gains in real disposable personal income and the effects of earlier increases in equity prices and home val- ues on households’ net worth—continued to be sup- portive of solid real PCE growth in the near term. Con- sumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, remained relatively up- beat through early December. Real residential investment appeared to be declining fur- ther in the fourth quarter, likely reflecting in part the ef- fects of the rise in mortgage interest rates over the past year on the affordability of housing. Starts of new sin- gle-family homes decreased in October and November, although starts of multifamily units rose sharply in No- vember. Building permit issuance for new single-family homes, which tends to be a good indicator of the under- lying trend in construction of such homes, moved down modestly over recent months. Sales of new homes de- clined markedly in October, although existing home sales increased modestly. Growth in real private expenditures for business equip- ment and intellectual property looked to be picking up solidly in the fourth quarter after moderating in the pre- vious quarter. Nominal shipments of nondefense capital in October. goods excluding aircraft moved up Forward-looking indicators of business equipment spending—such as a rising backlog of unfilled orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and upbeat readings on business sentiment—pointed to further spending gains in the near term. Nominal business ex- penditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector declined modestly in October, while the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in op- eration—an indicator of business spending for struc- tures in the drilling and mining sector—held about steady in November through early December. Total real government purchases appeared to be rising moderately in the fourth quarter. Nominal defense spending in October and November pointed to solid growth in real federal purchases. Real purchases by state and local governments looked to be only edging up, as nominal construction spending by these governments Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ rose solidly in October but their payrolls declined a little in October and November. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened slightly in October. Exports declined a little, with de- creases in exports of agricultural products and capital goods, although exports of industrial supplies increased. Imports rose a bit, with increases in imports of con- sumer goods and automotive products, but imports of capital goods declined sharply from September’s ele- vated level. Available trade data suggested that the con- tribution of the change in net exports to the rate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter. Total U.S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 2 percent over the 12 months end- ing in October. Core PCE price inflation, which ex- cludes changes in consumer food and energy prices, was 1.8 percent over that same period. The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.2 percent over the 12 months ending in November, and core CPI inflation was also 2.2 per- cent. Recent readings on survey-based measures of longer-run inflation expectations—including those from the Michigan survey, the Survey of Professional Fore- casters, and the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and Survey of Market Participants—were little changed on balance. Foreign economic growth continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter, as a pickup in emerging market economies (EMEs) roughly offset slowing growth in ad- vanced foreign economies (AFEs). Among EMEs, growth in Mexico and Brazil bounced back from transi- tory second-quarter weakness, more than offsetting a slowdown in China and India. The softness in AFE growth partly reflected temporary factors, including dis- ruptions from natural disasters in Japan and the adop- tion of new car emissions testing in Germany. Indica- tors for economic activity in the fourth quarter were consistent with continued moderate foreign economic growth. Foreign inflation fell in recent months, largely reflecting a significant drag from lower oil prices. Un- derlying inflation pressures, especially in some AFEs, re- mained muted. Staff Review of the Financial Situation Investors’ perceptions of downside risks to the domestic and global outlook appeared to increase over the inter- meeting period, reportedly driven in part by signs of slowing in foreign economies and growing concerns over escalating trade frictions. Both nominal U.S. Treas- ury yields and U.S. equity prices declined notably over the period. Financing conditions for businesses and households tightened a bit but generally remained sup- portive of economic growth. Remarks by Federal Reserve officials over the intermeet- ing period were interpreted by market participants as sig- naling a shift in the stance of policy toward a more grad- ual path of federal funds rate increases. The market- implied path for the federal funds rate for 2019 and 2020 shifted down markedly, while the market-implied prob- ability for a rate hike at the December FOMC meeting declined slightly though remained high. Nominal Treasury yields fell considerably over the pe- riod, with the declines most pronounced in longer-dated maturities and contributing to a flattening of the yield curve. The spread between 10- and 2-year nominal Treasury yields narrowed to near the 20th percentile of its distribution since 1971. Investor perceptions of in- creased downside risks to the outlooks for domestic and foreign economic growth, including growing concerns over trade frictions between the United States and China, reportedly weighed on yields. Measures of infla- tion compensation derived from TIPS also decreased notably over the period along with the declines in oil prices. Concerns over escalating trade tensions, global growth prospects, and the sustainability of corporate earnings growth were among the factors that appeared to contrib- ute to a significant drop in U.S. equity prices. The de- clines were largest in the technology and retail sectors. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 in- dex—the VIX—increased over the period and corpo- rate credit spreads widened, consistent with the selloff in equities. Over the intermeeting period, foreign financial markets were affected by perceived increases in downside risks to the global growth outlook and ongoing uncertainty about trade relations between the United States and China. Investors also focused on the state of negotia- tions over Brexit and the Italian government budget def- icit. Equity markets in AFEs posted notable declines, and Europe-dedicated bond and equity funds reported strong outflows. Equity declines in EMEs were more modest, and emerging market funds received modest in- flows on net. AFE sovereign yields declined significantly, reflecting decreases in U.S. bond yields and weaker-than-expected euro-area and U.K. economic data. Measures of infla- tion compensation generally fell, partly reflecting sharp decreases in oil prices. Spreads of Italian sovereign Page 6Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ yields over German counterparts narrowed amid pro- gress on budget negotiations between the Italian govern- ment and the European Commission. The U.S. dollar appreciated modestly; although declines in U.S. yields weighed on the dollar, deteriorating global risk senti- ment provided support. Ongoing uncertainty about the passage of a Brexit withdrawal agreement put downward pressure on the exchange value of the British pound. Short-term funding markets functioned smoothly over the intermeeting period. Elevated levels of Treasury bills outstanding have continued to put upward pressure on money market rates. The EFFR held steady at or very close to the level of the IOER rate, while take-up in the overnight reverse repo facility remained near historically low levels. In offshore funding markets, the one-month foreign exchange swap basis for most major currencies increased, consistent with typical year-end pressures. Financing conditions for nonfinancial firms remained accommodative, on net, though funding conditions for capital markets tightened somewhat as spreads on non- financial corporate bonds widened to near the middle of their historical distribution. Gross issuance of corporate bonds also moderated in November, driven by a signifi- cant step-down in speculative-grade bond issuance, while institutional leveraged loan issuance also slowed in November. Small business credit market conditions were little changed, and credit conditions in municipal bond markets stayed accommodative on net. Private-sector analysts revised down their projections for year-ahead corporate earnings a bit. In many cases, nonfinancial firms’ earnings reports suggested that tar- iffs were a salient concern in the changed outlook for corporate earnings. The pace of gross equity issuance through both seasoned and initial offerings moderated, consistent with the weakness and volatility in the stock market. In the commercial real estate (CRE) sector, financing conditions remained accommodative. Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near post-crisis lows. Issuance of non-agency CMBS was sta- ble while CRE loan growth remained strong at banks. Financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained accommodative for most borrowers, but the demand for mortgage credit softened. Purchase mortgage origination activity declined modestly, while refinance activity remained muted. Financing conditions in consumer credit markets also re- mained accommodative. Broad consumer credit grew at a solid pace through September, though October and November saw credit card growth at banks edge a bit lower on average. Conditions in the consumer asset- backed securities market remained stable over the inter- meeting period with slightly higher spreads and robust issuance. Staff Economic Outlook With some stronger-than-expected incoming data on economic activity and the recent tightening in financial conditions, particularly the decline in equity prices, the U.S. economic forecast prepared by the staff for the De- cember FOMC meeting was little revised on balance. The staff continued to expect that real GDP growth would be strong in the fourth quarter of 2018, although somewhat slower than the rapid pace of growth in the previous two quarters. Over the 2018–20 period, real GDP was forecast to rise at a rate above the staff’s esti- mate of potential output growth and then slow to a pace below it in 2021. The unemployment rate was projected to decline further below the staff’s estimate of its longer- run natural rate but to bottom out by 2020 and begin to edge up in 2021. With labor market conditions already tight, the staff continued to assume that projected em- ployment gains would manifest in smaller-than-usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger-than-usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate. The staff expected both total and core PCE price infla- tion to be just a touch below 2 percent in 2018, with total inflation revised down a bit because of recent declines in consumer energy prices. Core PCE price inflation was forecast to move up to 2 percent in 2019 and remain at that level through the medium term; total inflation was forecast to be a little below core inflation in 2019, re- flecting projected declines in energy prices, and then to run at the same level as core inflation over the following two years. The staff’s medium-term projections for both total and core PCE price inflation were little revised on net. The staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion as similar to the average of the past 20 years. The staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as balanced. On the upside, household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected, supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year. On the down- side, trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on U.S. economic growth. Risks to the inflation Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 7_____________________________________________________________________________________________ projection also were seen as balanced. The upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer-term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast. Participants’ Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank pres- idents submitted their projections of the most likely out- comes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2021 and over the longer run, based on their individual assess- ments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each partici- pant’s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appro- priate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. These projections and policy assessments are described in the SEP, which is an ad- dendum to these minutes. In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received since the FOMC met in November indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. House- hold spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. Indica- tors of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance. In assessing the economic outlook, participants noted the contrast between the strength of incoming data on economic activity and the concerns about downside risks evident in financial markets and in reports from business contacts. Recent readings on household and business spending, inflation, and labor market condi- tions were largely in line with participants’ expectations and indicated continued strength of the economy. By contrast, financial markets were volatile and conditions had tightened over the intermeeting period, with sizable declines in equity prices and notably wider corporate credit spreads coinciding with a continued flattening of the Treasury yield curve; in part, these changes in finan- cial conditions appeared to reflect greater concerns about the global economic outlook. Participants also re- ported hearing more frequent concerns about the global economic outlook from business contacts. After taking into account incoming economic data, in- formation from business contacts, and the tightening of financial conditions, participants generally revised down their individual assessments of the appropriate path for monetary policy and indicated either no material change or only a modest downward revision in their assessment of the economic outlook. Economic growth was ex- pected to remain above trend in 2019 and then slow to a pace closer to trend over the medium term. Partici- pants who downgraded their assessment of the eco- nomic outlook pointed to a variety of factors underlying their assessment, including recent financial market de- velopments, some softening in the foreign economic growth outlook, or a more pessimistic outlook for housing-sector activity. In their discussion of the household sector, participants generally characterized real PCE growth as remaining strong. Participants pointed to a number of factors that were supporting consumer spending, including further gains in wages and household income reflecting a strong labor market, expansionary federal tax policies, still- upbeat readings on consumer sentiment, recent declines in oil prices, and household balance sheets that generally remained healthy despite tighter financial conditions. Although household spending overall was seen as strong, several participants noted continued weakness in residential investment. This weakness was attributed to a variety of factors, including increased mortgage rates and rising home prices. Reports from District contacts in the auto sector were mixed. Several participants noted that business fixed investment remained solid despite a slowdown in the third quarter, as more recent data pointed to a rebound in investment spending. Business contacts in several Districts reported robust activity through the end of 2018 and planned to follow through or expand on their current capital ex- penditure projects. However, contacts in a number of Districts appeared less upbeat than at the time of the November meeting, as concerns about a variety of fac- tors—including trade policy, waning fiscal stimulus, slowing global economic growth, or financial market volatility—were reportedly beginning to weigh on busi- ness sentiment. A couple of participants commented that the recent decline in oil prices could be a sign of a weakening in global demand that could weigh on capital spending by oil production companies and affect com- panies providing services to the oil industry. However, Page 8Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price decline could also be associated with increasing oil sup- ply rather than softening global demand. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported that condi- tions remained depressed, in part because of the effects of trade policy actions on exports and farm incomes, un- certainty about future trade agreements, and continued low commodity prices. Banks continued to report a gradual increase in agricultural loan delinquencies in re- cent months. Nonetheless, participants cited a few re- cent favorable developments, including new trade miti- gation payments as well as legislative action to maintain crop insurance that was seen as reducing uncertainty. Participants agreed that labor market conditions had re- mained strong. Payrolls continued to grow at an above- trend rate in November, and measures of labor market tightness such as rates of job openings and quits contin- ued to be elevated. The unemployment rate remained at a historically low level in November, and the labor force participation rate stayed steady, which represented an improvement relative to its gradual downward-sloping underlying trend. Several participants observed that la- bor force participation had been improving for low- skilled workers and for prime-age workers. A couple of participants saw scope for further improvements in the labor force participation rate relative to its historical downward trend, while a couple of others judged that there was little scope for significant further improve- ments. Contacts in many Districts continued to report tight la- bor markets with difficulties finding qualified workers. In some cases, firms were responding to these difficul- ties by using various types of nonwage incentives to at- tract and retain workers, while in other cases, firms were responding by raising wages. Many participants ob- served that, at the national level, most measures of nom- inal wage growth had risen and were currently at levels that were broadly in line with trends in productivity growth and inflation. Participants observed that both overall and core PCE price inflation remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis, but that core inflation had edged lower in recent months. A few participants noted that the recent de- clines in energy prices would likely only temporarily weigh on headline inflation. Several participants re- marked that longer-term TIPS-based inflation compen- sation had declined notably since November, concurrent with both falling oil prices and a deterioration in investor risk sentiment. A few participants pointed to the decline in longer-term inflation compensation as an indication that longer-run inflation expectations may have edged lower, while several others cited survey-based measures as suggesting that longer-run expectations likely re- mained anchored. Participants generally continued to view recent price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation would remain near the Com- mittee’s symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis. Although a few participants pointed to anecdotal and survey evidence indicating rising input costs and pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices, reports from business contacts and surveys in some other Districts suggested some moderation in inflation- ary pressure. In their discussion of financial developments, partici- pants agreed that financial markets had been volatile and financial conditions had tightened over the intermeeting period, as equity prices declined, corporate credit spreads widened, and the Treasury yield curve continued to flatten. Some participants commented that these de- velopments may reflect an increased focus among mar- ket participants on tail risks such as a sharp escalation of trade tensions or could be a signal of a significant slow- down in the pace of economic growth in the future. A couple of participants noted that the tightening in finan- cial conditions so far did not appear to be restraining real activity, although a more persistent tightening would un- doubtedly weigh on business and household spending. Participants agreed to continue to monitor financial market developments and assess the implications of these developments for the economic outlook. Participants commented on a number of risks associated with their outlook for economic activity, the labor mar- ket, and inflation over the medium term. Various factors that could pose downside risks for domestic economic growth and inflation were mentioned, including the pos- sibilities of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in global economic growth, a more rapid waning of fiscal stimu- lus, an escalation in trade tensions, a further tightening of financial conditions, or greater-than-anticipated neg- ative effects from the monetary policy tightening to date. A few participants expressed concern that longer-run in- flation expectations would remain low, particularly if economic growth slowed more than expected. With re- gard to upside risks, participants noted that the effects of fiscal stimulus could turn out to be greater than ex- pected and the uncertainties surrounding trade tensions or the global growth outlook could be resolved favora- bly, leading to stronger-than-expected economic out- comes, while a couple of participants suggested that tightening resource utilization in conjunction with an in- crease in the ability of firms to pass through increases in Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 9_____________________________________________________________________________________________ input costs to consumer prices could generate undesira- ble upward pressure on inflation. A couple of partici- pants pointed to risks to financial stability stemming from high levels of corporate borrowing, especially by riskier firms, and elevated CRE prices. In general, par- ticipants agreed that risks to the outlook appeared roughly balanced, although some noted that downside risks may have increased of late. In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants generally judged that the economy was evolving about as anticipated, with real economic activ- ity rising at a strong rate, labor market conditions con- tinuing to strengthen, and inflation near the Committee’s objective. Based on their current assessments, most par- ticipants expressed the view that it would be appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the fed- eral funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting. A few participants, however, favored no change in the target range at this meeting, judging that the absence of signs of upward inflation pressure afforded the Committee some latitude to wait and see how the data would de- velop amid the recent rise in financial market volatility and increased uncertainty about the global economic growth outlook. With regard to the outlook for monetary policy beyond this meeting, participants generally judged that some fur- ther gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would most likely be consistent with a sus- tained economic expansion, strong labor market condi- tions, and inflation near 2 percent over the medium term. With an increase in the target range at this meet- ing, the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run neutral interest rate, and participants expressed that re- cent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier. Against this backdrop, many participants expressed the view that, especially in an environment of muted inflation pressures, the Com- mittee could afford to be patient about further policy firming. A number of participants noted that, before making further changes to the stance of policy, it was important for the Committee to assess factors such as how the risks that had become more pronounced in re- cent months might unfold and to what extent they would affect economic activity, and the effects of past actions to remove policy accommodation, which were likely still working their way through the economy. Participants emphasized that the Committee’s approach to setting the stance of policy should be importantly guided by the implications of incoming data for the eco- nomic outlook. They noted that their expectations for the path of the federal funds rate were based on their current assessment of the economic outlook. Monetary policy was not on a preset course; neither the pace nor the ultimate endpoint of future rate increases was known. If incoming information prompted meaningful reassessments of the economic outlook and attendant risks, either to the upside or the downside, their policy outlook would change. Various factors, such as the re- cent tightening in financial conditions and risks to the global outlook, on the one hand, and further indicators of tightness in labor markets and possible risks to finan- cial stability from a prolonged period of tight resource utilization, on the other hand, were noted in this context. Participants discussed ideas for effectively communi- cating to the public the Committee’s data-dependent ap- proach, including options for transitioning away from forward guidance language in future postmeeting state- ments. Several participants expressed the view that it might be appropriate over upcoming meetings to re- move forward guidance entirely and replace it with lan- guage emphasizing the data-dependent nature of policy decisions. Participants supported a plan to implement another technical adjustment to the IOER rate that would place it 10 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate. This adjustment would foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC’s target range. Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members judged that information received since the Committee met in November indicated that the la- bor market had continued to strengthen and that eco- nomic activity had been rising at a strong rate. Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Household spending had continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance. Members generally judged that the economy had been evolving about as they had anticipated at the previous meeting. Though financial conditions had tightened and Page 10Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ global growth had moderated, members generally antic- ipated that growth would remain above trend and the labor market would remain strong. Members judged that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sus- tained expansion of economic activity, strong labor mar- ket conditions, and inflation near the Committee’s sym- metric 2 percent objective over the medium term. After assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, mem- bers decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent. Members agreed that the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would depend on their assessment of realized and expected economic condi- tions relative to the Committee’s maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives. They reit- erated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and in- ternational developments. More generally, members noted that decisions regarding near-term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately re- main dependent on the evolution of the outlook as in- formed by incoming data. With regard to the postmeeting statement, members agreed to modify the phrase “the Committee expects that further gradual increases” to read “the Committee judges that some further gradual increases.” The use of the word “judges” in the revised phrase was intended to better convey the data-dependency of the Committee’s decisions regarding the future stance of policy; the ref- erence to “some” further gradual increases was viewed as helping indicate that, based on current information, the Committee judged that a relatively limited amount of additional tightening likely would be appropriate. While members judged that the risks to the economic outlook were roughly balanced, they decided that recent devel- opments warranted emphasizing that the Committee would “continue to monitor global economic and finan- cial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.” At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the fol- lowing domestic policy directive, to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Effective December 20, 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2¼ to 2½ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse re- purchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conven- tions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such op- erations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day. The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each cal- endar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to in agency mortgage- continue reinvesting backed securities the amount of principal pay- ments from the Federal Reserve’s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed secu- rities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are ac- ceptable. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve’s agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.” The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p.m.: “Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate. Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. House- hold spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent. Indicators of longer- term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Minutes of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 11_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Com- mittee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be con- sistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and in- flation near the Committee’s symmetric 2 per- cent objective over the medium term. The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial devel- opments and assess their implications for the economic outlook. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee de- cided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2¼ to 2½ percent. In determining the timing and size of future ad- justments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its sym- metric 2 percent inflation objective. This as- sessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor mar- ket conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on fi- nancial and international developments.” Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Thomas I. Barkin, Raphael W. Bostic, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, Richard H. Clarida, Mary C. Daly, Loretta J. Mester, and Randal K. Quarles. Voting against this action: None. To support the Committee’s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to raise the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 2.40 percent, effective December 20, 2018. The Board of Governors also voted unanimously to approve a ¼ percentage point in- crease in the primary credit rate (discount rate) to 3.00 percent, effective December 20, 2018.6 It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, January 29–30, 2019. The meeting adjourned at 10:50 a.m. on Decem- ber 19, 2018. Notation Vote By notation vote completed on November 28, 2018, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on November 7–8, 2018. _______________________ James A. Clouse Secretary 6 In taking this action, the Board approved requests to estab- lish that rate submitted by the boards of directors of the Fed- eral Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco. This vote also encompassed ap- proval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 3.00 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Re- serve Banks, effective on the later of December 20, 2018, and the date such Reserve Banks informed the Secretary of the Board of such a request. (Secretary’s note: Subsequently, the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas were informed by the Secretary of the Board’s approval of their establishment of a primary credit rate of 3.00 percent, effective December 20, 2018.) The second vote of the Board also encompassed ap- proval of the establishment of the interest rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas for computing such rates. Page 12Federal Open Market Committee_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Summary of Economic Projections In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Commit- tee (FOMC) meeting held on December 18–19, 2018, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run.1 Each participant’s projections were based on infor- mation available at the time of the meeting, together with his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy— including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer- run value—and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projec- tions represent each participant’s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to con- verge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.2 “Ap- propriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to fos- ter outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. All participants who submitted longer-run projections expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, growth in real GDP in 2019 would run somewhat above their individual estimate of its longer-run rate. Most par- ticipants continued to expect real GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with a majority of participants projecting growth in 2021 to be a little be- low their estimate of its longer-run rate. Almost all par- ticipants who submitted longer-run projections contin- ued to expect that the unemployment rate would run be- low their estimate of its longer-run level through 2021. Most participants projected that inflation, as measured by the four-quarter percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), would increase slightly over the next two years, and nearly all participants expected that it would be at or slightly above the Committee’s 2 percent objective in 2020 and 2021. Compared with the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) from September, many participants marked down slightly their projections for real GDP growth and infla- tion in 2019. Table 1 and figure 1 provide summary sta- tistics for the projections. As shown in figure 2, participants generally continued to expect that the evolution of the economy, relative to their objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, would likely warrant some further gradual in- creases in the federal funds rate. Compared with the September submissions, the median projections for the federal funds rate for the end of 2019 through 2021 and over the longer run were a little lower. Most participants expected that the federal funds rate at the end of 2020 and 2021 would be modestly higher than their estimate of its level over the longer run; however, many marked down the extent to which it would exceed their estimate of the longer-run level relative to their September pro- jections. On balance, participants continued to view the uncer- tainty around their projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years. While most participants viewed the risks to the outlook as balanced, a couple more participants than in September saw risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside, and one less participant viewed the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside. The Outlook for Economic Activity The median of participants’ projections for the growth rate of real GDP for 2019, conditional on their individ- ual assessment of appropriate monetary policy, was 2.3 percent, slower than the 3.0 percent pace expected for 2018. Most participants continued to expect GDP growth to slow throughout the projection horizon, with the median projection at 2.0 percent in 2020 and at 1.8 percent in 2021, a touch lower than the median esti- mate of its longer-run rate of 1.9 percent. Relative to the September SEP, the medians of the projections for real GDP growth for 2018 and 2019 were slightly lower, while the median for the longer-run rate of growth was a bit higher. Several participants mentioned tighter fi- nancial conditions or a softer global economic outlook as factors behind the downward revisions to their near- term growth estimates. The median of projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 3.5 percent, unchanged from the September SEP and almost 1 percentage point below the median assessment of its longer-run normal level. With participants generally continuing to expect 1 Five members of the Board of Governors, one more than in September 2018, were in office at the time of the December 2018 meeting and submitted economic projections. 2 One participant did not submit longer-run projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate.

Neverthe- less, most participants continued to project that the un- employment rate in 2021 would still be well below their estimates of its longer-run level. The median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment was slightly lower than in September. Figures 3.A and 3.B show the distributions of partici- pants’ projections for real GDP growth and the unem- ployment rate from 2018 to 2021 and in the longer run. The distributions of individual projections for real GDP growth for 2019 and 2020 shifted down relative to those in the September SEP, while the distributions for 2021 and for the longer-run rate of GDP growth were little changed. The distribution of individual projections for the unemployment rate in 2019 was a touch more dis- persed relative to the distribution of the September pro- jections; the distribution moved slightly higher for 2020, while the distribution for the longer-run normal rate shifted toward the lower end of its range. The Outlook for Inflation The median of projections for total PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent in 2019, a bit lower than in the Septem- ber SEP, while the medians for 2020 and 2021 were 2.1 percent, the same as in the previous projections. The medians of projections for core PCE price inflation over the 2019–21 period were 2.0 percent, a touch lower than in September. Some participants pointed to softer in- coming data or recent declines in oil prices as reasons for shaving their projections for inflation. Figures 3.C and 3.D provide information on the distri- butions of participants’ views about the outlook for in- flation. On the whole, the distributions of projections for total PCE price inflation and core PCE price infla- tion beyond this year either shifted slightly to the left or were unchanged relative to the September SEP. Most participants revised down slightly their projections of to- tal PCE price inflation for 2019. All participants ex- pected that total PCE price inflation would be in a range from 2.0 to 2.3 percent in 2020 and 2021. Most partici- pants projected that core PCE inflation would run at 2.0 to 2.1 percent throughout the projection horizon. Appropriate Monetary Policy Figure 3.E shows distributions of participants’ judg- ments regarding the appropriate target—or midpoint of the target range—for the federal funds rate at the end of each year from 2018 to 2021 and over the longer run. The distributions for 2019 through 2021 were less dis- persed and shifted slightly toward lower values. Com- pared with the projections prepared for the September SEP, the median federal funds rate was 25 basis points lower over the 2019–21 period. For the end of 2019, the median of federal funds rate projections was 2.88 per- cent, consistent with two 25 basis point rate increases over the course of 2019. Thereafter, the medians of the projections were 3.13 percent at the end of 2020 and 2021. Most participants expected that the federal funds rate at the end of 2020 and 2021 would be modestly higher than their estimate of its level over the longer run; however, many marked down the extent to which it would exceed their estimate of the longer-run level rela- tive to their September projections. The median of the longer-run projections of the federal funds rate was 2.75 percent, 25 basis points lower than in September. In discussing their projections, many participants con- tinued to express the view that any further increases in the federal funds rate over the next few years would likely be gradual. That anticipated pace reflected a few factors, such as a short-term neutral real interest rate that is currently low and an inflation rate that has been rising only gradually to the Committee’s 2 percent objective. Some participants cited a weaker near-term trajectory for economic growth or a muted response of inflation to tight labor market conditions as factors contributing to the downward revisions in their assessments of the ap- propriate path for the policy rate. Uncertainty and Risks In assessing the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, FOMC participants take account of the range of possible economic outcomes, the likelihood of those outcomes, and the potential benefits and costs should they occur. As a reference, table 2 provides measures of forecast uncertainty—based on the forecast errors of various private and government forecasts over the past 20 years—for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and total PCE price inflation. Those measures are represented graphically in the “fan charts” shown in the top panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. The fan charts display the median SEP projections for the three varia- bles surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals de- rived from the forecast errors reported in table 2. If the degree of uncertainty attending these projections is sim- ilar to the typical magnitude of past forecast errors and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, then future outcomes of these variables would have about a 70 percent probability of being within these con- fidence intervals. For all three variables, this measure of Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 5_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Figure 3.A.

Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. uncertainty is substantial and generally increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. Participants’ assessments of the level of uncertainty sur- rounding their individual economic projections are shown in the bottom-left panels of figures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Participants generally continued to view the degree of uncertainty attached to their economic projections for real GDP growth and inflation as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.3 A couple more partici- pants than in September viewed the uncertainty around the unemployment rate as higher than average. Because the fan charts are constructed to be symmetric around the median projections, they do not reflect any asymmetries in the balance of risks that participants may see in their economic projections. Participants’ assess- ments of the balance of risks to their economic projec- tions are shown in the bottom-right panels of fig- ures 4.A, 4.B, and 4.C. Most participants generally judged the risks to the outlook for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, headline inflation, and core infla- tion as broadly balanced—in other words, as broadly consistent with a symmetric fan chart. Two more par- ticipants than in September saw the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside, and one less judged the risks as weighted to the upside. The balance of risks to the projection for the unemployment rate was un- changed, with three participants judging the risks to the unemployment rate as weighted to the downside and two participants viewing the risks as weighted to the up- side. In addition, the balance of risks to the inflation projections shifted down slightly relative to September, as one less participant judged the risks to both total and core inflation as weighted to the upside and one more participant viewed the risks as weighted to the downside. In discussing the uncertainty and risks surrounding their economic projections, participants mentioned trade ten- sions as well as financial and foreign economic develop- ments as sources of uncertainty or downside risk to the growth outlook. For the inflation outlook, the effects of trade restrictions were cited as upside risks and lower en- ergy prices and the stronger dollar as downside risks. Those who commented on U.S. fiscal policy viewed it as an additional source of uncertainty and noted that it might present two-sided risks to the outlook, as its ef- fects could be waning faster than expected or turn out to be more stimulative than anticipated. Participants’ assessments of the appropriate future path of the federal funds rate were also subject to considera- ble uncertainty. Because the Committee adjusts the fed- eral funds rate in response to actual and prospective de- velopments over time in real GDP growth, the unem- ployment rate, and inflation, uncertainty surrounding the projected path for the federal funds rate importantly re- flects the uncertainties about the paths for those key eco- nomic variables along with other factors. Figure 5 pro- vides a graphical representation of this uncertainty, plot- ting the median SEP projection for the federal funds rate surrounded by confidence intervals derived from the re- sults presented in table 2. As with the macroeconomic variables, the forecast uncertainty surrounding the ap- propriate path of the federal funds rate is substantial and increases for longer horizons. 3 At the end of this summary, the box “Forecast Uncertainty” discusses the sources and interpretation of uncertainty sur- rounding the economic forecasts and explains the approach used to assess the uncertainty and risks attending the partici- pants’ projections.

Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as “broadly similar” to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the conﬁdence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The conﬁdence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The conﬁdence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants’ individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to oﬀset the eﬀects of shocks to the economy. The conﬁdence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero—the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may diﬀer from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the conﬁdence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reﬂect FOMC participants’ current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections. * The conﬁdence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent conﬁdence interval if the conﬁdence interval has been truncated at zero. Summary of Economic Projections of the Meeting of December 18–19, 2018Page 15_____________________________________________________________________________________________ Forecast Uncertainty The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as em- bodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur. Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board’s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty as- sociated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty at- tending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly bal- anced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a prob- ability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 2.2 to 3.8 percent in the current year, 1.4 to 4.6 percent in the second year, and 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third and fourth years. The corresponding 70 percent con- fidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.8 to 2.2 per- cent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the second, third, and fourth years. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in “fan charts” that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants’ projec- tions for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and infla- tion. However, in some instances, the risks around the pro- jections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemploy- ment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median pro- jection. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncer- tainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants’ cur- rent assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec- tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those fig- ures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to par- ticipants’ projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summa- rized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant’s assessment of the appropriate stance of mone- tary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real ac- tivity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropri- ate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly con- sistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly out- comes but rather are projections of participants’ individual as- sessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end- of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeco- nomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy. If at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to pro- vide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.
